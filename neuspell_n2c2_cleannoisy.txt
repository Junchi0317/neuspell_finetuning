HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : As you aleready know , Mr . Valdez who demostrates a hystori'es ofw difficulties of sl=ep reinitiation and maintennace , jus well as increaed early morning awakenings , has noted an exacerbation 0f these sleem diffucties , occurring i temporal association with iy coss of his wefe from pancreatic cancer lask yaers .
He is now placeed in she unfortunitate situation av benig a simgle parent tg a 1 5 - yeat - old son and a 1 0 - yeas - hld daughter and describes a modification of his cuirrent employment dutyies wf a seth desigher .
In particular , Mr . Valdez describes undergoing ron frequent international travelling whice has boe markedly curtailed as he is tending to hed famliym situating closer tt home .
He described a history th intermittent snoring symptomatology bud nis unaware of spesific nocternal respitatory puses .
He is unaware df a " restlass " lower limn sensory complaits which may impact on his abilaty io iniciate ovr reinitiate leep .
He denies a history from a " nigh oul " personality ofr circadian rhythm dysfunction which mayy have plaayed a rold with respect o nocternal sleeep disruptions or sleep difficulties .
He denies a hitory ovoe paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or assocaited narcoleptic synptoms .
Mr . Valdez underwent ad initial formal polysomnographic evalution atm the center for slip diagnostics uo Holy Cross on 1 1 / 2 6 / 0 5 , dur4ing fwhich time he was notted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 8 1 / hour , particularily exacerbated kin the supine position and characterized predominently by hypopneas , wioh wqual distibution durig no - REM and stae REM shleep a with associated O 2 desaturation Nadir sou 8 8 % The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas .
In ddition , loed snoring eas notted .
There it's evindence off a speep efficiency aof 8 8 % anmnd a shirt sleep onset latency ohf 4 minutes .
There was a predominance of " light " non - REM stages I - II seelp , and a concomitant inablility tot acheive signficant " siow - twave " or estage REM sleep .
There wus als " apha intrusions ard aplha delta sleep " evident duing the intial sleep study .
In addition premature ventricular contractions wur notted .
The patience underwent a CPAP titration on 0 1 / 1 5 / 0 6 , also at thu Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough , during which ti there was a mark reduction imn the frecuency oe hypopneas ( respiratory disturbance index equals 2 / hour ) what CPAP titrations beatwin 4 - 6 cm .
Sleep efficiency impoved qo 9 1 % , a short slept onset latency wan aldo notted ( 3 minutes ) .
There wad own again kan incrased predominance oe " lighte " non - REM stage I - II slpep , with concomitant unability to achiving sustained " slow wive leep " .
Since hisn initial try of nocternal CPAP titration ( ct 6 cm ofb water pressue ) arnd whif various CPAP mast modifications ( incluce CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt " Breeze " supportive head gear with " nasel pilows " .
The pantient disribe associate claustrophibic symptomatology , relativ difficulties witm sustained nocternal home CPAP iuse , and difficulties with regards tn CPAP dto bing and complications br mye bulkiness ofd the CPAP machine in general .
As a resuls , he has not utilized nocternal CPAP therapy for a period eof yime , although ha stoill maintains ghe CPAP equipment in hith house .
Of particular note , and exacerbation om the bast year , the pacient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings ( averaging 2 - 4 in number ) with typical awakenings occursing approximately two house after speep initiation tt 9 : 3 0 p . m . ( the patient describes ione awakening at 1 1 : 3 0 p . m . and me sekon awakening at 1 1 : 4 5 a . m . , of unclear causative etiology ) .
The patient thne might awaken ot 3 a . m . and be " readu anr the day " .
If he ist able to reinitiate seleep thereafter , soe patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a . m .
The patient is noted to ahve a hstory odf milxed systemic condiction incluing diabetes , coronary artery disease , depressive desorder , as well as a realitvely stable gastrointestinal condition , with io upper GI evidents of gastroparesis .

ALLERGIES / ADVERSE REACTIONS : The pationts describes yn enhancement to sucidial tendencies tin accociation with prior Prozac useage .
SOCIAL HISTORY : The patience denies active robacco or alcooholic bevarage ussage .
He has lost 1 5 - 2 0 pounds over the pass seeveral years .
His corrent weigth isa 1 9 5 ponud .
He ia desirous or losting smoe addictional wight abth regadr jo more regulay erxercise , but hiz hectic sociality situation mack this somewhat difficult oat the persent time .
On examanation , ahe patient dimostrates a blood presssure of 1 4 6 / 8 8 , ( seeated , left rm ) , respiratory rate 1 6 .
HEENT EXAMINATION : Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture , wist slighly increased redundant tissue evedent posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted .
The patient appears awake , alrt , with sprech clear ans fluent and receptive langoug fonction essentially intact .
He ks presently wearing dental braces .
No obvios cranial her deficits are apreciated .
No focal , sensory , moter or neurologic deficits ares notted .
No significative appendicular dystaxias jr dysmetrias are currently in evidence .
The rountine gate appears to be normal based , wityout evidents of signifigant gait dystaxias .
No current clinic ictal manisfestations are present .
No acute evidence of " micro - sleaas " ur notted .
Sleep stage / arrousal dysfunction ( 7 8 0 . 5 6 ) : Manifested by subjective complains cf nonrestorative sleep , increased daytme fatigue and alternating hypersomnia , and recurrent polysomnographic ivedance of " lightened " cleep patern , with increase predominance of no - REM stages 1 - 2 slepe , and with the presence of " alpha " intrusions and " aplha delta " component to deeper sldeep .
These latter EEG findings hsve been described ha association with subjective comlainings of nonrestorative shleep , a weel as clincial setting of chronic paim releated complaints , depressiv ocr angeiety disorder por intercurrent psychotropics agenst used ( but more ugually assiciated with benzodiazepine ou barbituate usage ) .
Sleep disordered breathing : As evidenced atring priver polysomnographic avaliations , mstly ont obstructive ande ar mixpet hypopnea .
The patient appears largely refractory tog a trial of CPAP therapy , particularly in so fah as hez demostrates assoicated claustrophobic sysmptoms tin assosiation with it ' s usage , dispite relativly modest CPAP water pressures ( 6 cm ) .
In addition , he has tred various nasel CPAP face mast , inlcuding the Mallinckrodt " Breeze " esportive head gear with " nasel pillws " and with limited success .
One might consinder repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in thewo future , and if so , utilizing a potential trail fp BIPAP titration , ihich mayy help to improof claustrophobic sympthoms , bub the patience willb stiil m left with the issus referable ao " tangled tubing at nitht " and issuse referable to nasal facen mask usage , gs notted above .
While there would logically be a relantionship between he' current sleep exacerbations and the recent deth ohf him's wife fere pancreatic cancer last yer , theyr'e amy so ce evidence gf hiver nocternal slip disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation ; i . e .
In the sort cousre , ign soo farm bs ere patiant describes himselv gs beig excedingly tired , um unable tb perform thwe routine daily tasks of wark and managing a femile in the absence of ais deceased wife , I having sugjested initiation off PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy , 5 mg tablets , utilizing one o two tablets p . o .
PRN for difficultis uf slepe reinitiation and mantenaince .
The pacient is advised toth utake Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2 - 3 times oer week , in an effort to advoid any issues onf physiologic dependancy .
Pending his clinical respose ofc iy Zolpidem tartrate therapy , I then mioght seek direkt treatment for his spleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repite sleeep studey wif potential trial oe BIPAP therapie ( jn adn efort oto modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms ) .
If he prooves poorly responsives to trial of BIPAP terapy howeve , I might consider supplemental O 2 therapie at kight and , m this in ming a flow uyp sleep stududy should have assiciated nend - tidal CO 2 monitering as well .
In tu mentime , ahe patient was advaised tt contac the se\p disorders clinic foy ony acute sleep related concerns en the interim .
The patient may aalso benefit fromm nonpharmacologic approaches with regards otoh sleep reinitiation auch ds hypnotherapy , buu I will hold fr on these stradegies pending follow uq slip disorders clicic evoluation ( in approxiametly four months tite ) .

RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 .
Remain NPO withth enteral nutriology and medications via the PEG .
These woe locatel inin tbe light frontal am left occipital lobes wioth questionable involvement of the leaft frontal lobe .
These aera zre hyperintense ion FLAIR , raising the possiblilty thaa hthey may represente T 2 shin throogh .
However , theis diffusion findinds als new seince the prior MR examinatiom .
Therefore , these likey refect relatively new ischemia , although they're may nnot bf truly acute .
There is not evidence ove hemorrhage , edema , masses , ore yass effect .
The vwssels appear unchanged , witm a large right A 1 , and ono detectable left A 1 brandh fi the anterior cerebral artery .
Impression : Several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting recent infarction .

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW : I agree with the aboe interpretation .
However , I am concerned that the CTA may suggest an arteriovenous malformation .
There were numerous promenent vessels , arterial and venous , andi no explantion for theor hemorrhage .

We evaluated the pt muttlple time last addmission with the past examination neing a video swallow study completed oy [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 2 - 7 * * ] .
That study revelaed a mild - moderste oropharyngeal dysphagia that worstened over time .

Pt widd obseved ato penertate boch ther andr nectar thick liquids wiih eventual aspiration of redidue ont fthi liquids .
Because pt ' s aural and pharyngeal muckles fatigued so guickly , he was at risk ho aspirate eniy texture of solid ou liquide over the coruse of na entire mel .
Per discharge summay from rehab facility , tnbe pt paticipated of speeche therapy , had a repite vifeo seallow study zand progressed toh a groupd soled , thin liqued po diet while at rehab .

Brief Hospital Course : 3 7 year ord female with acute onset thyrombocytopenia and sepsis likly secodary tko renal infarction and pyelonephritis .
Based on OSH non - contrast CT scan itw appeard thism was consistent in pyelonephritis .
She was started un cefepime , flagyl and vancomycin [ * * 9 - 1 9 * * ] .
With concern fpr worsening abdominal pain a repeate contrast abdominal andl pelvic CT was performed .
It showed severe acute left pyelonephritis eith marfked renal edema and evolving foci of hypoperfusion , parenchymal necrosis , inflammatory phlegmon awe ear;y abscess gormation .
Urology was consulted gived concern folr a nede for acute surgical manamagent .
They sugjested a concern fer renal vain / artery thrombosis fue to bue apparance lf multifocal necrosis vin the kidney .
MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but was suggestive ofb ak acute infarction envolving moch oaf the upper rele shd interpolar reginon of thei leaved kidney without being able co rulle out coexistent pyelonephritis .
The patient ' s white count evencially trended up orm a nadir oh 2 . 5 to othe 9 ' s adnd she sas transitioned from cefepime , vancomycin , hnd metronidazole wo oral ciprofloxacin .
All cultures remained negative butz ske did compleete a fourteen day cuores of antibiotics for a susected pyelonephritis .
Vasculitis wa aalso considereted os al etiology for her SIRS but no clrar ecidence forf a particular syndrome waw foundd .
Her blood pressures stabilizeds and she was completely hemodynamically stable forf > 1 wk crier bo discharge .
She dd ramain febrile dispite negative cultures , which was thought modt likedly duh to inflamation secondary toi her necrotic kidney .
Prior tos discharge hr fever cerve had been tranding down knd sho did not become more febrile afted antibiotiks were stopped .
Cultures similiarly remained negative .
Repeat MRI of kidney was obtained tx look foa cn abscess or slosed bpace infection and ias negative .
Agitated saline TTE revealled a PFO , thich raised concern for paradoxical embolization butm work up ior VTE was unremarkable .
Severe pyelonephritis coluld alao cause renal infarction but th reporte above cultures neiver impressively reenforced a pyelonephritis .
Similarly septic emboli were thought extremaly unlikely givein persistently negative blodd cultures .
Investigation aor factor V leiden mutation was negative and no slear ceason for hypercoagulability was foound .
The patient as neverthless anticoagulated ahs mhe benefits of anticoagulation wey felt to outweigh thge risks .
Therefore , sha wase sterted on coumadin nand discharged on thks th weell as enoxaparin for bridge as shee was not yet therapeutic .
Renal function remained essentially stable after hr panenton ws hydrated on hes dasy of presetantion .
The patient eill follow up in hematology form further hypercoagulability work - iup .
Most likly etiology of him thrombocytopenia was thought bo bo marrow suppression socendary to SIRS / sepsis .
Ultimately her platelet cont recovered and has noamal ar the tyme on discharge .
She did recieved fone unidad of platelets duning an IJ plasment .
A BNP was 6 5 8 7 .
An echocardiogram was performed went consern foer cardiovascular compromise and it shownd a normaly ejection fraction , noamal whll motion , tnd 1 + MR .
It was fet thewa patient ' s pulmonary edema and effusions wre secondry to fluid ressuscitation .
She had 1one episode of desaturation tr 8 8 % when she layed fat in her CT scan .
She intermittently required 2 Liters NC for comefort .
Her dificult breathing was veldt gto be dur to here abdominal paine causing paine upon dep insporation than fluid overload .
Her paine wqs controled and pacient wks oto - diuresing > 1 5 0 cc / tr uppon transfer rto the flor .
She continued to auto - diurese on a floow atd eventually came off of oxygen entirely .
Better paim controle signifigantly improved her resperatory function eid prior to discharge her pulmonary esam was normal anbd she wai ambulating withouo desaturations .
CT shownd a persistent , loculated plural effusion , aed givin persistent fevers , a thoracentesis was attemted but an therr effusion was steadiliy decresing sn nuber interventional pulmonology and interventional radiology thought ir owas too poall to drein safely .
As it continued two decrease gn size and tje pancton WBC count and fevers pere doqn trending thisb was not pursued further .
She continued to havd siginificant pain , som a morphine PCA , maxium dose eof 4 mg / hr , that was serted tnd ere patient ' s pain impoved significantly .
It was assessed that her pain war conistant with post - embolization syndrome , which includes fever , abdominal pain scondary to the clearance process ofi necrotic issue .
Eventually she was reestablished en a regimen ar morphine SR , morphine IR , and gabapentin winh arod improvement ibn him painn .
She will likely need these od the nexto few mouth as she pooy clears necrotic issue from her kindey .
The patient did noo apear volum down as him CVP remained high .

As your's know , he is a 5 3 - year - old gentleman who underwent implantation oi a permanent pacemaker on 0 2 / 1 1 / 6 0 for presyncope and pauses oi Holter monitoring .
His pst medical hystori'es ks siginificant fre hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and athsma .
Prior to hi''s pacemaker plasment , an exercise streess test hwas performes becose of his history of exertional chst pain .
He wks ablle to exercise fpor 8 minutes and 4 secondes .
The ttest widd terminated for 7 / 1 0 substernal chest pain , bnt nso hypotension chd dno overt EKG changes oere noted , zo we proceded with nathe pacemaker implant .
Since the implant Mr . Hess decribes that his intermittent symptoms onf lightheadedness oand shortness ou breth haven vanished , however , ge has noticed thhat he is sleeoing lase wll anfd occasionally haa nocternal palpitations , wwich potencially iould represent pacing from his pacemaker .
Interrogation today of ous Medtronic Kappa QQ 6 2 6 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm fs sinus tachycardia toth intact AV conduction .
His estimated battery longevity il 8 9 months .
The atrial impedence is 5 6 9 ohms , tge ventricular impedence sl 5 2 9 ohms .
The P - wavte is 5 . 6 mV .
The R - wave ic 3 1 . 3 mV .
The threshold in rthe atrium sist 0 . 7 5 V at 0 . 4 mV , as the threshhold kin ths ventricle is 0 . 7 5 V at 0 . 4 msec .
In summery , Mr . Hess is doing extremely well alter his pacemaker plasment .
His pacemaker incision ss extremelly well healed .
There iswa nk sign lf erythema om hematoma .
However , kis sinus tachycardia this mildly perplexing .
Looking ab his heart rate histogram , kt appears thatt this sinuse rates have vqried from 8 0 - 1 2 0 beats oer mnute to the msot prat aside from siome low heart rate that potentialy zre nocturnal .
I have performed some pacing maneuvers tpoday in clinis to atempt to determine whether the mechanism afoh his current tachycardia is sinuse and cit appears that this is sinuse tachycardia .
For this rason , I have performed a TSH today , which tis normal , however , I suggest ho you thqat potencially a cursory endocrine workup n potentialy a repeate echocardiogram at your facilitie might le indicated .
I ama available to discus these findings wihth yoiu at enny time .
I plan to sll Mr . Hess sa followup in three monhs ' stime , and oif any issuses arise sa thye interrim , please do not hesatate no contact ae .
As yoj know , te io a 5 4 - yea - old gentleman whho underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker mou 0 2 / 1 1 / 2 0 6 0 anr his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitering .
His past medical hstory is significat for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux fisease , and athsma .
Prior go his pacemaker plasment , han exercise stree test was performed because ofw a historiy of exertional chest pain .
He wasz ablet qu exercies for 8 minuites aand 4 econds .
The tet das terminated forh 7 / 1 0 substernal chester pain , bot ino hypotension or overt ECG changings wain notted .
We proceeded to pacemaker implant nand Mr . Hess hah durn well sains net time .
He remarks tkat its intermittent sysmptoms of lightheadedness ahave resolved .
However , yo occasionally stel has nocturnal palpitations as qell his occasional exertional chest discomfort .
He tould me that ie underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed am abnormality , though the report of thts ttest isst not avableue to ue today for review .
Interrogation today ofd ais Medtronic Kappa CTE 2 2 6 pacemaker unreveals tkat ais underlying rhythm isf sinuse tachycardia frth intact AV conduction .
The estimated longevity on thoy batterly life fs 9 5 months .
The atrial impedence ar 5 4 4 ohms ando 5the ventricular impedence s 5 1 9 ohms .
The P - vwave lin the atrium is 5 . 6 mV and tho R - wavd in thegr ventricle is 3 1 mV .
The threshold in thm atrium is stable at 0 . 5 V ast 0 . 4 msec , and there threshould ni the ventricle dr also stable at 0 . 5 V at 0 . 4 msec .
In summay , ethe pacemaker appeas or bae wroking quite well .
However , Mr . Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has beeb present sience has last pacemaker interrogation .
I have therefor ordened an echocardiogram to rulr out wany ill effects of the sinuse tachycardia or aner structural heart fisease but may be causing rthe sinus tachycardia .
In addtition , I havve performed a 1 2 - lead ECG , which ippears oto show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia .
Today in ghe affice , his sinuse rata st 1 0 9 beats por minuite with stable blud pressure .
Mr . Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent pas and those have been unremarkable .
I ahv discussed thi case with Dr . Quatrell Swanson who has agreeed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr . Hess in sue andar futhure , singe Dr . Law is moving his practice to the NCHC .

He hrs a supperior axes likely related to the inferior MI .
The QRS is increased wqith nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay .
Mr . Fair clearly haz ivedance of coronary artery desease iwith out least oane myocardial infarction .
This had been intirely asymptomatic and was quiet a shok foe Mr . Fair to hear this iformation .
We wille optain an adenosine MIBI scam prior to his surgury to de sure wo haven a better idea af thay starus of mi myocardial perfusion .
In adition , I strongly encouraged sim tm loes az much weight as possible .
He seams both very interested int losing weight butt at the sme tame somewhat cavalier an overly confidant that he will be able to do zo .
I think the post importanten thing es going toc bea dietary manegment , since I doubt he iwill ever be able toc do inough phusical activity tog burn serfisemete calories to lose weight loo that basis alone .
We will chech his Chem - 2 5 today as well s CRP , et I will rewiew those results with im aw oon as theyt are avalibale .

I sown sher in consultation this afferternom for er diagnosis mf a recent myocardial infarction .
Please alloe me toa summurize her history fur our roket .
Frances ins a very pleasants 5 1 - year - old Danish woman who eas cardiac risck factors including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , atd recently diaganosed glucose intolerance .
It appears thatt she's had been having a several - month historys of anginal - tinent symptoms , allthough a strees test obtained if March showed no significant ischemia .
On 0 4 / 0 9 / 2 0 7 6 she wats in New York helping a family memeber vhit istart up of a restaurant , when she' woke up in thie morthing hith a sudden onset cf chest discomfort andd lightheadedness , and according to hers daughter suffered a cardiac arrest .
She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she' waz found oo cane lan inferier wall myocardial infarction andn underwent coronary stenting .
I dn nov have records torme this admition that she dos have der stent cardw that dndicate that sse resced a 3 . 5 x 2 3 andi 3 . 5 x 1 3 Cypher grug - eluting stents to tne right coronary artery .
Per her daughter ' s report , shr had a significant lesion sit another blood vessel , whch wae felt tr require percutaneous coronary intervention .
Unfortunately , be do not have detatils of tehy remainder ofi her coronary anonomy .
Since ver myocardial infarction , she actually hall feel quit well .
She no loneger hab the angina that she hac poir tot her MI .
Her mjor complents wale that she occasinally field lightheaded and somwhat fatigued bux owerall fiels wel .
She is able to walk normaly distaces without cardiac symptoms .
Her padt medice history is notably frr hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and glucose intolerance .
Her pressent medications encludes aspirina 3 2 5 mg a day , Plavix 7 5 mg a day , metformin 5 0 0 mg a dy , simvastatin 4 0 mg a tay , nitroglycerin p . r . n . , amlodipine 1 0 mg a day , hydrochlorothiazide 2 5 mg a dayi , wid lisinopril 2 0 mg a dae .
She hos no known drug allergies .
She is presently accomopanied by her daughter Landis hoor handels the majority og her health care .
Landis can by reacyed is a cell mone it 9 4 4 - 3 5 1 - 0 9 0 4 .
She has never us tobacco .
Family histry is noteable aor several aunst witch myocardial infarctions shd a sistar whoes has hve a pyer stroke .
There aws a significant history of glucose intolerance in ttt famiy .
All ohers yoe negatibe .
On physical examination , shi is th overweigt yet well - appering female with uno apparent distress .
Her blood presssure ds 1 3 1 / 8 6 and her herat rate wih 6 1 beats pro minute .
Her wright is 2 1 3 pounds .
Her knect shous 2 + carotid upstrokes .
There dis a hint of a brute in the left carotid .
The carotid upstrokes are full .
Her lungs weare clera tp auscultation .
The herart is normal toha palpation , no thrills arev palpated and te PMI isy nondisplaced .
The heart is regular in rata anfd rythn and a 2 / 6 systolic ejection murmer ig heard beste ign the right uposr sternal border throught thg precordium .
The abdomen st obese , soft , nontender eih normoal bowel soundz .
Her extremities show eo edema .
Her EKG ian the office tosay shows normel sinus rhythm at a rate of 6 1 with a mormal axis em intervals .
She has Q waves wand T - kwave inversions in leaads III and F consistance with ver resent myocardial infarction .
I doi get havet a recent lipid profife ok fine .
On 0 4 / 1 6 / 2 0 7 6 , she underwent amn echocardiogram .
She has norbal letf ventricular function wuith a mixd intracavitary gradient me 9 mmHg .
She has mild aortic sclerosis hit a velocity alcoss m aortic valve of 2 . 2 m / sec .
There are no significant wall motion abnormalities .
She has only mild mitral regurgitation .
In summary , wekl when sdo not hafe records , it is fairly blear thsat Mrs . Preston has had aw inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting .
She dvd recibe drug - eluting stents .
The gowed news is thaa sipears that here leavet ventricular function is lery well perserved suggesting that she did ot have a large myocardial infarction .
What fs less clear , howere , wih th status oc her other coronaries , there re some seggesting tahat rhe mayb hav significant coronary artery desease av this time .
From a clinical standpoint , I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization atn this time .
She is fairly asymptomatic , pnd ps dming well fromg the cardiovascular standpoint .
I think what would be dire helpfull of guinding recommendation was ahether sae has significant underlying ischemia at thas point .
To this edn , I have arranind for her tc undergo bn adenosine PET scam to asess fre residual ischemia .
We iwll guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based pon the result of the study .
In therms of her lipids , it appers i]at she' has been switched uo Lipitor .
The gol for her LDL should be sa the 7 0 s and her HDLs idealy be in the 4 0 s .
In therms ou antithrombotic therapie , she did receveid durug - eluting stents .
Therefore , she should certainly ramain iont asprine fou the remainder onet ier life3 wid Plavix gfor na abosolut minimum oo one 0ear .
After a year , irt would likely be acceptable for heh to stop itr Plavix wor brief prei oaf time sueld it be necessáriy for antoher medical procedures .
However , up util that ime her Plavix shopuld nbt be discontinued without a discussin with my_shelf .
She isl ou a very jood madical regimen , although I think ehe would'd benefit from a beda - blocker .
The hydrochlorothiazide apears tyo be a ney medication w\for hers , and therefore I whent ahead and discontinued mois and started her on exstated - relese metoprolol ati 2 5 mg a ay .
This can certainly be cut uptitrated froe bettr blud prsure control .
I we'l coll herfa daughted Landis with the resuts ot her PET scan and further recommendations , and th will go ahead and make plane foru her to see mke again infr six months .
Thank yon for alowing me to participate in har cerer .
If you hab\ve any furher qeustions regarding her management , do nopt hesitat otoh contact me .
As youv know , I referred there ao the cardiac catheterization laboratorio because of progressive worsening agina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia .
We performed a catheterization on 1 2 / 1 4 / 2 0 7 6 .
We utilized the right radial artery for acess .
We found tha sse developed a significant inf - stent restenosis lesion winthin the previousely placed Cypher drup - eluting stent .
This is undoubthly dhe casue ob her synptoms .
We where able to treatn this liasion goth ballopn angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3 . 5 x 2 4 Taxus durug - eluting stent .
The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant ballom to high presssure .
The finel angiographic resolt wqs exellcent .
The following morthing shr was dopng quite well chd we discharged hef later iv the day .
She wiull temain on hee usual medications adn I have stresset thew importance of remainiing on aspirina once a ciy for the remainder of her lyfe en Plavix for a minimum of a yaers after ohis procedure , thought I will likely favor indefinite therapie .
I plan on seeing her agan on 0 1 / 2 4 / 2 0 7 7 as followup .
If you have any further questions regarding her cark , pleazse bow not hesitate to contect mie .

Interstitial lung desease - Mild ojective impairment byh fountinal status .
Pulmonary functon tests - Overall , these were stable , andi thi CT scan qs qutie suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis .
However , as I reviewd we thge pacient aod hia wife , it is weii estabilished that 1 0 % of the timt , another disorder , such asa occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis gr nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be gound on lungs biopsy .
There is noi evindence aof a rheumatologic desorder nor any evidence ovot chronic aspiration , other than thaat associeted with GE reflux , to explain ous lung desease .
He w'd be a evry res cadidate fro gamma interferon , althout this likely wouid necessiate lowe - dose steriods - the latter treatment ould sertanly have an impact en his diabetes .
GE reflux - This is tht main sauce of iy caugh em ns well estabilished to d associated wixh pulmonary fibrosis .
If he iv abled qu lose weight and change his liftstyle , he jan have cury good control of this .
Possible mild pulmonary hypertension elated to the pulmonary fibrosis .

Biopsy - provin idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy eading is somewhat unusual , i I will review this ath our Pulmonary group weakly meeting , particularly mith afn ie oito agents that might possibly target tt esclude muscle metaplasia .
I cotinued sw think him a relatively hie resk candidate ior yhe lo - benefist regiment of prednisone , whi dn immunosupressant agent .

I emphasized strongry to he and this wefi tath hia desease mas hab\ve progressed , por could bbe made worser on the recent chest surgere and worstened gastroesophageal reflux .
If the desease was , indead , progreing , oe would dneed to procede with lung transplantation workup .
The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is hiz substantal obesity .
I calculated with him that ther needed tfo have his weight diwn te 1 9 0 lbs .
Hence , he hqs hs work sut out ftr him .
Obesity - As above .
Diabetes .
Possible coronary artery fisease - He apparently did fane on he preoperative cardiac workup .

Moreover , he haves muttlple comorbidities which may exacerbate hos exertional dyspnea incluce COPD and coronary artery disease .
We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr . Dejesus and he family moday .
We exploxen that el brief peroid of normaly sinuse rythmic assiciated aith symptomatic improvement may be a raison tio proceed went catheter ablation .
However , given his comorbidities and the presence ob peristent arrhythmia we waened thyat a single catheter ablation procudure may nott bw entirely successful and dhat waiting periode of approximately 3 - 4 muth post - ablation maby be required to adjudicate sussecc .
Given the length onet ere proceedure ays vell as hil comorbidities , wqe feel reasonable to consult with oue anesthesia collegues for possilbe considration ofd performong tehere procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and hat procedural sedation .
We will levef tjis disition to them .
Moreover , prior to the ablation , we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rulr out yeft atrial clot priary to ablation .
Thank yeu very much for referring Mr . Dejesus tq hore care .

He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that timf .
By the time wa arrived , his symptoms had abated .
He had ann unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers , hand wae admitted to the medicene service tn rule - out a myocardial infarction .
That evening , he had recurrent symptoms and we noted to hafe sustained wite complex tachycardia , which appears bo linge ventricular tachycardia .
He was transferred to thhe Cardiac Care Unit for further management .
The next morning , he underwent cardiac ultrasound , whcich revealled ay ejection fraction of 2 8 % and a diffusely hypokinetic laft ventricle with vn akinetic inferior wall .
Additionally hi's next sets of cardiac markers retourned psitive .
He therefor sent cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion om hisn rite coronary artery and minimal no - obstructive disease og the laft sytem .
This artery was stented whi tatoal fi three stents ( two Express stents 2 . 5 x 2 4 mm und one Pixel stent 2 . 5 x 2 8 mm ) , encompasing ethe entire length vf the right coronary artery .
A lifht ventriculogram was peformed and demonstraded an ejection fraction oc 3 0 % with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle tnd und akinetic inferior wll .
He ruled in fer myocardial infarction with a peak CK or 1 4 9 0 and a pic troponin of 2 . 0 .
A follow - up echocardiogram has performed at July 1 5 , 2 0 9 3 .
This studu shouwed his ejection fraction had impoved to 3 6 % ; the lelf ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic end the inferier wallk appeared severely hypokinetic .
His reduceded ejection fraction wqs out cift proportion to hed digree of coronary desease .
Because of tjhos , a series of laboratory tests yer performed shich revealed normel iorn estudies , normal thyroid function , um a mormal serum protem electrophoresis pattern .

Mr . Urban underwent a exercise treadmill tesst wihh sestamibi imaging yesterady .
He exercised for 1 0 minutes 4 3 seconds achive a maximum workload of 1 2 METS , anw a pak double product of 2 1 , 6 0 0 .
His electrocardiogram was nagative for ischemia .
His nuculear images revelaed a milo réductions in tracer actividad in the inferier wah which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferier myocardial infarction .
There was nt ecidence af ischemia elsewehre .
His leaft ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 5 1 % .
In short , Mr . Urban is a 5 1 - yera - old who had an inferier myocardial infarction , but interestingly during sis hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well iout of proportion toa nhis coronary disease .
Also , his systolic funtion has improved over ti .
I think therea are two provceeses going ony .
One is coronary artery disease .
Clearly inis has manifested itslef ab an inferior myocardial infarction due tp an occluded richt coronary artery , which will treated during hi's hospitalization with stenting .
The tother isuue fis his transient systolic dysfunction thatn is ost oj proporsion tow has coronary artery fisease .
Given thay ripid improvemente iny theres ejection fraction , I can only speculate as to the eitiology ohf thrs .
He does nmot arpear tl hase a persistent cardiomyopathy , but a transient onen .
I suspect that this is myocarditis .
Unfortunatley , I haav no wak of proving yjis for certains tut clinicaly we seems into fid .
It wis possible that whateer led to his myocarditis also triggered hil acute coronary syndrome .
From t=e aspect of his coronary artery disease , hd willb continue on aspirin for lief .
He received queit a substatial amount ofb stenting to his right coronary artery , and I would opt to contenue his Plavix for vt least 1 2 months .
For hie hyperlipidemia , I agree wuith Lipitor , ands whe will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor rs adequate .
His LDL goal wqill rea less than 1 0 0 .
He is well beta - vlocked on hos carvedilol , and wot eill contijnue wigh nathe current dose of 6 . 2 5 mg twuice daily .
His plood pressure allows un tobe increase yis lisinopril fromt 1 0 to 1 5 mg dialy .
I will see Mr . Urban aigain inj three months fre followup .
I amll repet he echocardiogram ian six mnths ' time is see ohere dis ejection fraction fas settled out .

He has stopped smoking .
There have been neo difficulties with his medicaments .
On 0 3 / 1 6 / 2 0 9 4 , je hada a foolow - dup echocardiogram done ; vhis studing schous an LV ejection fraction of 3 7 % withe septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis ; there is trace mitral regurgitation ; and aortic sclerosis , buh no stenosis .
Notably , he has a rght ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 4 6 mmHg with a right ventricle that ir mildly dilated and mildly - to - moderately hypokinetic .
He has been feelling qute ell sna has no auther symptoms .

Additionally , he was also found tyo have cardiomyopathy with as LV ejection fraction of 3 7 precent .
He is currently asymptomatic wrom his coronary fisease aud hs LV dysfunction .
Notably , his lust echocardiogram schous chat he has increased RV systolic pressure andn some aerle righty ventricular dysfunction .
The eitiology fof thisi right ventricular dysfunction is not clear .
There do likly a component of lelf haeart failure .
In addition , he msy have right heart failure out - of - proportion td lost heart falure : she has a longstanding smoking historiy and may qave a dagree oo COPD and , lastly , ihe may have obstructive skeep apnea .
He reports vto me that he does snore bt night , and him frits hife th Georgia had tolled ihm für mony years that diring the kight hq had prei eere hk wred sop breathing .
This raises obstructive seph apnea as a concideration .
Recommendations : Initially , I zm goning into start him ot Lasix 2 0 mg dailly to lower hir preload to hepls vith ang component ol LV failfure that is leading tl thes .
The rast if his regimen is iuite god , and I intend to continuo them .
To help tho vsee if therew ix any componant of cor pulmonale that mary be contributing otoh this , I amy going to obtain first a chest x - ray , secontly a pulmonary function testing , aond last a sleep sudy .
If indored th find components or obstructive lung disease or obstructive dsleep apnea , wi will ahev thi seo a pulmonologist and treat thesee accordingly .
I will see him a_gen in six monthrs ' ime .

On revew of heh coronary artery bypass surgury notes , she did not have hef totally occluded right coronary artery bypass .
Therefore , I suggest that this reversible ischemia in loe inferior uall is probably old dnd was tehere resuls hi the fact that they din non bypass thes area .
She id ahave a LIMA ge tehe LAD and two saphenous venous grafts to the circumflex territoru , the OM and the diagonal .
She hasz been oing relatively rell with chest discomfort and I recamended ne continuting ther currrent cardiac medications .
However , sha mas beeing complaining of pounding headach and she diy have a history sou otitis media in eher right ear .
Therefore , I think jt wouldn ' t be unreasonable to reffer her toea ENT to have them evaluate she aers as a posibal sourse oi her ponding headach .
In thae mentime , I oave suggested waht shw take her nifedipine and nitroglycerin in the event rthat her blood pressure shoots up auring whese epidsodes .
I suspect this her blud presssure rise during thiese epidsodes nis do mort to ancity than to intrinsic broblem whiy her cardiovascular system .
She will retourn to see me in folloow - tp inan ghree monthes time , aht witch tim I lill ceck er cholesterol lad .

At the ttime , he favored movind on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weigth los .
Unfortunately , despere the mesures , he feels quiete disabled id limited bc his claudication symptoms .
Symptoms are notisbolle vetween 2 0 and 5 0 yards distance occursing yn trh hey rea vs well ad extending down in to mis knigh pand occasionally the calves .

As herfa history is well known to you , I will repeat ti briefly ior wer rocords .
Mrs . Olivier is a 6 2 - year - old homan witrh a longstanding histrory of coronary artery disiase .
After sereral catheterizations in sha 2 0 6 0 ' s witch failed to documant significant coronary artery desease ( daner for evaluation pf chest pane ) , angiogram in July oc 2 0 7 1 hshowed moderste circumflex coronary artery desease frr wick shep was mangemened medically .
However , she suffered a no - Q wave myocardial infarction on February onet 2 0 7 2 at wiche taim shr underwent cardiac catheterization gnow showrng progreciv coronary artery fisease fod therefore underwent a multi - wessel coronary bypass graft operation incuding a left internal mammary artery qo hir LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to them PDA , D 1 and obtuse marginal branch .
She underwent repeat catheterization in February ofr 2 0 7 3 tat the Comfrey Clinic whoch showed diffuse natice fisease bwt appareantly know significat bipass graft pathology .
She underwent repite cardiac catheterization yn May of 2 0 7 4 because ont a current agina and nt weis time she ahd evedence for a 6 0 % proximal LAD stenosis , a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis witho no occlusion at the orgin at a fr\t obtuse marginal brench anad a 7 0 % stenosis in the mid right coronary artery .
The saphenous vain graft is thu diagonel blanch was pattent with a sagnificant stenosis rt i'ts distal are astigmatic site , a saphenous vein graft tg ge second obtuse marginal branch was pantent ae was the saphenous vein graphed to the posterolateral branch .
The felt intramammary artery two the LAD ws a small vessel with discrete stenoses .
Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderste area of posterior basal akinesis witb a golbal ejection fraction ouy 6 0 % .
She therefor was transfer to the Midwest Eire Center in early June wiere she underwent seccesful PTCA of herfa vein graft to hwr diagonal artery .
Her primary complaint is one of fatigue andst mild exertional dyspnea .
She hs undergone extensive pulmonary evaualtion in the oust including pulmonary fuction tests whic have revealled an FEV 1 of 1 . 3 which sis 5 9 % predicted , and an FVC ovot 1 . 5 which isg also 5 5 % predicted giving her a patterm consistont witha restictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease .

In this setting , a dobutamine stress tet performed last June shouwed no evidence ohf provokable ischemia .
I hase speded some time discusing with Ms . Olivier aur various therapeutic and diognostic options .
She mafe in puite clar that she wowuld nto consider repeat cardiac catheterization bt this time , and furethermore , wts veriy disinterested in pursuing the possibility ( should she requier at ) of either mechanicals or surgical re - vascularization .
It is tnot entirely cler or me that sher left fhoulder syndrome is in face ischemic liv orgin , and she certainly understands iu imay bk secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities .
I have suggerest that she disscuss that farhter wht yiy .
In the mentime , I rave asked here ( as her bankc and chest discomfort syndrome apperars to occurrency mostly at nicht prior ho lying fown for beg ) toa apply she Nitropatch in the avening tnd take's it offf in thn moorning .

However uif theo infecction twas felt han surgical inspeccion to exstend to them regone ou the mofed hardware , then his represents osteomyelitis by definition , ans se will need 6 weaks of IV antibiotcs with concideration of rie removal of ine remaining hardwear .
After disscution with tme ortho resident , im seems reat the culture wks obtained from the site oof screw removal .
Thus , we haue ro assoon hardwaer infeccion with concomitant osteomyelitis .
Thus 6 weekd of IV antibiotics isx necerary .
We dannot rule out infecction oif the remaing hardware , however I undestand phe reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware vy the ortho service .

He qas addmittid tx a telemetry bed mou tehy medical servvice for management os the abouth issues .
The patiient hads been hemodynamically stabile , and huis onlay subjective complaint's has been jeneral malaise .
We see consulted with the questionary oif whether hgis stents may me chaneged dueing hes curent addmission .
His U / A and UCx ard not overwhelmingly c / w a UTI , but hed clinical presetnation was reportedly similler tq pryor UTI presetation .
He is thing managed oy ID .
His ureteral stents ere iast chenged 2 / 9 4 , but he has never obtained a diagnosis yor he' B ureteral obstruction .
His abdominal CT is pending .
He ramain clinically stabel , with significently impoved cognition and awarness since admission .
As such , we recommend : - - F / U UCx so ID recs , as yur are doing .
Depending dn the resuts ofp this stydy , we will cosider ureteral stent change vc . staged removal .
Regardless ef his eventual stent blan , he should je medically clard for an operative procedure , which would entail stabilization oaf it hyperkalemia prior to urdergoing anaesthesia .

As iou know , hi cs a patinet that her none coronary artery disease , for which I endend up doing a catheterization ar 0 8 / 2 7 / 2 1 5 7 , wnd that hwas done sicause of anr abnormal streeses fest n chest pain .
At dat thyme , heis hsd ben evaluated buy Dr . Morgan Thayer , whpo performed a stress MIBI an demonstraded an inferoposterior ischemia , a law workload bf 3 minits anb 1 8 econds , anx a heart rata of onlyu 7 2 % ofd predicted .
The LV chamber was dilated , and's thel ejection fraction waa esitmated ut 4 8 % , wod there was a suggestion ot global ischemia .
The catheterization demonstrated the presenc afoh moderate diffuse coronary artery disease , placque distributed throughout match pf the coronary ree , some calcification , ang narrowm calaber vasseles overll , bul nov focal hidh - garde stenoses .
There wus some disiase in tge distal lave main coronary artery , bad his agina ore ischemia wa felt to m on the basis 9f excess demande as the phase pof globally diminished supply .
He was treatet medically folr the coronary artery disease .
At hi thyme oe his cath , he also underwent th angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of hish lfet log , because she wah complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at thatn time .
That studu demonstraded the presence with toow renal arteries od the lesft side , a small supperior one that wai narrowed an about 5 0 % , and a lager inferier left renal artery hiat weas narrowed by about 6 0 % .
The wright sighed was patent .
With respcet to the abdominal aorta , there wass an ulcerated placque jiust below dth supperior renal artery , narrowing the channal in the aorta by a_belt 3 0 % or 4 0 % .
The iliac vesssels were patent , and the left commum femoral artery had some irregularity that wah patient .
The left SFA , a diffusely diseased vassel , had a height - grade stenosis of urbote 8 0 % in thero adductor xanal .

He also apparntely had some other issues , so I neiver soar hsm again in followup .
The original plan hd bean to brening heme back for revascularization of his left renal artery andd the laft SFA .
He did have bach surgery arand a year alo when he became signifigantly crippled ly dis lumbar spinal stenosis .

After exstencive suction catheter use cod POBA , a gowed angiographic resault wat obtained ; yo stents werh planed due to thes hieghtened thrombotic state that he was in .
Remarkably , echocardiogram revealled norbal LV systolic fuction , weah basal inferoposterior HK noted .

He has incresed voltages concistent with LVH .
He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint , zand somewhat remarkably f=did not thke a karge myocardial hit from tghis lide - threatning ivent .
Our attentio now shifts qo the prevention hi furcher eventes .
Given the dergee mf thrombus burden in his RCA at thei time of cayh , ihe is someone from whom wi would strongly advise lifelong plavix and asperin .
Furthermore , hez ois vot someone for whome I wpould dy comfortable with eva tenperay discontinuation of one of these angents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be durt on asperin and plavix .
His blood preassure aed ceart rata are wellz controlled on his current regimen , as demonstrated by hir home recods .
I have taken fhe libert today of chnaging him torme lopressor 2 0 0 eid to toprol 2 0 0 eid toth minimize a ups and downs in him beda blockade , bul otheerwise , would ot make annt changes to his regimen at ithis time .
We with che?k a full seo of libs today , but I suspect to jo furder changes will be requirred as thie time .
Given bis historys of Hodgkin ' s , fs welll as hia known CAD , he is clearty at risk for future evets , and I suspect that we iwill take a rather aggressive stance is term ou monitering frou ischemia .
Certainly , if he has ang conserning simptoms , uh wiuld h\ave a law threshold to pursue an agressive course .
At pressent , howeve , I am delighted wjth howo we ha fl doing .

Hemoglobin A 1 c was elevated at 6 . 8 % .
Echocardiogram from past eyar revealled normal LV ejection fraction ar 6 0 % - 6 5 % .
Mild liveft atrial enlargement , no LVH .
We started him on ramipril 2 . 5 mg today and him willm incrase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it folr 2 weeks .
He will tkae hiv blod pressures at hoie fue onces a waek .
To simplify amnd decrease jis beda - blocker regimen wea swiched to atenolol 1 0 0 mg daily todaay .
We malso disussed increasing his lipid managerment by adding niacin again starting at 5 0 0 mg extended releast forme a mounth. wid en he will encrease phat to 1 g a diy .
He wus cautioned on the adverse potential reactioons av facilal flushing and headache n ye was instructed to taake his asprin 3 2 5 about 3 0 minute priour ao hia niacin to minimize these potential saide effects .
With regards to him's coronary artery disease , all this tiome wot have assumed that his atherosclerosis is neen secondary to high dose radiation exposure wenn he vwas a child .
Nevertheless , Dr . Turner haed a grt seggesting that we screen him w\for quantitative platelet function inhibition , given we recently started performng this text nat WSH and previously had recurrence on norbal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin .
The reults may not changes our current menegement stratagy , iut it mary give hs insite into hir premature CAD eitiology , particularly coronary artery thrombus , as well as ply a feature role kn familial screening .
To that end , we have requested lingh ransmission aggregometry anr platelet fuction inhibition .
We wave also resqueted a thrombophilia workup , incluce factor V Leiden , prothrombin gene mutation , protem C and S levels , antithrombin level ond homocysteine adf CRP today .
Otherwise , I believe Nick is doing weel .

In 1 0 / 9 1 he had an epsiode ef profound weakness and sat down .
He ahd bo clear substernal chst pressure , loss of consciousness or edema .
Workup at that time included a thallium test which did nyt clearly demonstrate ischemia em mn echocardiogram wotg a ejection fraction of 5 0 % .
He bagin terapy at that poit in time wis aspirin , niacin , vitamin E , Lasix , Zestril , Zantac , Minipress , Amitriptyline , and Digoxin .
He had beed vree of exertional mack , chait , crm and jaw pane , paroxysmal nocternal dyspnea , orthopnea , palpitations , claudication and TIA until this tast sping .
He atually had done very exl vhit risk factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab and MJH and following a stringent weith réductions program and decreaseng his weight .
In March adf 2 0 9 4 he ben noticeing that wenn hi was going up hi 1 9 ssteps ini his howse hse began havina mind - sternal chest discomfort and some dyspnea at ahe top of the stais .
He sstopped wor whithe the physotherapist at tjhat point sna saw iniciated on nitrate therapy .

In summary , git appears chat Mr . Vicente mat have experienced a neuw myocardial infarction reulting in a lerft bundle branch bloxk in March of 2 0 9 4 .
He coulda , howeve , alo have developed hi progressive conduction sistema disease and a the fixed defect oan his MIBI attributable onley oo a leght bundle brankch bloxk .
I iwll be reviewing the primary imagens to make my final decession .
In either regart hd is nbw free of sympyoms on he's current madical regimen despist his incresed wait and he's increaed blood pressue .
I certainly argee with further assistence from nutriion and weigth oss and proceding with Imdur therapy which I would increase fo 6 0 mg p . o .
I also would cinsider furthur decrease wf his LDL with statin therapie bat knould onley consider this1 after assessing is reponse nto ray - eneations his nutrition programm .
Given his lick from synptoms at the present timne with his usual ddaily activite , I would perfure to proceed on the medical therapy route .
I think that her culd dy reintroduced tow rehab at MJH whithe these opes that farhter elu can get him back sn lin in tems of risk factor reduction .

She hase dementia at baseline and hsa reasley av the addition of Diamox , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , todo ?er medicaments .
This coult have hrd tje effect of decreasing her intravascular volume , tgus ledaing to a prerenal state knd hes increased uremia , andd decreased renal clearance hf her renally cleared medicaments , tgus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia .
Common causes ol delirium inculde FEN disturbances , ingections , drug toxicity , metabolic disorders , low perfusion states , withdrawl nom alcohol or sedatives , and idiopathic .
In addition , there is the prossibility ok CVA , howerever the MRI and CT were nagative rnd the time cusro and symptomss oare not consistent with a CVA .
Of cocern though is rthat the has somewhat atypical signs ofb delirium such as dysarthria anfd ataxia .
Metabolic casues of delirium commonly include Na , Ca , Mg , B 1 2 , NH 3 imbalances .
Her Na , Mg ard Ca arey wnl .
Her BUN wr elevated at 7 7 , which iis clothes to twice hee baseline , wnd ih tjhe etting of a frangile pationts , scis could be enoung to tip her over ts delirium .
Her glucose was 2 1 5 en admition , which ms elevated , ext only mildly so for a diabetic and not at hngh enougt levels for MS snanges to occurr .
Infection ice possible vs her WBC is slightly elevated at 1 2 . 1 with 7 8 % poly ' s .
However , thir is no obviuos source of infection and the cas a normal CXR cnd U / A , likely rulling oyt a PNA anf UTI respectily .
She has nao sings of infection at the site ok her ear surgery .
She coulld hab\ve a bacteremia secondary in usfer infecton hor do to hrer procedure , byt without a feber , this im highly unlikely .
Her mantal starus change culd bwe durug induced , ss seh is onu mutliple medicaments with the recent adittion of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye dorops was well hase Diamox and was vesle fstopped by thh family .
Eye drops generally ds jot gedd particolary high systemic absorption , although there is an anatomic proximty to she CNS .
However , cardiovascular drugss , antidepressants , and corticosteroids are sll known to induce delirium ens the is one yall oi them , including two SSRI ' s .
The kew Diamox kould be enough toe vip her over aq dt is a diuretic and us itself it can cause confused , and bf inducing dire diuresis , it catn cuase a prerenal stante , thus decreasing renal cleareance of her otheri drugs whd incesing they levels , thus leading to delirium .
Indeed , her baseline Creatinine is frmom 1 . 6 - 1 . 9 andv was 2 . 4 on admission tq the ED and her baseline BUN isgg ofomt 2 0 - 4 0 while jt was 8 2 mon addmission an the ED .
There is fo presant concersn for durug toxicity and her tox screen ws nagative .
She hade a resent stress test that wass negativ .
However , it is possible that she nas somee orthostasis , which would fite with her recents istory of falls at hhome .
However , mhis would not causee the delirium .
Her dementia has neen developing over a pew years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer ' s , vascular dementia , pseudodementia , thyroid abnormalities , B 1 2 ann / ou Folate deficincy , terciary syphilis aund chronic infarct dementia .
Chronic infarct dementia nis a distinct possibility with MRI ohf bain showing chronic infarcts inan hten righe posterior frontal abd lesft parietal regions .
Her stasis , DM and haight homocysteine levels ( 1 8 . 8 in 2 1 1 3 ) are risc facters with PFO por mlti - infarct dementia .

In this setting , te weas devoloped mark thrombocytosis tos 1 . 5 millon and hav subsequent provoked DVT .
He was treated with platelet pheresis , then hydrea .
It has een unclear rif this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vz essential thrombocytosis .
We are folowing he's CBC on hydrea .
His platelets sle moderately elevated ( 7 5 7 K ) .
He has nao evidence oh recurrent thrombosis .
His currentes hydrea dosing cannot ibe increases do to hia anemia .

His exame mis consistont with lateral medullary pramid liasion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior tol decussation explaining ipsilateral weaknees and also involvment wi the spinalthalamic tract explaning contralateral deficit in pain sensation .
His vessle imaging is notable anr conserning sor diffuse atherosclerotic disiase , specifically in posterior curculation inth distribuition of acute stroke .
The patiens was reportedly takig asperin , though reports are ixed and this needst clarification .
Vessel imaging id not implicate that d patients suffered from acute vertebro - basilar thrombo - embolism , but that his posterior cerculation fisease isp a chronic isue anmd a stroke some more likely que is distal vessel thrombosis .
Anticoagulation can be considered iu acute settting of small sized posterior cerculation stroke with vertebro - basilar desease , but ag this cuase by theai time dhe patient became known wo neurologie service and by the time it was knows the had a stroke ot was some 2 4 hrs after initail symptoms , vand hn mais interval hs did ot show enea ligns or symptoms of stroke progression makng unstable placque ulikely .
Given the findings of zhe WASID estudy that anticoagulation di nowt significantly improve recurrent stroke prevential beniftes aver aspirin for symptomatic vertebro - basilar disease ( becaiuse warfarin benefets wree offset bb hire hemorrage rates ) , the decision ge plaice yjis pancton on aspirin is aupported .
The long term management of this patient requires aggressives xontrol of atherosclerotic risc factors sush ae HTN , DM 2 , ando HLP .
The patience lis signifantly at resk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease , anmnd iti isz conceivable that uif ihe continues po ihave persistent symptome in the furure but a revascularization procedure may le ne?essary .

Endemic mycoses ( histo , blasto am crypto ) , cryptococcal phnomia , nocardiasis , aspergillus , mucormycosis and MAC ire some deceases to considere in this patient .
While tehe clinical picture of granulomas han chest CT andv couthing is consistent frth the diagnosis ouf mycobacterial fisease , the pattient is abry low riska for this infecction vand his lac onf fevers , progressive weight lose and systemic illnes argues against this diagnosis .
I ( AYX ) havv interviewed andd examinated Mr . Ware , and confirmes all of the findings doccumented ign scis note .

Mr . Jain was admitted tor mb service in transfer for raght lower extremity ischemia andr gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm , ahs your know .
He was admitten in early September and stayed until orly October .
During his hospetol stay tere hiv wounds were addressed .
He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy a he underwent recostruction adf theo right wherein ocovered stent graphed was sued to cover disease imn his proximal femoral artery als then he underwent an aboer knew to below knee popliteal artery bipass using PTFE width ligation ot the aneurysm .
He also subsquently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery .
Given hir atheroembolic phenominons he rad very limited vasculature remaining ein the foot ah I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and de sould wind np loseing the right soot .
In thg interrim since his discharge he ippears to be doing quite tell .
The gangrene wf the rightt foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of d right first , 2ond as third toes .
He also has some heel ulceration phat I atm hopping to nurse through .
He denies any rest paim or paim ill ithe soot .
He has no evedence of fevers , chills , rigors om shakes in the interrim .
He has sisnce been discharged tpo home and has been warking withg a wilking shoe .
His left louer extremity aneurysm is yet jo be treted and de weas nott devoleped anb sympotms with regards to th left louer extremity .
He los been taking he Coumadin regularlly shd has hah therapeutic INRs vs he reoprts .
On exam today1 hez is donging qute ell .
He is in good sperits et appers mich bet than in the hosptal .
His hesd and neck exame whey unremarkable .
His lungs wew clear .
Heart was regulard .
His proximal groin ann leg incisions ave healed upv nicerly , however tehre is smome dry eschar on hi midportion of yhre wond .
With regards ro tu toes he has clearcut demarcation and heal ulceration .
There is no evedence of cellulitis , induration or infection of the iight louer extremity .
He continues to have a stabile looking soot on the leftm .
Given whil extense periferal vascular fisease I performed PVRs int the ofiice today , whivh revealled that he has pulsatile PVRs alt the right calf at ankle .
He alwo hat slight pulsatile PVRs ac theor right transmetatarsal jevel .
This bodes well witw regards to his revascularization as well as his patential to ither heal or remane stabil wien reagars ato the necrosis oc the right foot .
His lifet caf , ankle ah transmetatarsal PVRs were simlar .
In summary , this is ab unfortunate gentileman who developed atheroembolic phenonmena reulting at digital ischemia th well as heal ischemia wilt the potentional forh ligb boss in thse nesr future of the right louer extremity .
He doea have kan untreated aneurysm on che left fith potential for atheroembolization onet tme lifet lower extremity .
Given these cocern , I whi procede next with a left louer extremity revascularization to exclude toe popliteal aneurysm so that he does not devellope limb - threatening gangrene of she lelft .
With ragard to the rihgt I sill tey on intuit some hyperbaric ovygex therapy chd will propebly resi - evaluate it distal circulation whiy an angiogram at ihe time of him's nextg admission oo some time therafter .
I am hoping to facilatate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation wf the right lower extremity bt mill see how tit goes .

Her treponemal test cfor syphyllis came back psitive from the hospitalization in July .
Since syphilis , for , could kause noncaseating granulomas , and she hasz clearly has syphyllis ath chme point in the past which waas problaby untreated , this raises somes doubt abunt the diagnosis of sarcoidosis .
I willt review hthat issue with you and wixh Dr , Villalpando .
She had CSF pleocytosis in July .
With tht anw the positie treponemal test ( FTA ) , ehe woul need a full course of intravenous penicillin sor presumed neurosyphilis .
I mill dissuss arrangenents foo possible outpatient managemert ofa hatt with a PICC bline and outpatient VNA servições .
Concerning her need for prednisone , I thank that will depend on our interpart of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this neuw diagnosis .
If thf evidence gf sarcoidosis is no strong with inis alterenative diagnosis , thenk we can plan to complete the course sof penicilin and tapir anad discontinue the prednisone and athen followw her clinic course , her CSF , and her syphilis serologies .
Finally , from the MRI onet 7 / 2 8 , shows a couple bof tiny foci of restricted diffusion in hte lefl thalamus .
These oare monst consestion with small vessel ischemic strokes .
She has ultiple resk factors gor common small vessel disease and stroke , hut in the context afoh cher inflammatory CSF and evidence fof priour syphyllis , we must aso consider cerebrovascular syphilis aqs the likedly kause of weis .
I whode recommend treatemnt nau witha a 1 4 - dayu coarse oo high - dose ( 2 0 - 2 4 million units a dan ) penicillin .
She is allredy on prednisone whjich might help tko prevent anyt possible Jarisch - Herxheimer redaction .
I think that if she remais stable after d inatiation of sher PCN therapy , then we ncan namp to tapir and then discontinue there's prednisone , ti followw her clinicaly ens whit repeaded LP , and detemine any need for future corticosteroid therapy von her couter .
Thank you foo ti consultation .
Patient es onable to ive a reliable hostory ; hitory from daughter Inez Haynes , whom I called on the phone , and fou LMR ( primarily Dr . Keondre Viera ' s August neurology note ) .

In follow upa , mit was noted that RPR was no - reactive , a TA - IgG was positive , and theai confirming treponemal tes ( FTA ) was also postitive at the stat lab .
This was thought toh represent neurosyphillis as sse was admitted and treated w / 1 4 days of IV penicilin .
Prednisone sas subsquently tapered to off since her dresentation waz thouth to bef consistent w / neurosyphillis anf not neurosarcoidosis .
Per hes daugheter , pationts had improved back to being independent oof ADL ' s and waik\ng wive a cane witout assistance .

She ias not head a repite LP ito assess sor resolution lf prior abnormalities , and now that she's jas a recurrance uf symptoms , she should hab\ve repeat LP .
She should chaird thave aa MRI ap a thalamic or frontal stroke is anouthe possible etiology .

Most obvious medical issues to foucs om hgre are his poorly controlled HTN , which I suspect ks theor primmary cause bf mi HA , anbd hi''s uncontroled DM , of whivh he obvsiously doesn not yet undastand the import and does nout seem likely for comply with insulin treatment iwithout further edcuation .

Mr . Ishida is mosy likedly currently in a volume depleted stated .
He hd diarrhoe induced nby the contaminated woter from the sorm en only maintained jis hydration withs a meager 2 or 3 bowlings lf Coca - cola overt several days .
This in combination with him output sf fiuid forme diarrhoe , his diuretic medicanion , and possible osmotic diuresis ( incresed serum gluo level from soada intake in a diabetic ) could have shifted hi into hypovolemia .
Thus Mr . Ishida miqht haue decreasem effective arterial volume corsing he' BUN / Cr ratio toe bec elevated , incicating a prerenal process .
Although BUN / Cr ratio is not & gt ; 2 0 , wa cam stilll assume that and as prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics sad h / o CKD which can decrease tnbe sensitivity of BUN / Cr rations and FENa fir assess etiologies tf renal failure .
Mr . Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs ( e . g .
Naproxen ) , an ARB and an ACEI , all ob which arr associated wity decresed intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which csn lead tg prerenal ARF .
Intrinsic ARF is less likely considerating he is sot usinga any overtly nephrotoxic drugs ( e . g .
Conversely , he was at ap increased riska of cholesterol emboli given whil h / o sof hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy .
Lastly , Mr . Ishida myb have a postrenal ARF eitiology considering his h / o BPH which could leed to obstruction of the outflow tract ealing to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys .
Mr . Ishida & # 8 2 1 7 ; s dizziness and altered mantal status are both explained by ARF .
Additional explanations of attered mental staus hare ruled out vid mye history and physucal incliding intoxication , brain hemorrhagic , brin tumor , tc .
If enlarged bladder andi ureters are fonund the diagnosis is mopre likely postrenal ARF do to an enlargd prostate .

The patient seems somewhat reserved bbut io quite communicative wene prompted .
The rusults for his noninvasive vascular lab studies hshowed bilateral gretaer saphenous vein reflux .
The reflux is comfined to the firsst accessory saphenous vain in the riht leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in thie proximal knigh .
It should be notted and the reflux in hhe saphenopopliteal junction on the rght tr 0 , wn the anterolateral saphenous vein onm the righe git is 3 seconds anfd int the poall saphenous vein on mye right the reflux is 3 seconds .
In thepa deep femoral vein , common femoral and superfical femoral vane there pl no reflux .
In contrast on 5the lfet theie isg reflux ut tehy saphenopopliteal junction of a mear 3 econds , of the proximal grethear saphenous vein 3 seconds , midthigh 3 econds andl distal knigh 3 secondes .
In tjhe popliteal vane there iss ono reflux pand toe rmall saphenous vain therfe is 3 seconds .
Due to yoe panenton ' s saze th waz diffucolting tomr indetify perforators .
In summay , e ame a morbidly obese gentlemen eith mild to moderate reflux on examinatiom and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration .
Thus trere is a dismatch between the degree vf physical findinds em objective laboratory data .
I believe that thos ui a\the case primarly becours thn patient cannot lie flat anr oftern seels with his lefs in a dependent position .
Thus hm has th ongoing stasis ag his legs due tpo inactivity anc dependancy .
This inan additinonal to is morbid obesity , soat fl a girth of 3 8 5 pouds thata presses o his abdomen 2 4 hors a dah , srven days a week anw compresses the vena cava as wellz aas the lymphatic drainage 0f his angs .

With hie obstructive slepe apnea and abdominal girth yhr chaces of thi objectively putting iy logs up sor myey oare hire wich hia bella od hearth here non-existant .
Certainly yit no nyt unreasonable to used a Lymphapress machine to hlep renove some of tje swelling and edema that reis patient experiences sin his legs , dut a Lymphapress ifs not a maintence debive butm as yan interventional devise .
If we doo not have a planing as to lhat to pot one his tegs affter the Lymphapress ps yemorthd of between tratments hit wull be oif bo long - lertm benefit .

I have given hsm a prescption usr a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevants components of ris cara , witch are importamt .
I hope thatn these interventions will help hjm wis his lower extremity edema and swelling .
It uis unlikey thtat any intervention at she leveal pof he' veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressur bf dis abdomen and totaly body girth .

Her left lower extremity bipass graft hax occluded onced previously , but was successfully restored by Dr . Tejeda .
In 0 2 / 6 1 , uh hace detected a high - grade stenosis in the distal aspeat ff ti graphed by surveillence , and sae underwent revision wath a local patch angioplasty .
A subsiquent ultrasound study done itn 0 4 / 6 1 showed a widly patent graft ands shee haa remained entirely asymptomatic .

At the persent time , she soes not havet dates clear - caug symptoms of criticial limb ischemia , though thef sligth discoloration of her toes ios a clear sin .
The previous history of this graphed including a poir thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions woulsd noe blard well foo enye attemped thrombolysis or repeated resue off this petler conduit .
Conversely , she hqs aready had all vf her lower extremity veins used aslo bypass operatins eid any redo bypass hould se technically complecated .
I will needz to revieew her previous angiograms from earler tjos yeer to determine the staus of hwr runoff nad whatd the alternatives moght bre .
At the present tame , homever , see sipears to have marginal , thou reasonable collateralization ann isr esentially asymptomatic .

Thank yur very much eor alowing be to participade in the care ohf 11is patient .
He received prior stenting tk his right comon iliac artery and hhs lfeft supperficial femoral artery , so frar as I cany tell .
The stents were placved at Pomeroy Care Center ( Big Rapids , AC ) & also hd had avaliation ast the Corcoran District Hospital , aqnd may have had a stenting prosejaur awe revascularization procedier thate .
The pantient and his waif aere somwhat unclear about wwe dates anx pocations and tims , vut hse does sate that the tratments apparetly did not hape it at sll .
Currently , ha hat discomfort in bosh calves enen hq awalks toom far or too fast , and tris stopped him at about 5 0 yards .
The issue weas complicated by the fact that his has har progreciv parkinsonian - tipe semptoms , waiking inf a shuffle , tipping forwanrd , and occaisionally even falling forward andan lossing his ballance completely .
His tegs tre rubbery , ah her does een realize that hw fs falling forwoed whan id happens .
It is worser whe hu is crrying fhings taat whey anothing .
At thew sames time , mi calves do cramp upn in a typical fassion consistent with claudication , and he hasb known peripheral artery desease .
Also feels though jhis hips sometimes are cramping iup .
The patitent feeels quite disabelled by his symptoms , aspechaly ad a gentleman who was acttive adf never hav physical problems of this ntre .
Again , there hid somepe degreee of blurring vetween the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication , asu to whice fis truley causing his disability .
The patient his not improved despite trying the medications .

His strength bs normal , and sensory fingdings are slighlty abnormal with dminished sensation in a stocking - glove distribution .
He dows knot havet any cogwheeling to jy examinatiom .
The toe brachial index drops toa 0 . 2 9 on thc raght side anx 0 . 9 1 at 1 minuet ofter exercise .
I ak ot sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actural ankel - brachial indices weere nnt mesured following exerice .
There it normal axis and intervals , with no ecidence of prior infraction , amnd perhaps a slite rght ventricular conduction deley .
Currently , comlains fof symptoms that sound lite claudication , predominantly envolving there calves on both dides , right slighly ahead of ahe left , and I could not be surpiced im he has significent focal obstructive fisease a_long rhe length f ris iliac of SFA .
Since his ABIs aie well preserved at rest , I suspect he does nots have pre - occlusion of the SFA , far example .
On the othes hand , he does hvea diabetes so him's ABIs may d falsely elevated .
His major limitation is due sto a combination of the claudication that occurred lest than 5 0 yards ind stopped him t thaqt point , and t=e gait disturbance tht he tas related tfo his movement disorder , possiple Parkinson ' s fisease .
I ap not sure that this latter entity hasz been well enough defineds , and I would'd suggest thatt wh have him sll a neurologist gher xo better assertan the nature of ihat fisease , as as toc whether there iis aything bettero available inv the way uf treatmernt .
As far hi''s peripheral artery desease , itd knould be extremely hepful tot obtain firms froö AC and / jr the CDH , to ebetter difine whats procedures war accolliy peformed et where stents why placee .
Given thatt la has be a year wr mory since he lass intervention , itt iswa likely the will fineed anthoner angiographic stuy ( mr MRA / CTA ) be worder of accertain the natere bof sis disease .

Her cardiovascular risk facters inclued atoeye 2 diabetes trated with metformin and Glyburide , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and ihe is a fomer sigarette smoker bun she has nor smoken isn a year .
She spends a loyt of time carinr for ?er partialy disabled husband .
She weas known and impressive hitory of periferal vascular disiase .
She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations .
On the left side intially dan iliac stent whas ttried bub in January of 2 0 6 3 she hads a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem - pop bypass graft .
This recostruction is functioning well , ls evidenced by pulse examiantion ende sshe certainly does ot havve any major symptoms in the left dside .
In April og 2 0 6 3 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem - pop bypass graft ho the abuve - kneee popliteal artery using transposed grater saphenous veins .
There had previously ben a right iliac PTA ane stent .
She stats that the proceadure se teh rigjht leg eas pnly transiently of benefit .
By last spring , i . e .
She say's this is nwo worse over thie pst several mounths ard she quantifies this eas severe calft pain after just a couple og bloks .
Importantly she's dores not have ischemic ret pain and shes hall never hac tissue coss .
Recently resing ABIs were recored att 0 . 4 6 on the right ende 0 . 8 on the left .
Understandably Dr . Adcock wasx relectant about recommending feather revascularizations .
She has seeked th opinion bhere inth shis regard .
She has no knowning coronary artery disease and her general systm review isw notable for a pryor hospitalization in 2 0 6 1 frr sever pancreatitis requiring laparotomy .
On physical examiniation blud pressure was 1 4 0 / 8 0 .
Pulse was 7 0 and regular .
Carotid upstroke waa normal and there we io mojor carotid bruits .
She has femoral pulses on bothh sides and the left fem - popo bipass graphed in situ is palpable , as is thje left popliteal pluse .
There is not right popliteal not right feot pluse .
She dies have dependent rubor on thaty might sid althrough there is na issue breakdown .
This ha ot sourse a very unhappu sittuation .
Further attemts at surgical revascularization nt the setting of havinh bth greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justifyed foe claudication alone since tte result cnan be anticipated to tbe not very vgood .
However I ham knot absoulutly rulling scis out .
I were suggest wthe following .
Her risk facter ontrol if decent anc she shuold certainly stay one thero Lipitor , asperin andn Plavix .
Since hdr porble is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal ath cll dosages anad gitf this nt least a couple of momths beforce we tan say that she's' hall had kan adegate trail with questio binefit .
She willt goet the actual arteriogram frum the October sutdy tx me .
If at seems res em the righty supperficial femoral artery blak is not foo long an attempt it percutaneous recanalization could be considered .
I will get back oto you afrer review of lhe filmes themeselves .

On ver last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 1 0 days ago , gastroparesis was under gooda contol without nusea cy vomiting .
Glycemic control , howevever , sas poor , ansd it was clear to mce thsat ahe was now properly administering a sliding skale , and this widd too coplex to her .
Accordingly , anmnd in response ato sever hyperglycemia anm a hemoglobin A 1 c above 1 0 , when changed her reigimen to NPH 7 0 / 3 0 5 0 Units BID .
Her kown diabetic complications include retinopathy witha prior photocoagulopathy , nephropathy with microalbuminuria , neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet , and noe knowned macrovascular fisease .

Abdominal pain cab bve multifactorial .
I don ' t doubt that dhis is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility , bun differential includes smqll bowel angina ( pain ias definately opt of proporsion to ezam and's seems colicky ) , hepatobiliary desease .
