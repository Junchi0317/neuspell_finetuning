About a week ago he slipped on the driveway at home and sustained an injury to his left ankle . 
He was seen at Tri - City Hospital and was told he had a fracture . 
He was placed in an air splint and advised to be partial weight bearing , and he is using a cane . 
He is here for routine follow - up . 
Past medical history is notable for no ankle injuries previously . 
He has a history of diabetes and sleep apnea . 
He takes Prozac , Cardizem , Glucophage and Amaryl . 
He is also followed by Dr . Harold Nutter for an arrhythmia . 
He does not smoke . 
He drinks minimally . 
He is a set designer at Columbia Pictures . 
On examination today he has slight tenderness of the left ankle about four fingerbreadths above the malleolus . 
The malleolus is non - tender medially or laterally with no ligamentous tenderness either . 
Dorsal flexion and plantar flexion is without pain . 
There is no significant swelling . 
There are no some skin changes with some small abrasions proximally . 
There is no fibular tenderness proximally . 
No anterior pain is noted . 
No hindfoot , midfoot or forefoot tenderness is noted . 
I would like him to use a tube sock with his air cast . 
He is using a cane for ambulation . 
His x - rays do not show a notable fracture pattern today , and we will await the Radiology opinion . 
I would like him to stay in the air splint with the sock . 
I will see him back in six weeks for review at the Boxborough office .

Normocephalic and atraumatic . 
The heart has a regular rate and rhythm . 
The abdomen is soft . 
He has left lower quadrant tenderness . 
The neurologic examination is non - focal . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : As you already know , Mr . Valdez who demonstrates a history of difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance , as well as increased early morning awakenings , has noted an exacerbation of these sleep difficulties , occurring in temporal association with his loss of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year . 
He is now placed in the unfortunate situation of being a single parent to a 1 5 - year - old son and a 1 0 - year - old daughter and describes a modification of his current employment duties of a set designer . 
In particular , Mr . Valdez describes undergoing on frequent international travelling which has bee markedly curtailed as he is tending to his family situation closer to home . 
He described a history of intermittent snoring symptomatology but is unaware of specific nocturnal respiratory pauses . 
He is unaware of a " restless " lower limb sensory complaints which may impact on his ability to initiate or reinitiate sleep . 
He denies a history of a " night owl " personality or circadian rhythm dysfunction which may have played a role with respect to nocturnal sleep disruptions or sleep difficulties . 
He denies a history of paroxysmal abnormal disturbances or associated narcoleptic symptoms . 
Mr . Valdez underwent an initial formal polysomnographic evaluation at the center for sleep diagnostics at Holy Cross on 1 1 / 2 6 / 0 5 , during which time he was noted to demonstrate a respiratory disturbance index of 8 1 / hour , particularly exacerbated in the supine position and characterized predominantly by hypopneas , with equal distribution during non - REM and stage REM sleep and with associated O 2 desaturation Nadir of 8 8 % The respiratory disturbances were predominantly obstructive or mixed hypopneas . 
In addition , loud snoring was noted . 
There was evidence of a sleep efficiency of 8 8 % and a short sleep onset latency of 4 minutes . 
There was a predominance of " light " non - REM stages I - II sleep , and a concomitant inability to achieve significant " slow - wave " or stage REM sleep . 
There was also " alpha intrusions and alpha delta sleep " evident during the initial sleep study . 
In addition premature ventricular contractions were noted . 
The patient underwent a CPAP titration on 0 1 / 1 5 / 0 6 , also at the Tenacre Foundation Nursing Home in Boxborough , during which time there was a marked reduction in the frequency of hypopneas ( respiratory disturbance index equals 2 / hour ) with CPAP titrations between 4 - 6 cm . 
Sleep efficiency improved to 9 1 % , a short sleep onset latency was also noted ( 3 minutes ) . 
There was once again an increased predominance of " light " non - REM stage I - II sleep , with concomitant inability to achieve sustained " slow wave sleep " . 
Since his initial trial of nocturnal CPAP titration ( at 6 cm of water pressure ) and with various CPAP mask modifications ( including CPAP nasal face mask and a Mallinckrodt " Breeze " supportive head gear with " nasal pillows " . 
The patient describes associated claustrophobic symptomatology , relative difficulties with sustained nocturnal home CPAP use , and difficulties with regards to CPAP to being and complications by the bulkiness of the CPAP machine in general . 
As a result , he has not utilized nocturnal CPAP therapy for a period of time , although he still maintains the CPAP equipment in his house . 
Of particular note , and exacerbation of the past year , the patient demonstrates increased early morning awakenings ( averaging 2 - 4 in number ) with typical awakenings occurring approximately two hours after sleep initiation at 9 : 3 0 p . m . ( the patient describes one awakening at 1 1 : 3 0 p . m . and the second awakening at 1 1 : 4 5 a . m . , of unclear causative etiology ) . 
The patient then might awaken at 3 a . m . and be " ready for the day " . 
If he is able to reinitiate sleep thereafter , the patient may demonstrate additional two early morning awakenings after a final awakening at 6 a . m . 
The patient is noted to have a history of mixed systemic conditions including diabetes , coronary artery disease , depressive disorder , as well as a relatively stable gastrointestinal condition , with no upper GI evidence of gastroparesis . 
Provigil 2 0 0 mg p . o . 
Lithium . 
Valproate .

ALLERGIES / ADVERSE REACTIONS : The patient describes an enhancement to suicidal tendencies in association with prior Prozac usage . 
SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient denies active tobacco or alcoholic beverage usage . 
He has lost 1 5 - 2 0 pounds over the past several years . 
His current weight is 1 9 5 pounds . 
He is desirous of losing some additional weight with regards to more regular exercise , but his hectic social situation makes this somewhat difficult at the present time . 
On examination , the patient demonstrates a blood pressure of 1 4 6 / 8 8 , ( seated , left arm ) , respiratory rate 1 6 . 
HEENT EXAMINATION : Borderline small posterior oropharyngeal aperture , with slightly increased redundant tissue evident posteriorly and a slightly elongated uvula noted . 
The patient appears awake , alert , with speech clear and fluent and receptive language function essentially intact . 
He is presently wearing dental braces . 
No obvious cranial nerve deficits are appreciated . 
No focal , sensory , motor or neurologic deficits are noted . 
No significant appendicular dystaxias or dysmetrias are currently in evidence . 
The routine gait appears to be normal based , without evidence of significant gait dystaxias . 
No current clinical ictal manifestations are present . 
No acute evidence of " micro - sleeps " are noted . 
Sleep stage / arrousal dysfunction ( 7 8 0 . 5 6 ) : Manifested by subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep , increased daytime fatigue and alternating hypersomnia , and recurrent polysomnographic evidence of " lightened " sleep pattern , with increased predominance of non - REM stages 1 - 2 sleep , and with the presence of " alpha " intrusions and " alpha delta " component to deeper sleep . 
These latter EEG findings have been described in association with subjective complaints of nonrestorative sleep , as well as clinical setting of chronic pain related complaints , depressive or anxiety disorder or intercurrent psychotropics agents used ( but more usually associated with benzodiazepine or barbituate usage ) . 
Sleep disordered breathing : As evidenced during prior polysomnographic evaluations , mostly of obstructive and or mixed hypopnea . 
The patient appears largely refractory to a trial of CPAP therapy , particularly in so far as he demonstrates associated claustrophobic symptoms in association with it ' s usage , despite relatively modest CPAP water pressures ( 6 cm ) . 
In addition , he has tried various nasal CPAP face mask , including the Mallinckrodt " Breeze " supportive head gear with " nasal pillows " and with limited success . 
One might consider repeating a polysomnographic evaluation in the future , and if so , utilizing a potential trial of BIPAP titration , which may help to improve claustrophobic symptoms , but the patient will still be left with the issues referable to " tangled tubing at night " and issues referable to nasal face mask usage , as noted above . 
While there would logically be a relationship between his current sleep exacerbations and the recent death of his wife from pancreatic cancer last year , there may also be evidence of other nocturnal sleep disturbances for which a repeat polysomnographic evaluation ; i . e . 
In the short course , in so far as the patient describes himself as being exceedingly tired , and unable to perform the routine daily tasks of work and managing a family in the absence of his deceased wife , I have suggested initiation of PRN Zolpidem tartrate therapy , 5 mg tablets , utilizing one to two tablets p . o . 
PRN for difficulties of sleep reinitiation and maintenance . 
The patient is advised to take Zolpidem tartrate therapy no more than 2 - 3 times per week , in an effort to avoid any issues of physiologic dependency . 
Pending his clinical response of his Zolpidem tartrate therapy , I then might seek direct treatment for his sleep disordered breathing issues which may include a repeat sleep study with potential trial of BIPAP therapy ( in an effort to modify or attenuate claustrophobic symptoms ) . 
If he proves poorly responsive to trial of BIPAP therapy however , I might consider supplemental O 2 therapy at night and , with this in mind a follow up sleep study should have associated end - tidal CO 2 monitoring as well . 
In the meantime , the patient was advised to contact the sleep disorders clinic for any acute sleep related concerns in the interim . 
The patient may also benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches with regards to sleep reinitiation such as hypnotherapy , but I will hold off on these strategies pending follow up sleep disorders clinic evaluation ( in approximately four months time ) . 
Once again , thank you again for allowing me to share in the medical care of Mr . Harlan Valdez . 
I hope this letter finds you well . 
This CP was minimal , but the weakness made him pull over . 
He had a repeat of these symptoms day of admission . 
His EKG c / w 2 / 2 1 0 7 showed flattened T - wave in V 2 and TWI in V 3 and flattened T - waves in I , aVL . 
His trop was negative , but MB index was elevated . 
Due to T - wave flattening , history and elevated index it was decided to start on heparin and ASA and take to cath lab . 
Cath showed right dominant system with prox Cx 4 0 % , LAD clear , RCA prox 7 0 - 8 0 % lesion and ostial PDA 9 0 % . 
During final dye injection , pt had VF arrest and 2 shocks . 
Pt regained puls and was in AF ( new ) with RVR . 
Pt was started on amio . 
Pt then began to experience discomfort in the RVR and it was decided to intervene . 
POBA was done to ostial PDA . 
A first no - eluting stent was placed in prox RCA and pt had dissection and thus 2 cd stent was placed . 
On admission to CCU , pt still in AF with RVR ( 1 2 0 ' s ) . 
He was on amio drip , BB , loaded on plavix , ASA , lipitor , integrilin and was placed on Avandia study . 
His complaint of some mild chest pain ( not same as anginal pain day before ) thought to be from defibrillation . 
Rhythm - on night of admission patient was started on an esmolol drip as well as amio bloused and rhythm converted to NSR . 
Esmolol drip as well as amio was stopped and BB was escalated and patient has remained in NSR . 
He was started on plavix . 
He was on depakote , lithium and remeron as outpt . 
He was seen by psychiatry here . 
He has remained on NPH with RISS .

The patient initially presented to LGH ED with hypoxemic respiratory distress . 
While at the OSH , he received CTX , azithromycin , SC epinephrine , and solumedrol . 
While at the OSH , he became confused and subsequently had an episode of PEA arrest and was intubated . 
He received epinephrine , atropine , magnesium , and bicarb . 
In addition , he had bilateral needle thoracostomies with report of air return on the left , and he subsequently had bilateral chest tubes placed . 
After approximately 1 5 - 2 0 minutes of rescucitation , he had ROSC . 
He received vecuronium and was started on an epi gtt for asthma and a cooling protocol , and was then transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further evaluation . 
Of note , the patient was admitted to LGH in [ * * 1 - 4 * * ] for dyspnea , and was subsequently diagnosed with a CAP and asthma treated with CTX and azithromycin . 
Per his family , he has also had multiple admissions this winter for asthma exacerbations .

EEG [ * * 2 - 2 7 * * ] IMPRESSION : This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the slow and disorganized background of 6 . 5 Hz with bursts of generalized slowing that showed no clear reactivity . 
These findings indicate a severe encephalopathy . 
This may be consistent with the patient ' s history of anoxia ; however , toxic / metabolic disturbances , infection , and medication effects are also among the most frequent causes of encephalopathy . 
No clear epileptiform discharges or seizures were seen . 
There is mild scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine . 
The ventricular lead of a pacemaker is identified . 
No fracture of L 2 through L 5 is identified . 
However , there is a compression fracture of L 1 , with compression of the superior endplate , and a sclerotic fracture line . 
Given the mechanism of fall , if there is acute pain referable to L 1 , then this would be considered an acute finding . 
There is no apparent retropulsion of the posterior margin of L 1 into the spinal canal . 
No other fractures are identified at this time . 
Facet joints are aligned .

Brief Hospital Course : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 3 2 3 4 * * ] is a 3 6 year old gentleman with a PMH signifciant with dilated cardiomyopathy s / p AICD , PE not on anticoagulation , asthma , and HTN admitted to an OSH with dyspnea now the transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] MICU after PEA arrest x 2 . 
TTE with evidence of RV failure to suggest PE . 
LVEF 3 0 % with known dilated cardiomyopathy . 
He was cooled per protocol . 
Initially , his EEG was concerning without evident brain activity . 
On hospital day 3 , there was only comatose activity and his prognosis was guarded . 
However , the patient was able to be weaned off the vent and over the course of the next three days his mental status improved . 
He was alert , oriented to place and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities . 
He became more interactive on transfer to the floor , was initially speaking in spanish and English and not always making sense but then started responding more appropiately and following commands . 
On hospital day 1 1 he had a witnessed grand mal seizure and was given ativan and started on Keppra with neurology consult . 
His mental status was worse for 2 4 hours after the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recent baseline . 
He was somewhat aggitated so his Keppra was switched to Topiramate . 
He had a subsequent seizure on [ * * 3 - 1 8 * * ] with LUE tonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but this resolved spontaneously after 1 - 2 minutes . 
He was contineud on topamax per neuro recommendations . 
OT and PT were consulted and worked with the patient as he will likely require a long rehabilitation course . 
At the time of discharge the patient was alert , oriented ( though not always to date ) , following commands but impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls . 
Neurology notes indicate the patient has the potential toimprove from a neurologic standpoint . 
He also may have recurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan IV or IM and do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return to hospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or he has multiple recurrent seizures or complications such as aspiration . 
The patient was initially treated broadly with vancomycin , cefepime , flagyl , cipro , and oseltamavir . 
He was treated with IV soludemedrol and albuterol MDI . 
He was ventialted according to ARDS - Net protocol . 
On admission , he had two chest tubes placed for pneumothoraces . 
They were removed on hospital day 1 . 
In his first several days , his respiratory status was comprimised by lobar collapse , first of the RUL and then of the RML . 
His extubation was initially limited both by agitation requiring sedation and by requirements for high PEEP to maintain oxygenation . 
His oxygenation was improved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled with seroquel . 
He was extubated on [ * * 3 - 1 * * ] and respiratory status was stable . 
His Asthma was treated with standing and PRN albuterol and ipratriopium and a slow prednisone taper which he l completed on [ * * 2 1 1 5 - 3 - 1 8 * * ] and he was restarted on Advair - patient may require additional nebs on top of his standing advair though his respiratory status has been very stable , without wheezing for the last week . 
He was initially covered with vanc / cefepime and cipro . 
Cipro was eventually discontinued . 
He did not grow any organisms other than yeast in his sputum . 
He completed an 8 day course of Vanco / Cefepime . 
These jerks continued for about one week and then became rare . 
Patient was diuresed with IV lasix in the ED and then transitioned to PO lasix , home dose , on the floor . 
His respiratory status remained stable . 
Also continued on home dose of carvedilol and Lisinopril but ACE downtitrated from 4 0 to 2 0 when had elevated Cr 1 . 9 on [ * * 3 - 1 8 * * ] and slightly low BPs high 9 0 s / 6 0 s . 
BP improved to 1 0 0 s / 6 0 s . 
The patient had no localizing deficits on serial neuro exam . 
He was treated with pain medication including low dose ultram , standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch . 
Calcitonin was tried for pain with compression fracture but this did not seem to help with symptoms so was discontinued . 
Since no new infection was found this was presumed [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] steroids and the leukocytosis improved with prednisone taper . 
WBC 1 2 on day of discharge . 
He should have repeat creatinine and labs on [ * * 3 - 2 2 * * ] to ensure stability .

Brief Hospital Course : 3 8 yo F w / h / o ALL in remission s / p cord transplant in [ * * 1 - 1 3 * * ] , anthracycline - induced cardiomyopathy ( EF 1 5 - 2 0 % [ * * 1 - 1 4 * * ] ) and recurrent nausea and vomiting who presents with 1 week abd pain , acute on chronic renal failure and new hyperbilirubinemia . 
Unclear unifying diagnosis . 
Of note , she had an extensive work up of her chronic abdominal pain in the past with no clear cause . 
Abdominal CT was unrevealing for any obvious source of her pain . 
GI was consulted who recommended a SBFT which did not reveal any significant pathology . 
GI recommended bentyl for antispasmodic effect . 
She was also continued on her home MS contin and IV morphine for breakthrough . 
Her pain persisted as did her [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 4 3 9 4 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] the decision was made to perform a diagnositc paracentesis under ultrasound guidance . 
This revealed 7 7 5 WBCs , but a lymphocytic / monocytic predominance with only 1 % polys making SBP unlikely . 
Fluid was sent for culture which showed no growth and flow cytometry which showed no evidence of ALL recurrence . 
Despite lack of evidence for SBP , she was started on zosyn empirically which was stopped on [ * * 5 - 2 * * ] . 
She continued to have mild - moderate abdominal pain but was able to eat full meals and had BMs . 
She was continued on her home mscontin and morphine IR . 
Pt was maintained on diuresis as above , which was subsequently held in the setting of rising creatinine with improvement in creatinine . 
Torsemide was slowly reintroduced and uptitrated to 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] which caused another bump in creatinine to 3 . 0 , so renal and cardiology were consulted . 
Renal ultrasound was unrevealing . 
She was then taken to the Cath lab and placed on a milrinone / lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU . 
Her volume overload slowly improved and her peripheral edema / ascites slowly improved as well . 
A repeat echo showed improved EF to 4 0 - 4 5 % on the milrinone gtt . 
She was then started on solumedrol 3 0 mg IV due to a concern for GVHD directed towards myocardium . 
After further discussion between cardiology and her oncology team she was also started on cellcept for further management of her GVHD . 
She did well on milrinone and lasix drip , but the drip was stopped when her creatinine bumped to 3 . 0 and it was felt her volume status was near maximization . 
Her milrinone was then discontiued and she was then transferred back to [ * * Hospital 1 3 2 4 2 * * ] for further management of her abdominal pain and GVHD . 
She was continued on torsemide for diuresis with close follow - up with her outpatient cardiologist . 
Of note , she had frequent alarms on telemetry for tachycardia that cardiologist felt was mostly due to artifact ; her beta blocker was uptitrated . 
Repeat TTE prior to discharge showed an EF of 3 5 - 4 0 % . 
She was discharged home on cellcept and prednisone for possible GVHD . 
Renal saw the patient who thought this was likely from overdiuresis ( home torsemide regimen of 2 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] ) in conjunction with her [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] recommended holding diuresis . 
Her Cr subsequently improved , but in the setting of her worsening [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) 4 3 9 4 * * ] and her cardiomyopathy , decision was made to slowly add back diuresis , and eventually she was up titrated to toresemide 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and her [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] was restarted . 
With this , however , her Cr began to climb again to 3 . 0 . 
Given the delicate balance between her renal failure cardiomyopathy , cardiology / renal were consulted . 
Given her depressed EF , her rising Cr was thought to be [ * * 3 - 9 * * ] volume overload . 
She was sent to the cath lab and started on a milrinone / lasix gtt and transfered to the CCU with a goal diuresis of 1 L per day . 
She was actively diuresed on her milrinone and lasix drip with a total net negative of close to 9 L . 
Her Cr then returned to baseline by time of discharge and she was discharged home on torsemide . 
RUQ u / s without cause for pain . 
She was maintained on coumadin 4 mg daily , but anticoagulation was held on day of paracentesis and remained subtherapeutic for several days , so she was maintained on a heparin drip to bridge her to a therapeutic INR [ * * 3 - 1 0 * * ] . 
She was maintained on a decreased dose of coumadin throughout hospital admission with INR within goal between 2 and 3 . 
She was arranged with follow - up at outpatient [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] .

She was readmitted [ * * 2 1 0 7 - 1 - 1 7 * * ] after she was found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with Levo / Flagyl and Vanco . 
Cultures were positive for MRSA . 
Levo and Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA . 
The pt recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on her home O 2 requirement . 
She was getting bridged for her anticoagulation with Lovenox starting [ * * 1 - 1 8 * * ] in preparation for discharge . 
However , she developed severe abdominal pain and a palpable mass in her L abdomen . 
A CT was showed a new large hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and lateral lower abdominal and pelvic wall , without any intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal extent , but with associated mass effect on the lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops . 
Surgery was [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 4 2 2 1 * * ] and suggested no intervention , but monitoring for now . 
HCT dropped 6 points in this setting , but she remained hemodynamically stable with tachycardia which has been present throughout her hospital stay ( 9 5 - 1 1 5 ) .

Fluid - attenuating structure adjacent to the right T 1 1 - 1 2 neural foramen is also unchanged and could be a perineural cyst . 
CT abdomen / pelvis : 1 . 
New large hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and lateral lower abdominal and pelvic wall , without any intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal extent , but with associated mass effect on the lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops . 
Unchanged infectious or inflammatory opacities in the right middle and lower lobes . 
Right inferior epigastric arteriogram demonstrates no extravasation of contrast and successful embolization with Gelfoam until stagnation of flow .

There are no pleural effusions . 
There is no pneumothorax . 
The left subclavian catheter tip overlies the mid SVC . 
Heart size normal . 
Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal . 
No color flow , compressibility , or waveforms are demonstrated within these areas of thrombus . 
She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin . 
She completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin . 
MRSA was found to grow in her sputum so she was continued on a 1 4 day course of vancomycin . 
She originally presented with elevated WBC count and left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of antibiotics . 
Her productive cough improved as well and she remained on her baseline home O 2 of 2 L . 
Approximately 4 days after completion of her 1 4 day course of Vancomycin , the patient developed worsening cough , SOB , and upper respiratory symptoms . 
A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL . 
The patient was started back on Levofloxacin / Flagyl . 
Vancomycin was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2 / 4 bottles with GPC in clusters and chains . 
Additionally , her sputum culture grew out GNRs . 
Levofloxacin was discontinued and Meropenem was started for concern for Pseudomonas given the patient ' s long hospital course . 
Her O 2 sat remained stable 9 3 - 1 0 0 % on 2 L nasal cannula ( which is her baseline ) . 
She was given mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thick sputum . 
Her GNRs in the sputum grew out E . coli . 
Because of the sensitivity profile of the E . coli and the patient ' s allergy to penicillin and cephalosporins , the patient was continued on Meropenem . 
Her GPCs were found to grow out Coag negative Staph . 
Surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coag negative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant . 
Her Vancomycin was discontinued . 
She will continue a 1 4 day course of Meropenem and she was discharged with a PICC to complete this course . 
CT during recent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location of filter and CTA on this admission showed improvement of clot . 
Admission labwork revealed an INR of 7 . 9 . 
Coumadin was thus held and reversed with FFP and vitamin K given her history of GIB on anticoagulation . 
In the interim , therapeutic lovenox injections were initiated , but within days of starting , she developed a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenox injection site . 
Once her hematocrit stabilized , she was started on a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap . 
While [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 9 5 3 3 * * ] her Coumadin with an INR 1 . 2 , she was found to have a large Hct drop and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma . 
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring . 
It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation , the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated . 
In terms of her hypercoagulable workup , it has been negative thus far for hyperhomocysteinemia , Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid antibody . 
Malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and EGD as well as CEA , all of which were within normal limits . 
SPEP revealed hypogammaglobulinemia , but was otherwise unremarkable . 
During her hospital course , she also began to complain of worsening lower extremity pain . 
LENIs were obtained which showed evidence of extensive , completely occlusive , bilateral deep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins to the popliteal veins . 
Radiology felt that these clots were most likely acute to subacute in nature . 
In this setting , hematology / oncology saw the patient again to consider the risks vs benefits of anticoagulation . 
Antithrombin III , prothrombin mutation , Lupus anticoagulation and [ * * Location ( un ) 1 1 6 9 * * ] Venom Viper were sent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability . 
The hematology / oncology team still felt that the risks of coagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that the patient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting of anticoagulation . 
Despite the drop , she remained hemodynamically stable ( has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed ) . 
She received 3 units prbcs , 4 units FFP . 
Her hematocrit then stabilized and once stable , she was restarted on heparin gtt . 
Coumadin was re - initiated and heparin gtt was continued while awaiting her INR to become therapeutic . 
While [ * * Location ( un ) 9 5 3 3 * * ] her Coumadin with an INR 1 . 2 , she was found to have another Hct drop ( 2 5 . 9 - > 2 2 . 2 ) and a CT scan of the abdomen showed a new right - sided rectus hematoma . 
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring . 
She was given 1 unit FFP and 9 units PRBCs between [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 3 9 1 2 5 * * ] until her hematocrit became stable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion . 
It was decided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation , the risks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated . 
She has complained of [ * * 6 - 1 6 * * ] abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stable hematocrits . 
Her pain is most likely [ * * 3 - 1 1 * * ] to the large rectus hematoma that will resolve over time . 
Her Hct remained stable after her anticoagulation was discontinued . 
It was not further evaluated by MRI given its long term stability and also she has metal hardware in place s / p elbow surgery and facial plates . 
It should be followed up with imaging to ensure it remains unchanged in the future . 
During her stay , she developed a tingling , itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on her right buttock over the S 2 , S 3 dermatomal distribution . 
There were no vesicles appreciated . 
She was treated with acyclovir . 
She had no blood in her stools during this admission even while anticoagulated . 
Her stools were guiac - ed multiple times and were found to be guiac negative . 
She was continued on mesalamine . 
She was continued on midodrine .

History of Present Illness : 4 4 yoM PMH ESRD secondary to Brights disease on HD s / p two failed renal transplants , HCV , CHF with EF 2 0 % , AF on coumadin who presented to the ED with a two week history of diffuse abdominal pain with one day of nausea and vomiting [ * * 2 1 1 4 - 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] . 
Two weeks prior to admission the patient began to experience diffuse dull abdominal pain without nausea or vomiting and loose stools 2 - 3 times per day . 
The patient believed this was secondary to fluid overload . 
One week prior to presentation the patient complained of subjective fevers , cough productive of yellow sputum . 
His nephrologist gave him a five - day course of azithromycin . 
The patient had persistent symptoms and was started on levofloxacin by his PCP two days prior to admission . 
The patient had a history of tylenol use 3 g / day for 5 days prior to admission for fever , body aches . 
The day prior to admission the patient began to experience worsened abdominal pain associated with nausea , a few episodes of vomiting , nonbilious / nonbloody , and diarrhea 4 - 5 times per day , watery , nonbloody . 
In the ED the patient was found to be hypotensive with lactate of 5 . 6 and a code sepsis was called . 
He was given Vanco , Flagyl and Zosyn for presumed infection . 
He was given Decadron for presumed adrenal insufficiency . 
He was also given Calcium gluconate , sodium bicarbonate , Insulin and D 5 0 for hyperkalemia .

During admission on [ * * 6 - 1 4 * * ] , cardiology team saw the patient and recommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control ; a pericardial window was not performed because the effusion was determined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related to dehydration and tachycardia . 
Subsequent CT of the torso did not reveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in the right ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastatic disease . 
Considering pericardial and pleural fluid pathology , a subtle gastric or pancreatico / biliary tumor was suspected and the patient was started on gemcitabine / irinotecan .

Chest CT ( [ * * 7 - 1 2 * * ] ) IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Diffuse peribronchovascular opacity with air bronchograms involving the right middle and right lower lobes post thoracentesis . 
Given the rapid evolution of this process , findings likely represent pulmonary edema . 
Pulmonary hemorrhage or multifocal pneumonia is less likely . 
Close interval radiographic follow up recommended . 
Large left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis . 
Minimal pericardial fluid . 
No pneumothorax or reaccumulation of the right pleural effusion . 
CXR ( [ * * 7 - 1 5 * * ] ) : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Unchanged moderate left - sided pleural effusion . 
Patchy opacities at the right lung base have cleared since the prior examination , likely representing pulmonary edema given its rapid improvement ; mild persistent residual pulmonary edema . 
Brief Hospital Course : The patient is a 5 5 y / o woman with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary ( likely discrete gastric or pancreaticobiliary ca ) admitted with tachycardia in the setting of malignant pericardial effusions and uncontrolled pain . 
The dyspnea after her procedure was likely a result of reexpansion edema , which was reflected on her chest X - ray . 
She was initially treated in the intensive care unit with oxygen therapy as well as IV Lasix and closely monitored . 
No infectious etiology was identified . 
It was decided that thoracentesis was not warranted as her pleural effusion was significantly smaller after the procedure . 
Her respiratory distress rapidly improved with diuresis and she was soon back to baseline ( requires home O 2 ) . 
She did not experience significant nausea during hospitalization , but continued to have diarrhea related to her chemotherapy which was treated with Lomotil . 
She was continued on lovenox therapy .

He developed drug rash allergy on his neck and back while in the ED . 
Left foot abscess / cellulitis / drug reaction : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 1 4 6 1 1 * * ] presented to his podiatrist on [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 1 * * ] with two days of nausea , vomiting ( clear , non - bilious , non bloody ) , productive cough ( sputum color not noted ) , fatigue , and pain and redness of his left foot . 
He was found to have a draining wound ( approximately 1 cm in width x 1 cm in depth ) on his left lower leg , just superior to the lateral malleolus with an area of surrounding cellulitis . 
He as admitted to the ED for IV antibiotics and observation . 
In the ED 2 liters of IV fluid , a dose of Vancomycin x 1 ( for cellulitis , first dose [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 2 * * ] ) , and a percocet and transferred to the MICU for further management . 
In the MICU he was treated with his 5 th liter of normal saline . 
Podiatry reported that plain film imaging showed " interval osteolysis adjacent to the fixation screws that is suggestive of infection or interval loosening " . 
Blood and swab cultures were obtained , and a urine culture was negative for growth . 
He was then admitted to the medicine floor for further management . 
On the floor He was continued on Vancomycin 1 g [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and started on Zosyn ( Pip - tazo ) 4 . 5 g Q 8 H on [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 2 * * ] . 
He also developed a allergic reaction on his back , which appeared as erythematous , non - raised target lesions . 
He was taken by podiatry to the operating room on [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 4 * * ] for surgical debridement of his foot ulcer , and found to have an abscess that was drained . 
Wound cultures grew Klebissela pneuomiae with sensitivites to Cipro , Meropenum , Gent , ceftriaxone and less sensitivities to Zosyn , amp / sublactam . 
He was continued on Vanc , but the Zosyn was stopped and he was started on Cipro ( 5 0 0 mg PO bid ) on [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 5 * * ] . 
Wound cultures came back with gram positive cocci , so he was started on Keflex PO 5 0 0 mg qid ( first dose [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 2 - 2 6 * * ] . ) Mr . 
Of note he also had missed his previous 4 doses of lantus insulin . 
He was given 6 units of insulin , 2 liters of IV fluid and transferred to the MICU where he was started on an inslin drip . 
His anion gap eventually close , he glucose was controlled in the 1 5 0 - 2 4 0 ' s range , and his anion gap closed before he was admitted to the medicine floor . 
On the medicine floor the patient was followed by the [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic . 
His lantus dose was reduced to half while he was NPO before procedures , and kept at 2 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] when eating regularly . 
His humalog scale was increased 2 units during his stay because of increasing glucose levels . 
Upon discharge his glucose was stable at 1 6 3 and his anion gap was 1 2 . . 
Anemia : [ * * Known lastname 1 4 6 1 1 * * ] had a hematocrit of 2 7 . 3 on admission , with a range of 2 4 . 4 to 2 8 . 3 , with a discharge hematocrit of 2 6 . 7 .

The patient was doing well at home according to his wife , until early in the evening of admission when he complained of shortness of breath which did not respond to inhalers . 
The patient says he tried his nebulizer in the bathroom as he was getting more short of breath . 
It did not help . 
He then took a shower and felt more short of breath after that . 
The patient called 9 1 1 . 
He was intubated in the field for air movement and respiratory distress , with minimal breath sounds reported and somnolence , however , his oxygen saturation was 9 0 percent on room air . 
In the Emergency Department , the patient was initially started on a Propofol drip which dropped his dropped his blood pressure from 1 6 7 / 1 0 4 to the 9 0 s . 
He was then given approximately 5 liters of intravenous fluids . 
He also received Solu - Medrol and Levofloxacin . 
In the Emergency Department , a femoral line was placed , given his low blood pressure and he was started on Dopamine for the hypotension . 
The patient arrived at the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] stated and easily ventilated with the ventilator . 
Hypertension . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
Coronary artery disease , status post multiple myocardial infarctions , most recently an NSTE myocardial infarction in [ * * 2 1 0 2 - 4 - 6 * * ] . 
Chronic low back pain , status post L 1 - 2 laminectomy . 
Steroid - induced hyperglycemia . 
He has quit . 
He is married . 
He has rare ethyl alcohol . 
This was on his control at 4 8 0 by 2 0 , 4 0 percent FIO 2 and 5 of positive end - expiratory pressure . 
Pupils equal , round and reactive to light . 
Mucous membranes were dry . 
Heart was regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 , tachycardiac . 
Abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended with positive bowel sounds . 
Extremities were without cyanosis , clubbing or edema . 
There was a right femoral line in place . 
The patient was sedated and intubated . 
Sodium was 1 3 8 , potassium 4 . 0 , bicarbonate 2 7 , BUN 2 8 , creatinine 1 , glucose 1 8 7 . 
Blood gas after intubation 7 . 2 3 , 7 4 , 4 7 6 . 
Lactate was 2 . 4 . 
Chest x - ray showed the endotracheal tube in good position , tortuous aorta , emphysematous changes with no evidence of pneumonia or failure . 
An electrocardiogram was sinus tachycardiac at 1 3 0 without any acute ST changes with enlarged P waves in 2 , 3 and AVF . 
This one was similar . 
Within 2 4 hours after admission the patient was easily extubated and did quite well after that , making great improvement , back to his baseline within two days . 
It was felt that this is not consistent with either an asthma attack or a true chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or infection . 
There is concern that some other process was causing the patient ' s acute episodes of shortness of breath . 
In fact , it is not clear the extent of his respiratory distress when he was intubated in the field , initially even though he was oxygenating well and had poor breath sounds at baseline . 
The patient was treated with high - dose steroids initially as well as q . 
However , his lungs have been clear almost immediately upon admission . 
Because of concern that there might be airway collapse contributing , the patient underwent a computerized tomography scan which was designed to look for tracheomalacia . 
The computerized tomography scan was misprotocoled and this could not be evaluated . 
There was a suspicion that there might be left main stem bronchus collapse during expiration and it was read as probable distal tracheomalacia . 
The patient was provided with a BiPAP machine and teaching . 
He responded very well to this at nighttime . 
It was suggested that he use the BiPAP at nighttime and as needed when he feels short of breath and his shortness of breath is not helped by his usual nebulizers . 
The hope is that this might prevent him from needing to call 9 1 1 and from repeated intubations . 
The patient did receive one dose of Levofloxacin , however , there is no sign of infection and this antibiotic was discontinued . 
Hypotension - The patient was initially hypotensive in the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] . 
This was after receiving Propofol and then other sedating medications . 
He required pressors briefly for Dopamine which increased his heart rate and made him tachycardiac . 
He was then switched to Levophed . 
It was felt this was all in the setting of sedating medications as well as ventilator positive end - expiratory pressure as the patient did not actually appear septic at any time , he has had all of that quite well and was normotensive once he was extubated , in fact , on discharge he was restarted on his blood pressure medications . 
Hypertension - The patient has hypertension as an outpatient at baseline . 
His Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were held . 
Initially they were restarted on the day of discharge . 
Coronary artery disease - The patient has a coronary artery disease history . 
He was continued on his Aspirin and his Lipitor during the admission . 
In the setting of hypotension , he did have some hyperacute T waves on electrocardiogram . 
His enzymes were cycled and they were negative for infarction . 
As noted , his Metoprolol and ACE inhibitor were restarted prior to discharge . 
Renal failure - Initially the patient presented with elevated lactate and slightly elevated creatinine but these corrected quickly with fluids . 
Prophylaxis - The patient was continued on a proton pump inhibitors as well as with heparin subcutaneously while in the hospital . 
He was then ambulatory by the day of discharge . 
Code status - The patient confirmed that he is a full code . 
He will also be provided with a BiPAP machine for use as described above . 
The patient should follow up with both his primary care physician and Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 5 7 5 * * ] within the next one to two weeks . 
Call your primary doctor or the Emergency Department with any concerns for shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea or vomiting . 
See your primary doctor , Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) 1 2 2 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 8 4 9 9 * * ] within one week . 
See Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 5 7 5 * * ] within two weeks . 
Use BiPAP machine at night and if you feel your shortness of breath is worsening and your inhalers are not improving your symptoms .

Brief Hospital Course : The patient was initially admitted to MICU [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] for severe encephalopathy requiring intubation in the ED for airway protection . 
She was treated for hepatic encephalopathy , with lactulose and rifaximin . 
Initial cultures revealed carbapenemase - resistant E . coli , for which she was initially treated with nitrofurantoin and amikacin . 
Nitrofurantoin was subsequently discontinued . 
Per ID recommendations , antibiotics were changed to colistin , then ultimately to tetracycline . 
She was weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to the internal medicine service on [ * * 9 - 1 6 * * ] . 
Her lactulose dose was increased . 
Her renal function worsened , which was believed likely due to nephrotoxic medications . 
She was also started on octreotride , midodrine and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome . 
Se was transferred back to MICU Green on [ * * 9 - 1 9 * * ] for worsening encephalopathy and labs consistent with low - grade DIC , including a ten point hematocrit drop , thrombocytopenia , worsening coagulation studies , and indirect hyperbilirubinemia . 
Hematology was consulted and agreed with diagnosis of DIC . 
Over the subsequent days , the patient required large amounts of blood products , including red blood cells , platelets , cryoprecipitate , and fresh frozen plasma . 
Despite these measures , she still had large amounts of bloody output from her rectal tube ; she was felt too unstable to undergo any GI procedures , and was treated with further blood transfusions . 
Her significant hypernatremia and hypercalcemia improved to some degree during her stay in the MICU . 
The patient ' s mental status did not improve , and she was reintubated for hypoxic respiratory failure , which was partially due to a new pneumonia . 
Her mental status was sufficiently poor that she only required intermittent sedation for her endotracheal tube . 
She had high residuals through her OG tube , and tube feeds frequently had to be held . 
She had frequent bloody secretions from her endotracheal tube ; bronchoscopy revealed diffuse oozing of blood throughout her bronchi . 
Multiple family meetings were held , including a meeting with the patient ' s primary hepatologist , who confirmed that the patient was not a candidate for retransplantation . 
As the patient ' s liver disease was believed to be a central factor in her deteriorating condition , measures were transitioned towards making the patient comfortable and prolonging her life only long enough for her family members to be able to say goodbye . 
She passed away peacefully with her family at her side .

The patient is schizophrenic per history and is unable to provide a history of his own . 
Per discussion with the floor nurse from his nursing home , a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a cough that was consistent with a pneumonia . 
He was started on a Z - pack . 
One day prior to admission , he developed tachypnea and started to desaturated in the the low 8 0 ' s . 
EMS were call and he was stat low 9 0 ' s on a NRB . 
He was brought in by Ambulance . 
In the ED , initial VS were T 9 9 , HR 1 2 0 , BP 1 0 4 / 7 9 , RR 2 4 satting 9 2 % on NRB .

CXR [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 6 - 2 6 * * ] Compared with [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 6 - 2 5 * * ] at 5 : 4 6 a . m . , an NG tube is again noted . 
It overlies the lower chest , but appears to overlie the gastric fundus , which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation , as seen on [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 6 - 2 4 * * ] CT scan . 
If clinically indicated , a lateral view could help to confirm this . 
Again noted is ET tube in satisfactory position above the carina . 
Prominence of right paratracheal soft tissues is noted , but may be accentuated due to patient rotation . 
There is focal opacity in the right upper zone and patchy opacity in the right lower zone medially .

Treated with Avastin ( bevacizumab ) , 5 FU , and Leucovorin . 
Last treatment [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 9 - 2 5 * * ] .

Married . 
Former restaurant worker , not working presently . 
Has a 3 5 pack year smoking history , quit ~ [ * * 2 1 1 8 * * ] . 
Rarely drinks alcohol .

PT - 1 5 . 6 PTT - 2 7 . 9 INR ( PT ) - 1 . 7 . 
GRAN CT - 7 8 0 . 
LACTATE - 1 . 7 . 
Since his admission , the patient ' s diarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime , vancomycin , and metronidazole as well as Lomotil . 
Since then his course has been complicated by a steadily declining hematocrit ( 3 3 to 2 5 over the admission ) , worsening thrombocytopenia , and a new coagulopathy ( INR up to 5 . 4 ) . 
On [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] , he was noted to be hypoxemic and had chest x - ray showing only a distended stomach and a CTA with no PE ( but also a distended stomach and known liver mets ) . 
ABG was 7 . 4 4 / 2 5 / 6 3 then 7 . 3 2 / 2 1 / 8 4 that afternoon . 
His oxygen requirement waxed and waned , from mid 8 0 ' s on room air to mid 9 0 ' s on room air . 
His hypoxemia persisted and the patient became increasingly tired , confused , and tachypneic . 
A repeat ABG was 7 . 3 / 1 9 / 7 5 but his lactate had climbed from 3 . 5 to 8 . 0 . 
He was transferred to the ICU at which time he was fatigued and appeared disoriented . 
In this setting , he denied pain ( including abdominal ) as well as dyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use . 
He was started on IVF with 3 amps bicarb , lactate trended down , acidosis resolving . 
CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut off for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management recommeneded by surgery . 
Primary oncologist Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] continued to follow . 
In the ICU he was found to have guiaic positive NGT secretions . 
He was transfused PRBCs for a dropping HCT . 
In addition he was noted to have an elevated INR for which he was treated with FFP . 
He was evaluated by surgery who felt him to be a poor surgical candidate . 
For his confusion a CT of his head was performed which was negative for bleed or other change . 
His hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspiration initially . 
He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional status . 
He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no improvement . 
On [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 1 0 - 1 8 * * ] a family meeting was held at which time it was decided that the goal of care was maximal comfort . 
At that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids and analgesia but to limit other medications and TPN . 
The family will provide Chinese herbs and prayer . 
The patient was covered with cefepime , vancomycin , and flagyl given neutropenic fever . 
The CT of abdomen on admission did not show any inflammatory processes in the abdomen . 
The patient was given supportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples for cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with lomotil . 
However , patient became acidotic and CT abdomen was repeated and revealed SBO . 
NGT was placed and surgey was consulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgical candidate . 
Patient was continued on medical management . 
Octreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieve obstruction . 
His lactate continued to trend down and NGT outout began to slow . 
Patient denied any abdominal pain . 
However , while in the ICU he developed bloody stools in the setting of coagulopathy . 
This was felt to be likely secondary to his rectal cancer . 
He was tranfused pRBCs and FFP . 
After several bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel movements slowed , his coags improved and his hematocrit was stable . 
Coagulopathy : Likely DIC secondary to cancer . 
He devloped GI bleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of FFP and pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets . 
By tranfer from the ICU his HCT and INR was stable but platelets were 3 4 . 
The patient and family did not want any further transfusions as their goal was comfort and this would require daily monitoring of his CBC and coags . 
He had some fevers early in his hospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of his admission . 
He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was otained which revealed likely aspiration / pneumonia . 
He was continue on his antibiotics to complete a 1 4 day course and received daily neupogen injections . 
By the 1 1 th day of his antibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic . 
His neupogen was discontinued and he remained afebrile . 
Patient refused central line / sepsis protocol in ED . 
Lactate normalized after IVF . 
Then the patient continued to have non - anion gap acidosis [ * * 1 - 2 4 * * ] to diarrhea . 
ABG was obtained and the patient appropriately compensated with decreased CO 2 ( 2 5 ) with normal pH 7 . 4 - 7 . 4 4 . 
He then became more hypoxic and acidotc and was tranferred to the ICU . 
In the ICU it was discoved that he had an extremely dilated stomach and SBO . 
It was felt that the lactic acidosis , may have been secondary to the extreme distension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate on decompression with NGT . 
His gap closed and his lactate conitnued to tened down . 
Given that he did not tolerate this well , no further chemotherapy was planned . 
He also developed what is believed to be lower GI bleed , SBO and DIC during admission all which were thaough to be related to his metastatic disease . 
Due to his poor prognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting was held and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the most important goal at this point . 
He was continued on IVF and the NGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO . 
It was decided that no further blood products would be given . 
FEN : Patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrhea and acidosis . 
He was continued on IVF given his SBO . 
Given his poor prognosis and that comfort was the goal , he was not started on TPN , but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO .

GERD 7 . 
HTN 8 . 
OA 9 . 
Son is HCP . 
No EtOH . 
Hypothyroidism , Primary : patient was found to have TSH on admit of 9 . 0 , repeat was still elevated at 7 . 3 ; T 4 was low at 3 . 9 , c / w primary hypothyroidism ; pt was started on Synthroid 1 1 2 mcg / day . 
Endocrine was consulted and did not feel many of his symptoms were secondary to hypothyroidism . 
They wanted to decrease his synthroid to 5 0 mcg , recheck his TSH in 1 week and then decrease again to 2 5 mcg . 
This should be done at rehab . 
Bradycardia : thought likely [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] hypothyroidism , maintained on on tele , had episodes of brady down to 3 5 s occassionally with longest pause 2 . 2 seconds . 
Cardiology evaluated while the patient was in the MICU , said that the patient did not require pacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure or symptoms , which patient did not have during his hospital stay ; thought likely to resolve as Synthroid takes effect . 
Will need outpatient follow up . 
Hypotherm : also likely [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] hypothyroidism , will warm as needed for now . 
Did not improve with synthroid . 
The patient should be followed closely , if his temp drops farther , he should be rewarmed . 
Pancytopenia : patient was noted on admission to have WBC 1 . 9 down from baseline 6 . 0 , Hct 2 6 . 2 down from baseline 3 0 , plts 2 1 down from baseline 9 0 - 1 0 0 . 
Patient currently receiving Epogen ? 5 0 0 0 or 2 0 , 0 0 0 units / week , received at the VA , but not followed by a Hematologist . 
Has had fairly stable counts until [ * * 2 1 7 4 * * ] . 
In [ * * 1 1 - 1 9 * * ] anemia began , and was thought to be [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] kidney disease . 
EGD and cspy in [ * * 5 - 2 1 * * ] were negative for bleed , iron studies were c / w anemia of chronic disease with low retic count 1 . 7 % . 
Heme recommended increasing his Epo to 4 0 , 0 0 0 units per week , which was initiated while he was in house on the night prior to his discharge . 
Heme also noted that his peripheral smear contained strange - looking cells suspicious for myelodysplastic process . 
They do not feel that a BM biopsy would change his management , but plan to follow him in clinic . 
Of note , the patient ' s WBC count returned to the patient ' s normal range , his hct remained stable after receiving 2 units PRBCs . 
His plt count remains low but is slowly trending upwards . 
He has had no evid of bleeding but we are holding ASA given this significant risk ( he has a h / o falls ) . 
Blood sugars : pt has h / o DM 2 , was started on RISS as glyburide was held , then patient became hyponatremic , possibly because of hypothyroidism ; was on a D 5 W drip briefly , RISS adjusted to keep sugars in check ; pt seems very sensative to insulin at bedtime when he is not eating , so this scale was decreased compared to his daytime dosing . 
If patient needs to be started on a oral hypoglycemic , he should not be restarted on his glyburide as it is renally cleared . 
Glipizide can be considered . 
ARF : pt ' s creatinine bumped to 4 . 1 from 3 . 5 on day prior to discharge ; likely prerenal in setting of overdiuresis , net negative 1 7 0 0 day prior . 
Rehydrated gently with 5 0 0 cc , rechecked BUN and Cr afterwards with resolution . 
Baseline Cr 3 . 5 . . 
Constipation : possibly [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] hypothyroid , increased bowel regimen . 
CAD : CEs flat , ASA held [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] low platelets ; cont statin ; holding BB [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] AVB , bradycardia . 
He should not be restarted on a beta blocker . 
CHF : patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [ * * 2 - 1 9 * * ] his CXR and his clinical presentation ; this was thought to be due to a combination of bradycardia , anemia and possible infection ; TTE showed LVH but no evid of worsening heart function with LVEF > 5 5 % . 
Pt was initially diuresed with Lasix 4 0 mg IV as needed , then became overdry with bump in creatinine , was given some fluid back via NS boluses , and is being discharged euvolemic . 
Needs 1 more day . 
HTN : continued prazosin , increased to 2 mg prasozin at night , also increased Hydralazine .

Followup Instructions : Please set up an appointment with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 5 7 6 2 * * ] upon discharge to be re - evaluated in the week after leaving the hospital . 
You will need to have labs drawn to check your renal ( kidney ) function and your thyroid function , and will also need to be seen regarding your congestive heart failure . 
You should also be seen by your eye doctor at [ * * Hospital 1 3 1 2 8 * * ] . 
Neck X - ray was performed and revealed possible thickened epiglottis but she left the ED AMA prior to finalized [ * * Location ( un ) 1 1 3 1 * * ] . 
She then returned to the OSH ED at approximately 1 0 pm with new onset stridor and hoarseness . 
She was also noted to be altered with slurred speech and there was concern for intoxication . 
She was intubated with a 7 - 0 ETT for airway protection with emesis noted post - intubation . 
CT neck reportedly revealed thickened epiglottis and CT head was negative for acute process . 
She received Ceftriaxone , Decadron 1 0 mg IV , and was transferred here by [ * * Location ( un ) 7 6 2 2 * * ] . 
She received pancuronium , 4 mg IV versed , 4 mg IV ativan at OSH .

The atelectatic streak in the left mid zone has cleared . 
At the current time , there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion or pleural effusion . 
Brief Hospital Course : Assessment and Plan : 4 4 year old woman with schizoaffective disorder and SAH s / p coiling L MCA aneurysm transferred from OSH with with epiglottitis and resp distress now intubated . 
Epiglottitis / Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure : Patient initially presented to OSH with sore throat and was found to have imaging ( Neck X ray and CT per report ) consistent with epiglottitis . 
ABG also consistent with hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis with concomitant metabolic alkalosis . 
She left OSH ED and subsequently presented with stridor and was intubated for airway protection . 
Epiglottitis can be caused by thermal or inhalational injury but is more commonly caused by infection . 
The most common bacterial causes include H flu , strep pneumo , beta hemolytic strep and staph aureus but viral causes are also possible . 
Patient was intially treated with decadron and empiric ceftriaxne . 
She was on insulin ss while on steroids . 
Rapid resp viral panel sent , antigen was negative , viral cultures pending at the time of discharge ; blood cx sent and were no growth . 
Patient was evaluated by ENT with laryngoscopy while intubated and again after extubation . 
Initial impression was that epiglottis was mildly inflamed . 
After she was extubated , she had another endoscopic exam and was noted to have some vocal cord dysfunction , improved with relaxation techniques and no obvious epiglottitis . 
Patient was transferred to the floor on [ * * 1 0 - 3 * * ] and continued to do well . 
Still had a sore throat , but no wheezing or shortness of breath , no dysphagia . 
ENT also recommended increasing omprazole to 4 0 mg daily . 
Have scheduled outpt ENT follow - up . 
Etiology was felt to be possibly secondary to biting the tube versus related to propofol . 
Patient had some pleuritic chest pain related to chest compressions later in hospital course , treated with ibuprofen , tylenol and one dose oxycodone . 
Anemia : HCT at current baseline 3 0 - 3 2 with high normal MCV . 
No current active issues - continue aspirin 3 2 5 mg PO daily , has f / u scheduled with Neurosurgery . 
Asthma : Continue albuterol prn ( MDI while intubated ) although no current wheezing on exam .

Discharge Instructions : You were admitted with wheezing and difficulty breathing and required intubation . 
You also had a cardiac arrest which lasted a short period with return of your heart beat with cpr / chest compressions . 
The likely cause of the wheezing was vocal cord dysfunction , although a viral illness and or gastric reflux may have been contributing . 
There was initially concern about epiglottitis ( inflammation of the epiglottis ) , but this only mildly inflamed when they looked with a camera in your throat . 
You will need to take a higher dose of omeprazole ( 4 0 mg ) and will need to follow - up with ENT and pcp as scheduled . 
This note is based heavily on the information gathered by the ED physicians and the Neurologist who consulted in the ED . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname 6 2 5 2 3 * * ] is a 5 6 - year - old man with a history of alcohol abuse with recent admission for presumed Wernicke encephalopathy , alcohol withdrawal who presented from his skilled nursing / rehab center for agitation after being discharged from [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] two days ago . 
At the rehab facility , the patient spent the last 2 4 hours in severe agitation that required 4 - point restraints and multiple chemical restraints in order for him to calm down . 
According to the Neurologist in the ED , he was disoriented , tachycardic , agitated , and diaphoretic in the setting of presumed 3 days abstinence from benzos . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname 6 2 5 2 3 * * ] had some restriction in eye movements but no gaze deviation and no lateralizing signs at this point . 
Neurology believes withdrawal is the most likely etiology . 
If fevers develop , he may require a lumbar puncture . 
In the absence of complications , symptoms can persist for up to seven days . 
Additionally as he does not seem to have full abduction of his eyes , Neurology recommends continuing on IV thiamine for presumed Wernicke ' s . 
Given that the mammillary bodies are enriched with dopamine receptors , would avoid Haldol as this may exacerbate his Wernicke Korsakoff ' s pathology . 
Last HIV test negative 2 . 5 years ago . 
Last drink was 3 pm on [ * * 2 1 2 9 - 8 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Denies ever smoking . 
Lives with his brother , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] . 
Family History : DM 2 in both parents , PTSD in his father . 
Brother is also on methadone maintenance program . 
Exam is limited by patient rotation . 
Lung volumes are low . 
Pulmonary vessels are engorged . 
There is no effusion or pneumothorax . 
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal . 
Non - specific slight ST segment elevation in the precordial leads and lateral leads . 
Possible early repolarization . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 2 9 - 9 - 7 * * ] bradycardia is new , ST segment elevation is slightly more pronounced and could be rate related . 
Brief Hospital Course : The patient is a 5 7 - year - old man with a history of alcohol dependence who was recently discharged after detoxifying at [ * * Hospital 1 1 5 3 5 * * ] but also suffering from Wernicke - Korsakoff ' s syndrome , who presented from his nursing facility with altered mental status . 
Delirium / altered mental status : Patient had been agitated at nursing facility . 
TSH , B 1 2 , folate , and lactate all within normal limits . 
Ammonia also normal . 
Patient was been afebrile , WBC was normal , CXR and UA negative . 
CT head was negative . 
Neurology and Psychiatry consulted . 
Psychiatry discovered that patient was receiving oxazepam at facility . 
Combined with the significant ( 1 2 mg IV ) lorazepam he received in Emergency Department and 5 mg IV more on initial evening in ICU , benzodiazepine intoxication felt to be responsible for much of altered mental status . 
Benzos stopped and replaced with Zyprexa to a maximum dose of 3 5 mg daily with monitoring of QTc ( 4 0 7 on last day of ICU stay ) . 
Patient continued on folate , multivitamin , vitamin D and thiamine . 
Patient restarted on home olanzapine 5 mg QAM and 1 5 mg QPM per psychiatry recs . 
EKG was periodically monitored for prolongation of the QTc . 
He continued to be agitated particularly at night and was started on trazadone 1 0 0 mg QHS and mirtazepine 3 0 mg PO QHS . 
He improved on this regimen . 
After originally planning to send the patient to a dementia unit , eventually his brother made the decision to take him home with 2 4 hour supervision at his home . 
Vitamin supplementation was discontinued on discharge as patient is no longer drinking alcohol . 
He will follow up frequently with his PCP and will also follow up with cognitive neurology . 
Hyponatremia : Patient presented with hyponatremia . 
He may have been volume down at his nursing facility , esecially if he has been agitated and unable to take PO . 
During his last hospitalization , his sodium was well within normal limits . 
Sodium corrected to low normal with maintenance fluids . 
This is a chronic issue for Mr . [ * * Known lastname 6 2 5 2 3 * * ] . 
He was treated with ibuprofen , tylenol and lidocaine patch , which helped .

He was recently admitted to the BMT service from [ * * 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] until [ * * 1 2 - 1 * * ] for fevers and progressive ALL . 
Infectious work - up was unremarkable and his fevers were atrributed to a reaction to platelet transfusion . 
Of note , he had another admission earlier in [ * * Month ( only ) * * ] at which point he developed a strep viridans line infection ( from PICC line ) - - the PICC line was removed , he was treated with a course of PCN G which was changed to augmentin at his last admission with the last dose due either yesterday or today . 
After finding him this morning , his mother brought him back to 7 [ * * Hospital Ward Name 1 8 2 6 * * ] today for readmission and an ambulance was called from there to bring him to the ED .

ROS : Unable to obtain . 
Past Medical History : < b > HEMATOLOGIC / ONCOLOGIC HISTORY : < / b > Mr . [ * * Known lastname 2 4 7 9 * * ] was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 - 3 1 * * ] . 
He presented to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 1 5 - 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] with complaints of diffuse myalgias and arthralgias . 
A CT scan demonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes ( largest 1 . 5 x 2 . 7 cm ) and portacaval lymph nodes ( largest 1 . 9 cm x 3 . 4 ) as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes , the largest measuring 1 . 2 x 1 . 9 cm . 
On [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 - 6 * * ] , he underwent a CT - guided fine - needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph node which was nondiagnostic . 
A bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 2 - 2 6 * * ] , demonstrating involvement by high - grade B - cell lymphoproliferative disorder . 
Tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan B cell markers CD 2 0 and PAX - 5 , with co - expression of CD 1 0 and bcl - 2 . 
TdT staining was equivocal , with predominantly cytoplasmic staining and a rare cell with dim nuclear staining . 
MIB - 1 staining showed an overall proliferation index of 5 0 - 6 0 % , with focal areas with a higher fraction . 
The differential diagnosis was felt to include lymphoblastic lymphoma / leukemia ( precursor B - cell lymphoma / leukemia ) or a blastic transformation / progression of a mature B cell lymphoma . 
It was noted that a definitive diagnosis would require flow cytometry and molecular studies , which could not be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheral blood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained ( dry tap ) . 
However , the peripheral blood sample was sent for immunophenotyping , which demonstrated a new population of CD 3 4 positive cells and a small population of CD 1 9 positive cells in the " blast " gait , without expression of TdT . 
It was felt that these findings should be interpreted with caution since no blasts were identified on a corresponding peripheral smear . 
Given his significant liver dysfunction and other medical co - morbidities , the initial treatment regimen chosen for the patient consisted of R - CHOP , which was initiated on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 3 - 4 * * ] . 
He received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 3 - 2 4 * * ] , consisting of R - CHOP without vincristine , which was held secondary to neuropathy . 
Modified Hyper - CVAD Course A was given on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 4 - 1 0 * * ] , with a second course given on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 5 - 1 5 * * ] and a third course on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 6 - 2 2 * * ] . 
Course B was not given due to his history of hepatic cirrhosis . 
Of note , the patient has known retinal involvement by his lymphoma , for which he is followed by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] of ophthalmology . 
A liver biopsy on [ * * 5 - 8 * * ] and repeat bone marrow biopsies on [ * * 6 - 1 2 * * ] and [ * * 7 - 1 9 * * ] have shown no evidence of recurrent lymphoma . 
The patient presented on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 0 - 1 5 * * ] with myalgias , headache , mental status changes , and fevers . 
A CBC showed a WBC of 7 . 2 with 1 4 % blasts . 
A bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marked fibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia / lymphoma . 
He was treated with rituximab 5 0 0 mg , given in three doses of 1 0 0 mg , 2 0 0 mg , and 2 0 0 mg on [ * * 1 0 - 9 * * ] - [ * * 1 0 - 1 1 * * ] . 
In addition , he was treated with rituximab 3 7 5 mg / m 2 , cyclophosphamide 7 5 0 mg / m 2 , doxorubicin 2 0 mg / m 2 , and dexamethasone 2 0 mg from [ * * 1 0 - 1 9 * * ] - [ * * 1 0 - 2 1 * * ] . 
The patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 1 - 9 * * ] , with a bone marrow biopsy on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] showing residual leukemia in the marrow . 
After extensive discussion , he opted to continue palliative chemotherapy with rituximab and prednisone . 
Rituximab was started on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 1 - 1 6 * * ] at 1 0 0 mg , with plans to continue threrapy with 2 0 0 mg daily on [ * * 1 1 - 1 7 * * ] and [ * * 1 1 - 1 8 * * ] .

SKIN : Scattered ecchymoses on LUE ( by PICC line ) and abdomen . 
No jaundice , cyanosis , or gross dermatitis . 
No ecchymoses . 
Aside from mild plate - like atelectasis at the base of the left base , lungs are clear . 
There is no pleural effusion . 
Heart size is normal . 
CT abd / pelvis : Slightly worsened ascites . 
No change in splenomegaly , cholelithiasis , portal lymphadenopathy . 
Bibasal opacities new since [ * * Month ( only ) 3 5 9 * * ] , could be due to atelectasis , pneumonia , aspiration . 
CT head : No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities . 
MR with gadolinium would be more sensitive for intracranial infections or masses . 
KUB : Non - specific bowel gas pattern without free intraperitoneal air . 
CXR PA and lat : Interpretation is limited by patient rotation and kyphotic angulation . 
However , there is no evidence of pleural effusion or focal consolidation . 
Allowing for change in positioning , the study is overall not significantly changed since [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] . 
There is a focus of linear atelectasis at the left lung base . 
Wedge compression deformities of two low thoracic vertebral bodies are unchanged . 
Brief Hospital Course : Patient was a 5 3 year - old male with a history of relapsing refractory ALL on prednisone and rituximab and HCV cirrhosis who presents with fever , altered mental status , and hypotension . 
Patient was hypotensive , started on pressors , given IVF , worsened in the setting of adrenal insuffiency , and synthetic hepatic dysfunction . 
Patient was intubated . 
Once infectious etiology was eliminated , patient ' s dim prognosis was discussed with family and a determination was made to make the patient CMO . 
Patient was extubated and started on morphine drip . 
Patient , due to high drug tolerance , continued to have pain and was responsive on morphine drip . 
Patient was transferred from the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] to BMT floor for CMO continuation . 
Patient continued to show signs of discomfort and sedatation was switched to dilaudid and ativan drip . 
Patient expired at 7 : 2 0 pm on [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 2 - 1 0 * * ] secondary to respiratory failure from relapsing refractory ALL in the presence of the family . 
The proxy , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) 2 4 7 9 * * ] , the patient ' s son , consented to a full autopsy . 
On POD 8 , the patient had an anastamotic leak and underwent a Hartmann ' s procedure with creation of an ascending colostomy . 
His post operative course was subsequently complicated by acute renal failure , small peripheral pulmonary emboli , HIT positivity on argatroban , and atrial fibrillation aon an amiodarone drip . 
His sedation was weaned to prn dilaudid and oxycodone liquid . 
Pain gradually became a nonissue . 
He should not require pain medication even for VAC changes . 
He was seen by neurology for dystonia , who recommended an MRI of the brain whcih showed an acute left parietal subcortical infarct . 
The neurologist felt that coumadinizing him with a goal INR 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 would be best to prevent another stroke . 
The etiology of his stoke is presumed cardiac given his atrial fibrillation . 
His cognition gradually improved throughout his hospital course , as did his dystonia , for which he is on cogentin per neurology . 
At present , he is alert and can communicate effectovely . 
Cards On admission , Mr . [ * * Known lastname 7 7 9 8 2 * * ] had afib with RVR for which he was on an amiodarone gtt . 
He was evaluated by cardiology and weaned off amiodarone . 
After amiodarone was weaned , his rhythm was intermittently in and out of afib . 
He eventually stabilized on PO lopressor and PO amiodarone . 
In addition , he was intermittently on and off pressors , including levophed and pitressin . 
Eventually he stabilized and has been off of all pressors for over 2 weeks prior to discharge . 
Pulm The patient had a tracheostomy . 
He was gradually weaned on the ventillator . 
Eventually he was weaned to trach collar , which he has been tolerating for over 2 weeks . 
On [ * * 5 - 4 * * ] , he did tolerate a Passy - muir valve trial . 
He requires supervision with the PM valve , because he desaturates . 
He does require suctioning intermittently . 
FEN / GI Tube feeds via Dobhoff , TPN , ostomy , serial abdominal debridements [ * * 4 - 4 * * ] , [ * * 4 - 8 * * ] , and abdominal VAC [ * * 4 - 1 2 * * ] , 1 6 , 1 7 , 2 0 , 2 4 , 2 6 and Q 3 days thereafter . 
Last VAC change was [ * * 2 1 1 2 - 5 - 8 * * ] . 
His abdominal wound has been healing very well with a VAC dressing . 
It is granulating nicely . 
There had been a fistulous connection between the ostomy and the wound . 
This has since closed off after a few vicryl sutures were placed at the bedside . 
He was seen and evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended outpatient skin grafting . 
He has been tolerating tube feeds at goal for over 2 weeks prior to discharge and his ostomy is productive . 
He gets his tube feeds via a Dobhoff . 
We did not feel that a PEG was a good idea in him beacause of his anatomy . 
He was hypernatremic to 1 5 3 at a maximum , but he did respond to free water boluses and his sodium has since stabilized . 
We have since decreased his free water boluses .

A small amount of ascites . 
Spleen 1 3 . 8 cm . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 7 - 1 6 * * ] : RSC in SVC . 
No acute cardiopulm processes . 
TIPS stent is patent but velocities could not be obtained due to respiratory motion and therefore satisfactory baseline data could not be obtained . 
Abdominal Ultrasound [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Patent TIPS with slightly increased velocities . 
New 4 cm echogenic wedge - shaped structure in the right lobe . 
Given its development since examinations of 9 and 1 1 days ago , it is unlikely to be a mass , however , MRI can be performed on a nonemergent basis for further characterization . 
Slight increase in ascites . 
Portable CXR [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 7 - 3 1 * * ] : There has been interval extubation and removal of right - sided vascular catheter and sheath . 
Right PICC line has been placed , terminating in the proximal superior vena cava . 
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size allowing for low lung volumes . 
Previously present mild pulmonary edema has resolved . 
There is improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region with residual patchy opacity containing several air bronchograms . 
Although possibly due to resolving atelectasis and dependent edema , infectious pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate setting . 
Minor right basilar atelectasis is noted as well as a possible small right pleural effusion . 
The renal parenchymal thickness and echogenicity are normal . 
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi . 
Small amount of ascites is noted .

Brief Hospital Course : # Alcoholic Cirrhosis / Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis : Admitted to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] from outside hospital after recent variceal bleed s / p variceal banding . 
Here , repeat EGD was performed which showed previously banded esophageal varices and gastric varices with stigmata of recent bleeding . 
No new bands placed . 
Subsequently underwent uncomplicated TIPS on [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 7 - 1 6 * * ] . 
Completed 5 day course of octreotide and 7 day course of levofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis . 
Unfortunately , patient continued to decompensate , with rising bilirubin and INR . 
She was treated with lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy . 
Ultrasound [ * * 7 - 1 8 * * ] and [ * * 7 - 2 0 * * ] both showed patent TIPS . 
Given rising bili / INR , she was given a trial of pentoxyfilline and ursodiol for suspected acute alcoholic hepatitis . 
Corticosteroids not given because of recent bleeding . 
However , her synthetic function did not improve , and her creatinine subsequently rose from 0 . 6 to 3 . 0 . 
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed ( on [ * * 7 - 2 9 * * ] ) , which demonstrated no evidence of SBP . 
Her pentoxyfilline and ursodiol were discontinued as there was no clear improvement on treatment . 
She was started empirically on octreotide / midodrine for possible hepatorenal syndrome . 
Nephrotoxic medications were held and she was given volume repletion both with normal saline and albumin . 
Creatinine subsequently improved to 1 . 2 - 1 . 4 at the time of discharge . 
For nutritional support a post - pyloric feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were intiated per nutrition recommendations . 
She will be discharged for continued nutritional support to meet caloric goals . 
She was seen by social work for substance abuse support . 
In addition , she was provided with information on post - discharge support services . 
MELD at time of discharge was 3 3 , driven by a bilirubin of 1 9 . 8 , creatinine of 1 . 4 , and an INR of 2 . 9 . . 
Diuretics held given renal failure and lack of ascites on ultrasound , s / p TIPS . 
She underwent EGD a few hours after arrival , and it showed 3 esophageal variceal bands and gastric varices which had recent stigmata of bleeding but no active bleeding . 
She was supported with blood products and underwent TIPS as above . 
Her hematocrit subsequently remained stablized with no further evidence of active GI bleeding . 
Repeat EGD on [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 8 - 3 * * ] prior to discharge showed no significant varices in the esophagus . 
There was noted granularity , friability , erythema , congestion , abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach consistent with portal gastropathy , but no active bleeding . 
Started empirically on midodrine / octreotide . 
However urine sodium > 1 0 , so was not completely consistent with HRS . 
Paracentesis [ * * 7 - 2 9 * * ] demonstrated no evidence of bacterial peritonitis . 
Urinalysis demonstrated no eosinophils . 
Ultrasound on [ * * 7 - 3 0 * * ] showed no hydronephrosis , but did show a new echogenic wedge shaped structure in right lobe , of unclear clinical significance . 
No other evidence of infarcts / ischemia were noted , and lupus anti - coagulant was sent and was negative as well . 
Renal service was consulted and nephrotoxic medications were held . 
She was repleted with IV fluids and renal function subsequently improved , with creatinine trending down from 3 . 0 to 1 . 4 , with good urine output . 
Subsequently remained stable in low 9 0 ' s - 1 0 0 ' s systolic , in setting of chronic liver disease . 
Initially started on Zosyn and Vancomycin as well as Levaquin for concern for infectious etiology , however antibiotics subsequently discontinued as no infectious source identified . 
Of note , blood cultures from [ * * 7 - 1 7 * * ] grew 1 / 4 bottles STAPHYLOCOCCUS , COAGULASE NEGATIVE . 
This was considered contaminant and repeat blood cultures were negative . 
Covered as inpatient on sliding scale insulin and glargine . 
Discharged on glargine 2 4 units / night , and the patient demonstrated how to use SSI at home . 
Metformin and alternative oral hypoglycemics contra - indicated in setting of her cirrhosis . 
All heparin products were held . 
Platelet count remained low secondary to liver disease , but stable , with no clear evidence of clinical thrombosis . 
Tube feeds will continue upon discharge with outpatient services arranged .

Brief Hospital Course : BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE : 7 0 y / o female without significant past medical history who presented initially with 4 days of cough , malaise , fever at home dx with pneumonia via xray , admitted to MICU for increased O 2 demand and acute kidney injury . 
Ultimately intubated for respiratory distress and found to have Pneumococcal sepsis w / course c / b MODS . 
Patient had progressive increasing work of breathing ultimately requiring intubation . 
This was further complicated by the development of ARDS in the setting of septic shock , and pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation . 
Her pneumonia was treated with antibiotics ( see below ) and she diuresis was started once she was HD stable . 
Her respiratory status slowly improved . 
However , there was concern that due to critical illness myopathy and resulting poor inspiratory effort , she would be at high risk of re - intubation . 
A tracheostomy was performed on [ * * 6 - 3 0 * * ] . 
Prior to discharge the patient was off the ventilator with normal saturation on trach mask at FIO 2 of 4 0 % . 
Her CXR initially showed RLL infiltrate but evolved quickly to involve both lungs . 
She shortly thereafter became hypotensive and was aggressively fluid repleted and temporarily required vasopressors . 
Her blood cultures from OSH prior to transfer grew Peniccilin sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae , as did her sputum cultures here . 
She completed a 1 4 day course of antitiobics on [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 6 - 2 7 * * ] . 
She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable prior to discharge . 
Renal ultrasound revealed no alternative cause such as hydronephrosis . 
Her renal function gradually improved as she became HD stable . 
Creatinine on discharge was 1 . 2 . . 
Patter was concerning for [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] heparin was discontinued , argatroban was started . 
Thrombocytopenia ultimately felt to be medication related . 
Famotidine was discontinued . 
Patient ' s platelet count gradually normalized . 
Slowly improved but some concern for waxing / [ * * Doctor Last Name 6 8 8 * * ] consciousness . 
MRI revealed multiple acute subcortical infarctions in both cerebral hemispheres . 
EEG was concerning for brief bursts of slowing seen multifocally , but especially in the right frontal region suggestive of possible seizure activity . 
Her EEG prior to discharge demonstrated no seizure activity . 
Her clinical status continued to improve . 
Outpatient neurology follow - up was arranged . 
Slowly improved throughout her course . 
Her clinical status continued to improve . 
Outpatient neurology follow - up was arranged . 
Gradually resolved and afebrile for the 7 2 hours prior to discharge . 
Stool guaiac negative . 
B 1 2 / folate / iron studies unremarkable , hemolysis labs negative ; low ferritin and low retic index indicate hypoproliferative anemia . 
Likely anemia of acute disease . 
Remained stable at 2 4 . 3 prior to discharge . 
She should have her hematocrit trended daily initially . 
Our transfusion criteria had been hct < 2 1 . 
Evaluation by general dentistry revealed multiple broken molars which need extraction . 
Will need outpatient f / u with oral surgery as well . 
She was initially treated with nodal blocking [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 6 0 * * ] with resulting hypotension . 
She eventually responded well to amiodarone . 
Ultimately felt secondary to hypotension , however in setting of persisten fevers there was some concern for acalculous cholecystitis . 
RUQ ultrasound was initially concerning for tense / enlarged gallbladder , but upon further review by interventional radiology felt to be within normal limits and not consistent with alcalculous cholecystitis . 
LFTs were downtrending throughout the remainder of her hospital course .

You were admitted to the medical ICU on [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 6 - 1 3 * * ] with pneumonia causing severe systemic infection and respiratory failure . 
You were intubated and treated with antibiotics . 
Your course was complicated by kidney failure which caused your body to become severely fluid overloaded , and by severe muscle weakness caused by long ICU stay . 
You were too weak to be directly extubated so instead you had a tracheostomy ( breathing tube placed in your neck ) . 
Your symptoms slowly and steadily improved with treatment and you are now ready for discharge to a rehab facility where you will have frequent physical therapy to help you regain your strength . 
Please attend the follow - up appointment listed below with dentistry ( for dental x - rays and to possibly have some broken teeth pulled ) .

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN . 
QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED . 
SINGLY AND IN PAIRS . 
QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED . 
NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR . 
Right upper lobe ground - glass parenchymal opacity , suggestive of pneumonia . 
Multifocal coalescent ground - glass nodules , predominating upper lobes but also present in left lower lobe , raise question of metastatic involvement . 
Moderate right pleural effusion . 
Massive conglomerate aortocaval mass with central areas of necrosis , which compresses the IVC , right common and external iliac veins , and likely also right proximal ureter . 
Extensive mediastinal , hilar , mesenteric , retroperitoneal , and iliac lymphadenopathy and massive splenomegaly . 
Overall picture suggestive of lymphoma / lymphoproliferative disease . 
Mildly prominent common bile duct . 
Please correlate with liver function test . 
Diffuse gallbladder mural edema , likely related to systemic disease , unlikely due to cholecystitis . 
Multiple left renal lesions are incompletely evaluated , including a 1 2 - mm interpolar left renal lesion ( 3 , 3 0 1 ) , which could be further characterized by ultrasound . 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect . 
Although there is no CT evidence of large intracranial mass , MRI with gadolinium is superior in evaluation of such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated . 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2 D or color Doppler . 
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0 - 1 0 mmHg . 
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size and regional / global systolic function are normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened . 
There is no valvular aortic stenosis . 
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output . 
Mild ( 1 + ) aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
There is no mitral valve prolapse . 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen . 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal . 
There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion . 
No evidence of hydronephrosis , with resolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on CT [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 1 1 - 1 5 * * ] . 
Nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminate lesion seen on CT scan [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 1 1 - 1 5 * * ] , due to limited visualization . 
For further evaluation , if clinically relevant , an MR could be performed . 
Thoracic aorta , stable and within normal limits . 
Position of previously described left subclavian approach advanced central venous catheter remains unchanged terminating overlying the SVC at the level of the carina . 
No pneumothorax is seen . 
In comparison with the next preceding portable examination , the findings have cleared up markedly . 
In particular the basal bilateral densities strongly suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 1 1 - 2 1 * * ] , have now practically cleared completely , as both lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient in upright position . 
Also , the parenchymal densities have regressed ; however , significant residuals remain on both sides . 
These consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densities close to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourth rib . 
On the left side these parenchymal densities are also in peripheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying the second and third ribs including the corresponding interspace . 
In comparison with the preceding single view examination , it is possible that these parenchymal densities have progressed slightly and thus , further followup chest examinations in this patient with history of lymphoma is recommended . 
Widespread peripheral consolidations which are new or increasing . 
These are not entirely specific , but the striking peripheral character of consolidations is very suggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia , either of which could be associated with a drug reaction . 
The appearance would be much less typical for an infectious etiology or progression of lymphoma , which has apparently responded overall very well to treatment . 
New mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertain significance . 
Correlation with liver function tests is recommended . 
If the apppearance may be clinically significant based on laboratory data or clinical presentation , then MRCP could be considered or follow - up CT or ultrasound . 
Extrinsic compression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this study is a possible , though somewhat unusual , possibility . 
No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease . 
MR ( if feasible ) would be more sensitive than CT for detection of metastatic lesions . 
No acute intracranial process . 
Mediastinal position , contour , and width are unremarkable and stable . 
The abnormalities demonstrated on prior chest radiograph and chest CT appears to be grossly unchanged except for may be minimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe and right upper superficial area as well as interval development of minimal amount of pleural effusion on the right . 
The finding continues to be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broad including eosinophilic pneumonia , cryptogenic organizing pneumonia , drug reaction , and less likely infection . 
PATHOLOGY : [ * * 1 1 - 1 7 * * ] Bone marrow biopsy - MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT BY A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER , MOST CONSISTENT WITH DIFFUSE LARGE B - CELL LYMPHOMA . 
Correlation with concurrent bone marrow biopsy ( S 1 0 - 4 8 3 0 7 G ) is recommended . 
Initial labs in the ED were remarkable for lactic acidosis with HCO 3 of 1 5 and a lactate of 7 . 9 . 
On the medical floor , he was found to have a uric acid of 1 3 . 5 and an LDH of 6 0 4 in the setting of normal calcium / phosphate / potassium . 
He was started on allopurinol and IVF due to concern for TLS . 
A heme - onc consult was called and an axillary LN biopsy showed prelimary path c / w aggressive lymphoma . 
Bone marrow biopsy eventually showed diffuse large B cell lymphoma . 
Patient was noted to have increased work of breathing with ABG showing worsening acidosis 7 . 3 2 / 1 9 / 1 1 1 and lactate of 1 1 . 4 . 
A bicarb drip was initiated and due to concern for worsening lactic acidosis , patient was transferred to the ICU . 
Lactic acidosis was attributed to tumor mass necrosis vs . infection and patient was started on vanc / zosyn / azithro for pneumonia visualized on CT chest ( see below ) . 
He received [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] for treatment of his lymphoma and tumor lysis labs were monitored q 6 given his spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome on admission . 
He received rasburicase for persistently elevated uric acid and new renal failure ( creatinine 1 . 3 from 1 . 0 ) with improvement of his symptoms . 
He became fluid overloaded and was diuresed with lasix . 
He was called out to the floor where he received a round of RCHOP with good effect and no subsequent tumor lysis . 
He had some mucositis which was managed with pain medications and mouth care . 
He was discharged home on D 5 RCHOP with follow up scheduled in the 7 [ * * Hospital Ward Name 1 8 2 6 * * ] outpatient clinic and a plan to establish care in NY with Dr . [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 2 5 1 3 9 * * ] ( appointment tentatively scheduled for [ * * 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] ) . 
He was started on vanco / zosyn / azithro and was continued on these antibiotics for 7 days after he was no longer neutropenic per pulmonary recommendations . 
Repeat imaging with CT scan showed widespread peripheral consolidations concerning for an inflammatory etiology such as eosinophilic pneumonia or organizing pneumonia , but ultimately attributed to resolving pneumonia in the setting of a reconstituted immune system as the patient was asymptomatic and appeared well . 
Patient will need repeat imaging in [ * * 1 2 - 2 2 * * ] weeks after discharge to assess progression . 
Dermatology was consult and attributed the former to a resolving drug reaction and that latter to a contact dermatitis . 
Triamcinolone was applied topically to the plaque with gradual improvement . 
Fluid retention : Patient received fluids as part of his chemotherapy regimen . 
His weight increased 1 0 lbs over several days secondary to fluid retention . 
He was diuresed with good effect and subsequently reaccumulated fluid in his legs with the second round of chemo . 
He was restarted on lasix and sent home to continue diuresis with f / u in the outpatient clinic . 
Headache : Patient complained of mild intermittent R retro - orbital pain without associated visual changes , diploplia , or floaters . 
Was seen by opthalmology who attributed his eye symptoms to dry eyes . 
CT head w / and w / o contrast was negative for bleeds and metastatic disease . 
His pain was managed with lidocaine patches and oxycodone / oxycontin . 
BPH : No active issues . 
Patient was continued on finasteride and tamsulosin as his home BPH medications were not on formulary .

Brief Hospital Course : This is an 8 6 yo woman with dementia and h / o recent left MCA stroke complicated by persistent aphasia and hemiparesis admitted with acute hematocrit drop and guaiac positive stool . 
Hemolysis work - up was negative . 
Acute drop in Hct was thought to be from GI source . 
Pt ' s Hct bumped appropriately with 2 u RBC transfusions , and she was monitored for 1 day in MICU , where she remained hemodynamically stable . 
GI was consulted , and given her family ' s desire for minimal intervention , she was managed conservatively with PPI , Hct checks , and PRN transfusions . 
She was also taken off ASA ppx for stroke , in setting of GIB . 
Although labs do not show iron deficiency , she was supplemented as she may continue to have GIB . 
Her Hct remained stable at ~ 2 5 on day of discharge . 
She should have her hematocrit checked on the day after discharge . 
Her hematocrit should be regularly monitored afterwards according to her attending doctor ' s discretion , but we would advise that another Hematocrit be checked this [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 2 9 7 4 * * ] , [ * * 1 0 - 2 * * ] , and that she be transfused as needed to keep her Hct at baseline ~ 2 5 .

IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS . 
SMEAR REVIEWED ; RESULTS CONFIRMED . 
Brief Hospital Course : 7 6 y . o woman with PMH of IPF , COPD , anemia , mechanical mitral valve , and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea , acute renal failure , and fluid overload . 
Anemia : On admission hemoglobin of 4 . 6 and hematocrit of 1 4 . 2 from a hgb 1 0 and hct 3 3 . 1 within the last several weeks . 
Hemolysis labs negative , and rectal exam showed guiac positive brown stool . 
Her anemia was believed to be secondary to a GI bleed . 
She was transfused 4 units total with appropriate hct response , and her hct / hgb ramined stable . 
She underwent EGD / colonoscopy which showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp in the colon , concerning for malignancy which was believed to be the source of bleeding . 
On biopsy , this lesion was found to be an adenoma with high grade dysplasia . 
Gastroenterology believed that it would be possible to perform a transluminal resection but that the procedure would have high risk of perforation and death . 
After a goals of care discussion with the [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] health care proxy , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 5 1 5 5 * * ] , and the gastroenterology team it was decided that though the adenoma is high risk for malignancy , she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonary disease in the next 1 - 5 years and removal of the mass is not in line with her goals of care . 
She was started on nadolol for esophageal varaces . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Obtain 2 x weekly HCTs and transfuse for HCT < 2 1 - - Continue Fe supplementation and epo administration . 
Hypoxemic respiratory failure : The patient presented on 5 L trans - trach from a baseline of 4 L at home in the setting of known IPF , COPD , and chronic heart failure . 
Her dyspnea was attributed to anemia vs fluid overload from CHF , and remained stable in - house and gradually improved upon discharge from the ICU . 
There was low suspicion for a COPD or IPF exacerbation . 
She was given IV Torsemide for diuresis with her packed red cell transfusions , and her home Bumex was held in - house . 
Her home prednisone and nebulizers were continued in - house . 
Related to her shortness of breath , she occassionally coughed up " blood balls " , which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating at her catheter site . 
These were inconsistent , and associated with epistaxis , and we believed that there was a component of bloody post - nasal drip contributing , exacerbated by the fact that she was on a heparin gtt for her heart valve . 
The total blood loss from these episodes was essentially non - contributory . 
On the floor , she continued to be dyspneic at times . 
She was found to have evidence of a RUL HAP , so she was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime . 
She developed progressive respiratory distress and returned the MICU where she was intubated . 
She underwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative and her antibiotics were discontinued on [ * * 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] . 
She continued to be intermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatinine bumped from 1 . 8 to 2 . 7 . 
She was extubated and returned to the medical floor with o 2 sats 9 5 % on 2 LNC The thought is that her respiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug and pulmonary edema . 
After two days on the medical floor , she pulled out a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds , aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia and acidemia . 
She was transferred to the MICU for a third time where she was again intubated . 
Out of concern for HCAP the pt was started on vanc / [ * * Last Name ( un ) 2 8 3 0 * * ] . 
Due to increasing wbc and decreased stool output there was also concern for c . diff , which ultimately was positive , and the pt was started on flagyl / PO vanc . 
The pt ' s respiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated . 
Vancomycin was discontinued on [ * * 1 0 - 3 0 * * ] with plan to complete a total of 8 d of meropenem . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Continue meropenem thru [ * * 1 1 - 3 * * ] . 
She was empirically started on IV flagyl and PO vanco which were continued when stool culture was positive for c . diff . 
Pt had subsequent decreased in WBC to normal with improvement in loose stools . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Plan to complete PO vancomycin 1 2 5 mg PO Q 6 hrs as well as Flagyl 5 0 0 mg Q 8 hrs ; end date [ * * 1 1 - 9 * * ] . 
Patient presented with an INR of 1 0 for unclear reasons . 
She received 5 mg PO Vit K , and her INR down - trended to the sub - therapeutic range and she was started on a Heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve . 
She experienced epistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of a slightly supratherapeutic PTT which resolved with decreasing her Heparin gtt . 
She was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on the medicine floor . 
When the decision was made to pursue endomucosal resection of her adenoma , her warfarin was discontinued , however given this was put on hold , the pt was restarted on coumadin [ * * 1 0 - 2 9 * * ] . 
At time of discharge patient remained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3 mg daily ; INR on day of discharge 1 . 9 OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - COntinue hep gtt and coumadin until INR therapeutic ( 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 ) . 
Patient with oscillating renal function in house . 
Urine lytes showed were consistent with hypovolemia . 
Initially Bumex was held and she was given IV hydration . 
Creatinine increased from 1 . 8 - 2 . 7 in the setting of diuresis ( as above ) and bumex was held . 
During hospital stay patient was intermittently diuresised and prior to discharge restarted on PO Bumex 5 mg daily with creatinine of 1 . 7 . 
Weight at time of discharge : 6 2 . 4 kg ; sating > 9 5 % on 5 L NC . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Pleae continue Bumex 5 mg PO daily ; monitor weights daily as well as renal function ; may consider increasing bumex to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] or transitioning to IV if weight increases > 3 lb . 
Newly diagnosed . 
Patient placed on nadolol 1 0 mg daily . 
Patient largely hypotensive to normotensive in house . 
Decision made to hold home amlodipine 5 mg daily as well as spironolactone 5 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] at time of discharge . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Close hemodynamic monitoring ; plan to re - initiate anti - hypertensives if needed . 
Patient with transtracheal O 2 catheter as well as use of chronic steriods as an outpatient . 
During 1 st intubation transtracheal cath was removed . 
In house patient received stress dose steriods which were weanted to home prednisone 1 0 mg daily at time of discharge . 
OUTPATIENT ISSUES : - - Continue chronic prednisone ; consider need for PCP [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) * * ] [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) * * ] Continue discussion re replacement of transtracheal cath . 
Patient noted to be intermittently hypernatremic when NPO / intubated . 
Received free water boluses thru NGT as well as IV D 5 with improvement . 
Na at time of discharge 1 5 2 OUTPATIENT - - Continue monitoring of electrolytes ; encourage PO intake and adminster D 5 W if needed ( however by cautious in setting of known diastolic CHF ) . 
The decision was made to forgo aggressive management of the colonic adenoma as her life expectancy with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( which she has suffered with for ~ 8 years ) is now less than 5 years and likely less than one . 
The family wanted the patient to remain full code and to have aggressive management of her pulmonary disease . 
C . Difficile infection - - Continue on flagyl and PO vanc for planned 1 0 d course ; end date : [ * * 1 1 - 9 * * ] . 
Congestive Heart Failure - - Continue PO Bumex 5 mg daily ; monitor weights as well as renal function with weekly chem 1 0 panel . 
Mitral Valve Replacement ; goal INR 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 - - Continue hep gtt until bridged with coumadin , 3 mg daily , to a therapeutic INR . 
Colonic Polyp ; GI bleed - - Please check twice weekly hematocrit check with plan to transfuse if < 2 4 . 
Arrythmia - - Restarting home dofetilide on discharge ; primary cardiologist aware . 
Hypernatremia - - Patient with improved PO intake in days leading up to discharge however sodiums borderine in 1 4 0 s - 1 5 0 s .

Discharge Instructions : Dear Ms [ * * Known lastname * * ] it was a pleasure taking care of you . 
You were admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for evaluation of GI bleed and while in house you developed respiratory compromise requiring intubation . 
Regarding the GI bleed , you were seen by our team of GI doctors who performed a colonscopy . 
During the procedure a colonic lesion was seen and a plan was devised to proceed for excisional biopsy . 
You were transfused RBCs as needed and your blood counts were monitored closely . 
After discussion with your family the decision to undergo biopsy was deferred to the outpatient setting . 
While in house your breathing became labored on several occassions which required intubation twice . 
The cause of the distress included aspiration and possible pneumonia . 
You were started on antibiotics with a plan to complete an 8 d course . 
Your transtracheal catheter was removed with plan to discuss replacement as an outpatient . 
At time of discharge you were oxygenating well using supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula .

Later that day he was transferred to the floor . 
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility . 
On post operative day two he had episodes of nausea treated with antiemtics and then short episode of confusion so his narcotics were stopped and he was placed on ultram for pain management with good effect . 
Due to increased creatinine to 2 . 1 his lasix and metformin were stopped , and lantus was increased for blood glucose management .

Transferred from OSH . 
Pt reports that on day of admission , he woke up with malaise , nausea , vomiting , fevers , and rigors . 
On transfer , he was started on zosyn / levo / flagyl , was hemodynamically unstable , was intubated prior to ERCP . 
ERCP showed no obstruction , no stones , some biliary sludging only ( normal cholangiogram ) . 
A stent was placed in the CBD . 
He continued to by hypotensive / unstable post ERCP , was found to have an evolving NSTEMI ( tnt leak , 2 mm ST depre in v 3 - v 6 ; peak tnt 1 . 8 , now trended down ) . 
He remained intubated . 
SWAN on [ * * 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] showed PCWP 3 5 , BP 9 5 / 4 3 , FA = 2 2 , and the next warning , he went into rapid afib with decompensation requiring single 2 0 0 J shock . 
He was on 3 pressors at the time ( levophed , vasopressin , dopa ) , converted into NSR temporarily , was started on amio . 
He had recurrence of afib . 
DCCV was repeated 2 times without success ; he spontaneously reverted to NSR ( ? s / p DCCV on [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] ) has remained in this rhythm , and is on an amio taper ( drip ) . 
Cardiology is following . 
Etiology of this new onset afib was thought to be in the setting of volume resuscitation and acute illness . 
With respect to his sepsis , he required 3 pressors as above , was on vanco / zosyn / lev / flagyl . 
Blood cultures from [ * * Doctor Last Name 1 2 6 3 * * ] grew out [ * * 4 - 2 6 * * ] E . coli ( with E . coli also in urine ) resistant to amp / pip / sulbactam . 
Ciprofloxacin was added to regimen on [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] . 
He is currently just on cipro and is to complete a 1 4 day course for E . coli . 
He continued to improve clinically , was extubated on [ * * 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] , and he was transferred to the floor on [ * * 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] ( stable , mentating ) . 
Other MICU events include a drop in platelets following 4 8 hours of heparin therapy ( HIT negative , Hep d / c ' ed , and platelets recovering ) . 
He had a bump in his creatinine to 3 . 0 ( baseline 1 . 3 - 1 . 5 as per PCP ) which is resolving ( ? ATN [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] hypotension but no muddy brown casts on sediment ) . 
Renal US was obtained that did not show hydronephrosis or cause or ARF .

ERCP to evaluate for biliary obstruction . 
Level 3 consult was performed . 
Procedure : The procedure , indications , preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient , who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms . 
The patient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached . 
Careful visualization was performed . 
The procedure was not difficult . 
The quality of the preparation was good . 
The patient tolerated the procedure well . 
There were no complications . 
Findings : Esophagus : Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach : Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum : Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla : Major papilla was located inside a diverticulum . 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification .

Small stone in CBD can ' t be ruled out . 
Opacified portion of pancreatic duct in the head was normal . 
Additional notes : The procedure was performed by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] ( attending physician ) and ERCP fellow . 
Brief Hospital Course : A / P : 6 7 yo male , h / o severe 3 vd , RA , presenting from OSH with ? biliary sepsis , s / p ERCP with stent placed , being treated for urosepsis vs biliary sepsis , extubated and doing well . 
Sepsis : The patient ' s initial picture was consistent with septic + cardiogenic shock . 
Initial SG numbers revealed high SVR , low CO , and high PCWP . 
He remained hypotensive despite IVF , and pressors were continued , with eventual triple pressor therapy ( Levo , Dopamine and Vasopressin ) required for hemodynamic support . 
A random cortisol was 2 0 , and 2 9 post - cosyntropin . 
Despite appropriate response , the low random cortisol prompted initiation of steroid therapy , initially Dexamethasone , then hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone with plan to complete 7 days of Rx ( completed ) . 
His lactate , elevated on admission , came down . 
He was successfully weaned off Levo and Vasopressin on [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 2 - 2 8 * * ] , then off Dopamine on [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] . 
ERCP did not show obstruction , ? biliary sludge . 
He was initially on vanco / zosyn / flagyl - - > cipro / vanco / flagyl . 
Vanco / flagyl were discontinued on [ * * 1 2 - 2 7 * * ] ( c . diff neg x 3 ) , and he will continue a course of cipro for ? urosepsis . 
All cultures here have been NGTD , but he is being treated for [ * * 4 - 2 6 * * ] E . coli blood culture bottles at [ * * Doctor Last Name 1 2 6 3 * * ] . 
Ciprofloxacin was continued for the 1 4 day course ( until [ * * 1 - 9 * * ] ) . 
He was hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization . 
Blood pressure medications were initially held [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] hypotension . 
Lisinopril was restarted prior to discharge after renal function improved . 
Atenolol was held given patient was still on amiodarone taper . 
This should be restarted after he follows up with his PCP / cardiologist . 
NSTEMI : The [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] hospital course was complicated by troponin elevation felt secondary to demand in the setting of acute illness ( peak troponin 1 . 8 6 ) . 
He received 4 8 hours of intravenous heparin , D / C ' d in the setting of thrombocytopenia . 
An echo was performed on [ * * 1 2 - 2 5 * * ] , which revealed severe global LV hypokinesis with EF < 2 5 % . 
Cardiology followed in - house . 
Lisinopril , ASA , were continued . 
Lipitor was added upon discharge at a lower dose , and atenolol was held . 
This should be restarted when amiodarone taper is completed and he follows up with his primary cardiologist . 
He also had an echo in - house showing a very depressed EF ( < 2 5 % ) , likely [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] myocardial suppression from sepsis . 
He should have a follow up TTE after discharge from rehab . 
Afib : Patient went into atrial fibrillation on [ * * 1 2 - 2 5 * * ] with RVR and hypotension . 
Cardioversion was attempted without success . 
He was loaded with amiodarone IV and an amiodarone drip was initiated . 
He converted to NSR in PM . 
Then , he reverted back into afib on [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] after an increase in dopamine dose to 3 ( ? true - true and unrelated ? ) . 
Given low cardiac output and ongoing hypotension requiring 3 pressors , cardioversion was performed with conversion to NSR after a single 2 0 0 J shock . 
The patient was switched to PO amiodarone on [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] , to be continued TID until [ * * 1 - 2 * * ] , then [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] for 1 week , then QD for 1 week , then 2 0 0 mg PO QD until cardiology follow - up . 
He remained in NSR throughout hospitalization after transfer out of the unit . 
His atenolol was held and should be restarted after he finishes his amiodarone taper and follows up with his cardiologist , Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] . 
He was started on fondaparinux / coumadin for anticoagulation ( afib and low EF ) . 
Goal INR is [ * * 2 - 2 4 * * ] , fondaparinux can be d / c ' ed when INR = 1 . 8 . 
ARF on CRF : Per patient ' s PCP ( Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] , baseline creatinine around 1 . 3 - 1 . 5 . 
Peak creatinine 3 . 0 at OSH . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was initially oliguric on admission . 
His urine output slowly improved with better hemodynamics , with slowly improving creatinine . 
Urine lytes suggestive of renal etiology ( likely ATN [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] hypotension from sepsi ) , and urine sediment bland . 
Currently 2 . 1 , and auto - diuresing and mobilising fluid . 
RUS without evidence of hydronephrosis or other abnormality . 
His creatinine returned to baseline ( 1 . 3 ) and was stable on discharge . 
He diuresed very well on IV lasix ( goal 2 L / d ) . 
He was discharge on PO bumex 1 mg daily . 
This should be continued until he is clinically euvolemic and his peripheral edema is resolved . 
Transaminitis : s / p ERCP with stent placement , but only finding of sludge . 
Query transaminitis in setting of sepsis . 
LFT ' s were back to normal at time of discharge . 
They should be checked within a week of discharge . 
Lipitor was restarted at lower dose upon discharge and can be titrated up . 
Thrombocytopenia : While in ICU , platelets were noted to drop to a nadir in the 8 0 s . 
Concern for HIT was raised and Heparin was discontinued after 4 8 hours of therapy . 
HIT screen negative . 
Picture no c / w DIC . 
Ultimately , thrombocytopenia was felt medication - induced , query direct effect of Heparin versus antibiotics ( vanco , Flagyl ) . 
Now slowly rising . 
This was likley multifactorial in the setting of sepsis , medications , pressors and not [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] heparin . 
Platelets continued to go up and were stable at time of discharge . 
SSI should be continued as long as pt has abnormal blood sugars . 
If this intolerance persists , PCP should recommend further therapy . 
Dispo : Patient was seen by physical therapy in house and was thought to require acute level rehabilitation for deconditioning . 
He was discharged to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] Rehabiliation for physical therapy and diuresis .

Mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
IMPRESSION : Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive regional systolic dysfunction most c / w multivessel CAD ( including proximal RCA ) . 
Right ventricular cavity enlargement . 
Mild mitral regurgitation . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 1 0 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] , global left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved . 
No obvious free air identified . 
However , the differential diagnosis for this appearance includes air within an abscess . 
If there is significant clinical suspicion for intra - abdominal infection , then this area could be further assessed with a CT scan . 
Brief Hospital Course : Hospital Course : 6 8 year old man with a history of coronary disease status post cabg in [ * * 2 1 0 7 * * ] and multiple PCIs , DM type II , hypertension and depression who presented initially on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 7 * * ] with weight gain at home and altered mental status . 
He had what appeared to be a possible seizure in the ED , resulting in dilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transfer to the MICU . 
He was then sent to the medicine service for several days while work up continued on his neurologic issues and falls ( work up negative ) . 
Then on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] , he began having chest pain , and echo showed new acute decrease in the EF from 4 5 - > 2 0 % with some apical and septal akinesis . 
Cath the following day showed severe native disease with 2 BMS placed in RCA , and RHC showed elevated wedge at 3 0 mmHg . 
He was intitially transferred back to the cardiology service for management , however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organ dysfunction ( renal and liver failure ) suggestive of cardiogenic shock , necessitating transfer to the CCU under the heart failure service . 
Given his renal failure , CVVH was initiated ( mostly for ultrafiltration ) . 
Despite full support with intermittent pressors , IABP , and CVVH , he failed to improve . 
On [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 1 7 * * ] , he self - discontinued his balloon pump , leading to rapid decompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer to the cath lab for IABP re - placement . 
He was able to wean off the balloon pump on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 1 9 * * ] , however his hemodynamics then worsened again , necessitating the use of pressors . 
Despite full pressor support , his status continued to worsen . 
Upon frank discussion with his family regarding his grim prognosis , they felt that he would never want to continue with aggressive care if there was little chance of full recovery . 
On [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 2 1 * * ] , they decided to transition his care to comfort measures only . 
He died peacefully on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 2 2 * * ] . 
Please see below for details on each of his major active issues : . 
ACTIVE ISSUES : # [ * * Date Range 7 7 9 2 * * ] / Cardiogenic Shock : On [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] while on medicine service , experienced chest pain with troponin of 0 . 1 , negative MB , but echo with new anterior WMA and EF depressed at 2 5 % ( down from 4 0 - 4 5 % ) . 
Cath on [ * * 7 - 1 2 * * ] showed 8 0 % ostial stenosis of the RCA , which was stented with 2 bare metal stents . 
Following the cath , he continued to decompensate . 
He appeared to be in decompensated CHF by renal status , crackles on exam , and mild peripheral edema . 
A TTE showed an EF of 2 0 % from baseline of 4 0 - 4 5 % in 6 / [ * * 2 1 1 8 * * ] . 
He had 2 BMS placed to his RCA , his LVEDP was elevatd at 3 0 , pulmonary pressures were also elevated so the patient was transferred to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 5 1 6 * * ] service . 
Despite aggresive diuresis , patient continued to [ * * Last Name ( un ) 2 2 9 7 7 * * ] clinically , with high filling pressures , low CI , low UOP and was transfered to CCU . 
Patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect ( could not do milranone because of [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] ) . 
He was also on lasix drip . 
Patient had an intra - aortic baloon pump to improve systemic perfusion and coronary artery perfusion . 
While in CCU a Swan - Ganz catheter was placed to monitor CO . Dobutamine drip was started in setting of low CO . 
The patient was also started on CVVH to remove fluid thought to be contributing to decreased CO as renal failure persisted . 
On [ * * 7 - 1 7 * * ] pt was increasingly delusional and removed his IABP partially . 
Decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggt d / c and pressure held at site . 
The patient ' s o 2 sats decreased at this time and lactate increased to over 6 . 
Decision was made to intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump . 
Ballon pump was weaned off of IABP on [ * * 7 - 1 9 * * ] . 
Howver he conintued to have high pressor requirements . 
However after the drop in his blood pressure and after his cath his Cr continued to rise and he stopped making urine . 
Renal was consulted who started CCVH to remove fluid to help relieve strain on his heart . 
CCVH was stopped when patient was made CMO by family on [ * * 7 - 2 1 * * ] . 
The day following cath , his LFTs sharply rose to ALT 1 2 0 0 and AST 1 0 5 9 , LDH 1 9 0 0 , TBili 1 . 9 . 
Concern was for shock liver vs med effect , Hepatology was consulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec ' d to hold atorvastatin , obtain RUQ U / S which showed possibly fatty liver with patent vasculature . 
The following day , he developed encephalopathy and lactulose was started . 
LFTs trended down throughout his hospital course . 
We also considered orthostasis given history of same vs . arrhythmia vs . seizure given possible seizure in CT scan . 
Patient was not found to be orthostatic . 
Neurology consulted and had a low suspicion of seizure . 
MRI with and without contrast was unremarkable . 
Neurology continued to follow and did not recommend AED ' s . 
IDDM : Patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi blood surgars well well ontrolled in the CCU . 
The family was in agreement that per past discussions they had with the patient , he would not have wanted a prolonged death and would rather be made comfortable at this juncture . 
After withdawal of all care he passed away on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 2 2 * * ] at 7 : 1 0 am .

Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you otherwise . 
Please call our office nurse if you have any questions . 
Dial 9 1 1 if you have any medical emergency . 
ACTIVITY : . 
There are restrictions on activity . 
On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your Surgeon . 
You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible . 
You may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots . 
But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site when transferring and or pivoting . 
Please keep knee immobilizer on at all times to help keep the amputation site straight . 
No driving until cleared by your Surgeon . 
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS : . 
Redness in or drainage from your leg wound ( s ) . 
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection . 
These are : a fever greater than 1 0 1 degrees , chills , increased redness , or pus draining from the incision site . 
If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site , CALL THE DOCTOR . 
Exercise : . 
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks . 
Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon . 
Try to keep leg elevated when able . 
BATHING / SHOWERING : . 
You may shower immediately upon coming home . 
No bathing . 
Remove it after this time and wash your incision ( s ) gently with soap and water . 
You will have sutures , which are usually removed in 3 weeks . 
This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow - up appointment . 
WOUND CARE : . 
An appointment will be made for you to return for suture removal . 
When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri - strips over the incision . 
These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on . 
If these do not fall off after 1 0 days , you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower . 
Avoid taking a tub bath , swimming , or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery . 
MEDICATIONS : . 
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery . 
You will be given a new prescription for pain medication , which can be taken every three ( 3 ) to four ( 4 ) hours only if necessary . 
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet . 
If you feel that you are constipated , do not strain at the toilet . 
You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia . 
Appetite suppression may occur ; this will improve with time . 
Eat small balanced meals throughout the day . 
CAUTIONS : . 
We know you ' ve heard this before , but it really is an important step to your recovery . 
Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation . 
If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible . 
Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation . 
Avoid pressure to your amputation site . 
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery . 
DIET : . 
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively . 
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small , frequent meals may be preferred . 
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet : Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood . 
Additionally , some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol . 
Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful , we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat , saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL ( Low Density Lipoprotein - the bad cholesterol ) . 
Exercise will increase your HDL ( High Density Lipoprotein - the good cholesterol ) and with your doctor ' s permission , is typically recommended . 
You may be self - referred or get a referral from your doctor . 
If you are overweight , you need to think about starting a weight management program . 
Your health and its improvement depend on it . 
We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy , and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude . 
If interested you can may be self - referred or can get a referral from your doctor . 
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance , you may request a referral from your doctor . 
FOLLOW - UP APPOINTMENT : . 
Be sure to keep your medical appointments . 
The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have . 
Things like high blood pressure , diabetes , and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels . 
Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow - up visit . 
This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge . 
Normal office hours are 8 : 3 0 - 5 : 3 0 Monday through Friday . 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure : 1 . 
Infrarenal tube graft repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm via retroperitoneal approach . 
Quit smoking 1 0 years ago , ? 4 packs per day for 2 0 years . 
No EtOH . 
Family History : Family history : Mother - deceased , stroke . 
Father - deceased , MI . 
Cognition , language , speech , voice : Awake , alert , but slow to respond , limited verbal output , appearing fatigued . 
He did follow one step commands , though inconsistently , with a delay and with visual cues / modeling . 
Pt ' s speech was intelligible and fluent , but responses were very limited . 
Vocal quality was breathy , though the pt could generate adequate voicing with effort . 
Teeth : Edentulous Secretions : Mild amount of thick , clear , sputum was stranding from the hard palate to the tongue . 
This was removed with the Yankauer catheter . 
ORAL MOTOR EXAM : WFL for labial and lingual symmetry and ROM . 
However , both labial / buccal tone and tongue strength were diminished . 
Palatal elevation was symmetrical . 
Gag was absent . 
SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT : PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with ice chips , thin liquids ( tsp , cup ) , purees ( tsp x 2 ) , and nectar thick liquid ( tsp , cup ) . 
Oral transit was minimally slowed though no residue was noted . 
Pt had a difficult time initiating taking any po ' s , so feeding was required however he would not open his mouth sufficiently to actually allow adequate boluses into his mouth . 
Laryngeal elevation appeared adequate to palpation , though he swallowed multiple times per bolus . 
He did c / o sensation of puree sticking in his throat . 
Overt coughing was noted with thin liquids and pt confirmed sensation of aspiration . 
No further po ' s could be assessed as pt refused any more boluses . 
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION : Pt is demonstrating overt signs of aspiration with thin liquids , but more significantly is refusing all po ' s , despite maximal encouragement . 
As such , beyond thin liquids the examination was limited by the pt ' s fatigue , delayed response time and refusal . 
Notes from discharge facility indicate poor po intake has been an issue , but the pt was on a full po diet so it appears that he was able to advance off of tube feedings . 
Unclear whether this decline is related to post op somnolence or possible toxic - metabolic issues noted per neurology . 
However , at this time , I would recommend the pt remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the PEG . 
We will plan to re - evaluate pt later this week , either [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 5 - 8 * * ] or [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 5 - 9 * * ] . 
RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 . 
Remain NPO with enteral nutrition and medications via the PEG . 
These are located in the right frontal and left occipital lobes with questionable involvement of the left frontal lobe . 
These areas are hyperintense on FLAIR , raising the possibility that they may represent T 2 shine through . 
However , these diffusion findings are new since the prior MR examination . 
Therefore , these likely reflect relatively new ischemia , although they may not be truly acute . 
There is no evidence of hemorrhage , edema , masses , or mass effect . 
The vessels appear unchanged , with a large right A 1 , and no detectable left A 1 branch of the anterior cerebral artery . 
Impression : Several areas of diffusion abnormality suggesting recent infarction . 
No evidence of hemorrhage . 
Chronic right frontal and parietal lobe infarctions are again noted . 
Marked periventricular white matter hypodensity is again seen most consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions . 
The ventricles are prominent and similar in size and symmetry . 
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated . 
IMPRESSION : No evidence of hemorrhage . 
Stable prominent ventricles . 
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW : I agree with the above interpretation . 
However , I am concerned that the CTA may suggest an arteriovenous malformation . 
There were numerous prominent vessels , arterial and venous , and no explanation for the hemorrhage . 
I discussed this concern with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 7 1 5 2 2 * * ] at 9 : 2 5 pm on [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 5 - 4 * * ] . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 4 - 2 5 * * ] no major change . 
Tolerated the procedure well . 
Had epidural placed for pain control . L renal cross clamp time 2 5 minutes . 
Pt was extubated on [ * * 5 - 3 * * ] . 
Pain is currently being managed with Dilaudid PCA and Bupivacaine epidural . 
The last morphine dose was at 4 : 5 0 pm on [ * * 5 - 2 * * ] . 
Possible AVM . 
To be followed as an outpt . 
Medications adjusted . 
Hx of HIT pos . 
When INR at goal , Fundaperinox was DC ' d . 
Pt with difficulty swallowing / G tube / pt on TF . 
AAA was diagnosed when pt was admitted [ * * 1 2 - 1 2 * * ] s / p right parietal subacute infarction as well as right intraventricular hemorrhage . 
Post op , neurology was consulted as the pt was somnolent with decreased speech output . 
Neurology consult reported that the pt may have toxic - metabolic encephalopathy related to post - surgical state and sedative medications being used for pain control . 
We were consulted this admission to evaluate whether pt was able to swallow safely . 
We evaluated the pt multiple times last admission with the last examination being a video swallow study completed on [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 2 - 7 * * ] . 
That study revealed a mild - moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time . 
After fatigue , he demonstrated reduced A - P tongue movement , moderate oral cavity residue , moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngeal valve closure , moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriform sinus residue . 
Pt was observed to penetrate both thin and nectar thick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thin liquids . 
Because pt ' s oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly , he was at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over the course of an entire meal . 
Per discharge summary from rehab facility , the pt participated in speech therapy , had a repeat video swallow study and progressed to a ground solid , thin liquid po diet while at rehab . 
However , his po intake remained poor despite stopping tube feedings and starting the pt on Megace . 
However , notes from rehab facility and extended care facility indicate the pt was solely on a po diet , not on tube feedings prior to admission here for AAA repair . 
EVALUATION : The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in the bed on VICU 1 1 . 
Cognition , language , speech , voice : Awake , alert , but slow to respond , limited verbal output , appearing fatigued . 
He did follow one step commands , though inconsistently , with a delay and with visual cues / modeling .

Trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion . 
This pattern may be seen in interstitial edema in a patient with emphysema . 
Brief Hospital Course : Floor course 1 : Pt was initially admitted to the floor service for further care of a COPD exacerbation . 
On the evening of admission ( [ * * 1 0 - 2 1 * * ] ) , pt had an episode of [ * * 7 - 9 * * ] left sided CP with concurrent SOB that improved with SL NTG . 
Pt ' s troponin and CK were subsequently positive ( 0 . 1 3 and 1 6 2 ) and EKG had lateral ST depressions so he was started on a heparin drip . 
A cardiology consult was obtained on [ * * 1 0 - 2 1 * * ] and further medical management was initially presued . 
On the evening of HD # 1 , the pt developed acutely worsening SOB with tachypnia to the 4 0 s . 
ABG showed 7 . 2 4 / 5 7 / 2 2 2 so he was transferred to the MICU for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure including noninvasive ventilation . 
MICU course : In the MICU , pt ' s respiratory status improved with noninvasive ventilation , continuous nebs , IV steroids , and lasix . 
Anxiety related SOB was also been an issue for which pt received klonipin . 
Pt continued to be followed by cardiology for his NSTEMI and had a peak troponin of 0 . 2 1 at 1 0 : 4 6 PM on [ * * 1 0 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Echo was done on [ * * 1 0 - 2 2 * * ] showing a LVEF of 4 0 to 4 5 % with severe AS . 
Pt continued to have severe respiratory distress requiring continuous BIPAP and persistent troponin elevation thought to bue due to secondary demand ischemia . 
A cardiac cath was not obtained as it would have required intubation which the pt did not desire . 
TPN was started for nutritional support on [ * * 1 0 - 2 4 * * ] . 
Pt was weaned off of noninvasive ventilation on the evening of [ * * 1 0 - 2 6 * * ] and has been having an oxygen sat of 1 0 0 % on 6 L NC . 
He was also started on an insulin drip on [ * * 1 0 - 2 6 * * ] secondary to persistently elevated blood glucose levels . 
Insulin drip was weaned off prior to being transferred to the floor for further care ; pt was continued on NPH and insulin sliding scale . 
Floor course 2 : . 
Respiratory - On the floor , pt continued to have good O 2 saturations ranging from 9 7 - 1 0 0 % on 1 - 2 Lnc . 
Pt was continued to be aggressively treated for COPD with standing and prn albuterol nebs , atrovent nebs , montelukast , azithromycin , and steroid taper . 
Pt was seen by pulmonary consult . 
From their recommendations , we discontinued atrovent and started spiriva . 
We also switched from azithromycin to bactrim . 
Azithromycin has anti - inflammatory properties , but there is still little good evidence for its benefit in COPD . 
Pulmonary felt that Bactrim would be a better antibiotic , in the the setting of long - term steroids since it has PCP [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) 2 1 1 5 0 * * ] . 
Advair was added the the regimen . 
Prednisone taper was continued . 
The taper is to be as follows : Prednisone 5 0 x 7 days , 4 0 mg x 7 days , 3 0 mg x 7 days , then continue with 2 0 mg . 
Klonipin which was given for anxiety was discontinued secondary to lethargy . 
Pt will follow - up with outpatient pulmonologist Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Known firstname * * ] . 
CAD / [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 0 2 4 1 0 * * ] Pt had a NSTEMI on [ * * 1 0 - 2 1 * * ] which was felt to be most probably due to demand but acute coronary syndrome could not be absolutely excluded . 
He was on heparin for 5 days and was d / c ' ed in setting of left subconjunctival hemorrhage . 
Since pt is just recovering from his COPD exacerbation , we felt that it would be safer to defer cardiac cath as an outpatient . 
Pt agreed with this plan and stated his wish not to be cath ' ed during this admission . 
Cardiology was okay with this plan and they plan to re - evaluate him in 4 weeks . 
In the meantime , pt was continued on with medical management . 
He was continued on diltiazem for rate control ( beta blocker not used in order to avoid it ' s bronchospastic effects ) . 
However , diltiazem was unable to be titrated up secondary to blood pressure intolerance ; pt ' s HR remained in 9 0 - 1 1 0 range . 
Pt was continued on captopril , but most doses were held secondary to blood pressure intolerance . 
For now , we will discontinue ACEi ; please add it back on as tolerated . 
Pt was continued on aspirin and statin . 
Severe aortic stenosis - Pt found to have severe aortic stenosis on echo during this admission . 
The plan to be have cardiac cath as an outpatient after pulmonary rehab for a formal assessment of the aortic valve . 
We avoided beta blocker and nitoglycerin . 
Steroid induced diabetes mellitus - Pt was continued on NPH and sliding scale . 
Oral [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 6 0 * * ] glipizide was added . 
Pt is on Metformin as an outpatient , but we did not restart that since pt may be at increased risk for lactic acidosis in the setting of hypoxia or cardiac ischemia . 
Please continue to titrate up glipizide and adjust NPH as indicated . 
We will continue diltiazem for rate control and hold ACEi for now . 
Please titrate up dilt for better rate control . 
If BP tolerates , can consider restarting ACEi . 
Subconjunctival hemorrhage - Occurred in setting of IV heparin and noninvasive positive pressure . 
There was slow resolution of the hemorrhage . 
Pt was continued on erythromycin ointment qid . 
Ophtho stated that it may take 2 weeks for the hemorrhage to resolve . 
After then , pt should be safe for elective cardiac cath . 
Should anti - coagulation be urgently indicated prior to resolution of hemorrhage , ophtho feels the hemorrhage should not be an absolute contraindication . 
Pt will f / u with [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic one week after discharge . 
Crohn ' s disease - Stable Pt was continued on mesalamine DR . . 
FEN - Was on TPN in MICU which was discontinued . 
Pt was continued on cardiac , [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] diet .

He initially sought care from his PCP after he had noticed that he had noticed increased bleeding from the site of a removed childhood skin tumor which had been severely pruritic , causing him to scratch it with a sharp back - scratcher repeatedly . 
The PCP felt the patient had an infected cyst and started abx . 
His PCP drew [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) * * ] CBC which showed 6 6 % atypical white cells and thrombocytopenia with a normal white cell count and hematocrit . 
He then ordered immunophenotyping which is pending , and sent the patient to the ED . 
On review of systems , the patient also notes more malaise and dyspnea on exertion over the last month , as well as intermittently blood streaked stools and melena . 
In the ED , the patient was noted to have no evidence of bleeding but labs concerning for DIC and tumor lysis . 
He was seen by the heme - onc consult fellow . 
He was given 2 amps of bicarb with D 5 W at 1 0 0 cc / hr . 
He was given 1 0 u of cryoprecpitate and transfused platelets .

He was treated with ATRA and subsequently suffered from ATRA syndrome with an acute elevation in his WBC to > 5 0 K . He had significant pulmonary leak . 
He was treated with ATRA throughout and received Idarubicin which had to be stopped secondary to elevated bilirubin . 
His blasts and WBC subsequently decreased , and on smear [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 4 * * ] his myelocytes showed differentiation with improving status of his leukemia . 
ATRA was continued throughout his hospitalization . 
As a consequence of treatment , his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome with his uric acid peaking above 1 0 , with a change an increase in creatinine to 2 . 5 initially and subsequently higher as described below . 
He was treated with allopurinol initially , and required a 1 x dose of Rasburicase which led to the resolution of his TLS . 
He was maintained on his allopurinol for continued treatment . 
His fluid balance reached a peak of 2 7 L positive secondary to his blood product requirement . 
He initially required a PEEP of 2 2 with FiO 2 of 1 0 0 % . 
Over the course of 1 0 days he was able to be weaned down with the assistance of CVVH for fluid overload to pressure support of [ * * 5 - 1 9 * * ] . 
His mental status was the largest obstacle to extubation and he was taken for tracheotomy tube placement by Thoracic Surgery on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 8 * * ] . 
He tolerated the procedure well , and was able to be transitioned to trach collar starting on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 1 0 * * ] for periods of time . 
He had acute drops in fibrinogen , increase in LDH and increase in bilirubin . 
He was supported through this with massive transfustions requiring 1 8 units of PRBCs , 3 5 units of platelets , 5 units of FFP , and 2 4 units of cryoprecipitate . 
He was intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 3 - 2 6 * * ] . 
His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage ( likely both ) . 
Due to his subdural hematomas , he was transfused to goals of Hct > 3 0 , plts > 1 0 0 , fibrinogen > 1 7 5 , and INR < 1 . 6 . 
Once the DIC resolved , his goals changed to Hct > 2 5 , plts > 2 0 , fibrinogen > 1 0 0 , and INR < 1 . 6 . 
He had a number of potential causes such as medications , central focus with his SDH , and hypertension to 1 8 0 making PRES a less likely , but possible concern . 
Also , his uremia given his acute renal failure . 
He required several doses of Haldol and intermittent restraints for safety prior to intubation , when he was put on midazolam and Fentanyl drips . 
He was treated with dialysis for a uremia over 2 0 0 . 
His mental status was the barrier to extubation as his vent setting were minimal at the point of weaning sedation . 
He was non responsive after 4 days off of sedation . 
A family meeting was held with his husband [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] , and the decision was made to take him to trach , with the goal of trying to improve his mental status with dialysis . 
This was thought to be in the setting of Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS ) and abdominal compartment syndrome . 
Also complicated by ATN in the setting of low blood volume and possible microthrombi during DIC . 
He was treated allopurinol and Rasburicase for TLS with good resolution as well as with CVVH initially ( 1 day ) for fluid removal . 
His urine output responded . 
Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of greater than 2 0 0 . 
He was treated with dialysis with a fall in BUN to 1 1 3 , however , he had a fever to 1 0 0 . 6 and cultures came back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 9 * * ] . 
He was ~ 2 5 L positive for LOS fluid balance . 
He developed elevated bladder pressures and decreased urine output . 
Surgery was consulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there was no need for surgical intervention ( as well as given his critical illness , it was not indicated ) . 
He was started on CVVH as above and had 3 L removed . 
His kidneys responded and began making 1 0 0 - 2 0 0 cc / hr of urine . 
His CVVH was stopped and he was allowed to diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone as needed . 
His HR did not respond to Diltiazem drip or multiple subsequent IV boluses of Diltiazem and Metoprolol . 
Cardiology suggested Verapamil , followed by Amiodarone . 
He was loaded with Amiodarone drip and bolus of 1 5 0 mg x 2 . 
He was cardioverted on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 3 - 2 2 * * ] and continued on Amiodarone . 
He got an extra 1 5 0 mg of amiodarone on [ * * 3 - 2 5 * * ] with minimal effect on tachycardia . 
He converted to NSR , and reverted back to atrial fibrillation . 
In the setting of controlling his blood pressure with IV medications he received multiple doses of metoprolol and labetalol , and he converted to NSR . 
However , [ * * 4 - 1 * * ] he converted back to rapid a - fib with RVR and required uptitration of his B - blockade and a diltiazem drip which was eventually converted back to PO . 
Neurosurgery followed along and he had serial scans . 
His hematomas had interval increased in the setting of the DIC ; however , not thought to be clinically significant . 
Neurosurgery preferred medical management with antiepileptics and reversal of his coagulopathy . 
Neurosurgery followed , and neurology was consulted . 
They felt that medical management and blood pressure control were the best means of treatment . 
The aerobic culture was speciated as Staph aureus . 
No peripheral culture was obtained on that date . 
He was started on Vancomycin / Meropenem on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 3 - 2 2 * * ] after spiking a fever to 1 0 2 . 5 . 
This was changed to Vancomycin / Cefepime the next day . 
Given the concern for translocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immune system , he was switched to Vancomycin / Zosyn on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 3 - 2 4 * * ] for better coverage of gut pathogens . 
Micafungin was added to cover for fungal pathogens . 
He had multiple sets of negative surveillance cultures , and his antibiotics were continued while he remained neutropenic . 
He had a fever to 1 0 0 . 6 on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 9 * * ] and cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were positive for GPCs in chains . 
His catheter was pulled and he was continued on vancomycin . 
No evidence of tamponade physiology was seen on the echo . 
His repeat echo showed that the effusion was actually a fat pad . 
He initially required 1 0 mg IV diazepam several times and started on a CIWA scale . 
On RUQ imaging for persistent elevation of his bilirubin , cirrhosis was noted . 
More than likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he had poor clearance of his bilirubin ( from reabsorption from pooled blood ) . 
His insulin coverage was briefly switched to an insulin drip , and he was subsequently converted to subcutaneous insulin based on his requirements . 
His overall clinical status continued to decline over the course of hospitalization , with evolution of multi - system organ failure including increased pulmonary ventilatory requirements , persistant renal failure , LFTs continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia ( initially MSSA , then VRE ) . 
He was given 1 dose of daptomycin for VRE coverage . 
Given his multiple organ failure , worsening ventilatory requirements and persistent altered mental status , a family meeting was held and decision made to focus efforts on patient comfort beginning [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 1 2 * * ] AM . 
The patient quietly expired on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 4 - 1 4 * * ] with family at the bedside . 
Of note , the patient was just admitted Thurs - > Friday for N / V / abd pain . 
During that admission , she had a CT scan which showed no cause for her pain . 
Gastroenteritis was presumed and she was discharged home after her symptoms improved with zofran and dilaudid . 
She reports that after discharge on Friday , she felt well . 
Then , this morning ~ 5 AM , abd pain woke her from sleep . 
The pain was diffuse , sharp and intermittent . 
She was able to get back to sleep after 4 5 minutes . 
Then , when her mom woke her to check her fsbg ~ 1 0 , she again noticed the abd pain . 
She slept most of the day , but did have 1 episode of nbnb emesis and felt persistently nauseated . 
She also took her temperature during the course of the day and it trended from 1 0 1 to 9 9 . 0 . 
Her mother thought she should go to the hospital because of the pain and vomiting so she went to Addison - [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] . 
At OSH ED , she received zofran 4 mg , dilaudid 1 mg x 3 , and 1 L NS . 
Her pain improved . 
She was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] because she was concerned she needed imaging , which couldn ' t happen quickly there . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] ED , initial VS 9 9 . 9 8 2 1 0 9 / 5 7 1 4 9 9 % on RA . 
First set of labs was inaccurate . 
LFTs were near baseline . 
RUQ U / S showed cirrhotic liver , stable splenomegaly , unchanged gallbladder wall edema and new to - and - fro flow in the left portal vein . 
She was given 2 L NS , 0 . 5 mg IV dilaudid x 2 , and 4 mg IV zofran . 
Stool guaiac was negative . 
Currently , VS 9 7 . 4 1 2 6 / 7 4 8 7 2 0 1 0 0 % on RA . 
She states that she feels much better now though still has [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] diffuse , sharp abd pain . 
Her nausea has resolved and she ate 2 box meals in the ED today . 
She says that she feels silly to have come to the ED again with most of the tests being negative and asks if she is expected to have abd pain / nausea / vomiting with her disease . 
She wasn ' t sure whether or not she should have come to the hospital and didn ' t know who to call to ask . 
ROS : + low - grade fevers , abd pain , n / v , fatigue Denies night sweats , headache , vision changes , rhinorrhea , congestion , sore throat , cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , constipation , BRBPR , melena , hematochezia , dysuria , hematuria . 
Finally , this patient has had a complicated course over the past 3 months . 
Briefly , she was admitted on [ * * 6 - 1 2 * * ] for a GI bleed - grade 1 varices without bleeding seen on EGD . 
She represented on [ * * 7 - 1 * * ] again with GI bleeding - EGD showed non - bleeding varices , gastritis , and portal gastropathy . 
She was admitted again on [ * * 7 - 1 2 * * ] for a third GI bleed - this admission she had TIPS procedure performed . 
Course was complicated by high - grade MRSA bacteremia requiring 6 weeks of IV vancomycin ( at rehab , d / t concern of IVDA and PICC line ) . 
She was then admitted from rehab on [ * * 8 - 8 * * ] for hepatic encephalopathy and again on [ * * 8 - 2 5 * * ] for hepatic encephalopathy and hyperglycemia . 
She is single , has 2 children ( one living with father , one with paternal grandma ) . 
Per rehab records , she has a hsitory of marijuana and heroin use .

History of Present Illness : [ * * Known firstname 1 7 * * ] is a 5 2 - year - old female who was transferred from an outside hospital after being admitted inearly [ * * Month ( only ) 2 0 5 * * ] with diverticulitis . 
The patient was treated withantibiotic therapy and then underwent exploratory laparotomy and segmental colectomy with primary anastomosis on [ * * 2 1 5 6 - 6 - 3 0 * * ] . 
She spent 1 0 days in the hospital postoperatively and was discharged home . 
She returned shortly thereafter with increasing abdominal pain and fevers . 
The patient had a pelvic abscess with an anastomotic leak and was taken to the operating room a second time on [ * * 2 1 5 6 - 7 - 2 0 * * ] for exploratory laparotomy and abscess drainage . 
Enterotomies were made during this exploration and they were repaired with interrupted silk sutures . 
The patient was given an end colostomy and mucous fistula . 
Postoperatively on [ * * 2 1 5 6 - 7 - 2 6 * * ] , succus was actively drainging from the wound . 
A CT scan was performed which showed extravasation of contrast from the bowel into the pelvis and out the wound . 
The patient was transferred to the [ * * Hospital 1 3 4 6 * * ] for tertiary care after that finding . 
The patient was initially accepted by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] and then transferred to Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 2 8 1 9 * * ] on the Blue Surgery service . 
The patient was seen in the surgical intensive care unit in on arrival . 
There was bilious drainage from the abdominal incision and feculent drainage from [ * * Initials ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 1 6 6 1 * * ] - [ * * Location ( un ) 1 6 6 2 * * ] drain that had been placed in the pelvis by the previous surgeon . 
The patient was explained the risks and benefits of operative procedure and it was deemed appropriate to operate as there was significant drainage and it probably would not be controlled adequately with nonoperative therapy . 
The grave situation was explained to the patient and the patient ' s daughter , and the patient agreed to proceed and signed a surgical consent for exploration . 
Bowel resection , diverting ostomy and requirement to leave the abdomen open were all discussed and a consent was signed . 
Postoperatively , her wound healed secondarily with wet to dry dressing changes twice daily .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS : 1 . 
Significant one coronary artery disease . 
Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two overlapping bare metal stents . 
Successful clousre of the right femoral arteriotomy site with a 6 F Angioseal closure device . 
The right atrium is moderately dilated . 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal . 
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild basal and mid - anterior septal hypokinesis , distal septal akinesis and probable apical hypokinesis . 
The remaining segments contract normally ( LVEF = 4 0 - 4 5 % ) .

COMPARISON : CT abdomen from [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 4 - 1 1 * * ] and multiple chest radiographs obtained in the interval between [ * * 4 - 9 * * ] and [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 4 - 1 3 * * ] . 
TECHNIQUE : Unenhanced MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper abdomen with subsequent 1 . 2 5 - and 5 - mm collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats . 
FINDINGS : Extensive widespread consolidations involve mostly the right upper lobe , right middle lobe , and right lower lobe but also are seen in left lower lobe and left apex . 
The consolidations are relatively high in density ( the left upper lobe consolidation is about 5 7 Hounsfield units in density ) , as are the right middle lobe and lower lobe consolidations ( ranging up to 5 0 Hounsfield units ) . 
The comparison of the lung bases with a recent CT abdomen from [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 4 - 3 * * ] demonstrates interval progression of the consolidations in the right middle and right lower lobe . 
The bilateral pleural effusion , although did not increase significantly in size , is still of high density ( up to 4 6 Hounsfield units ) in the lower portions of the lungs suggesting sedimentation effect . 
The mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged ranging up to 1 6 mm in right lower paratracheal area and might be reactive . 
Extensive coronary calcifications are noted . 
The heart size is mildly enlarged . 
There is no significant pericardial effusion . 
Minimal left pneumothorax is demonstrated , 2 A : 3 1 , seen in the anterior mediastinum giving the patient ' s supine position and might correspond to an apical pneumothorax demonstrated on the upright chest radiograph obtained the same day earlier at 0 9 : 0 9 a . m . 
Although the comparison between the chest CT and chest radiograph is difficult , the size of the pneumothorax is most likely unchanged and is small . 
The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates fat density left adrenal lesion , - 1 9 Hounsfield units , consistent with lipoma . 
The rest is unremarkable within the limitations of this non - enhanced study . 
Again note is made of the presence of contrast enhancement of the kidneys consistent with known failure and retained excretion of contrast . 
Contrast is also demonstrated in the renal pelvis . 
The vicarious excretion of the distended gallbladder is again noted . 
The bladder is at least 5 cm in diameter , although no wall thickening or surrounding abnormalities are seen . 
There are no [ * * Year ( 4 digits ) 5 0 0 * * ] lesions worrisome for malignancy . 
Degenerative changes are seen . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Extensive bilateral consolidations , right more than left , of high density that might be consistent with multifocal hemorrhage . 
The differential diagnosis in the presence of renal failure might include vasculitis . 
Hemorrhagic pneumonia might be considered in appropriate clinical setup . 
Small left apical pneumothorax , most likely unchanged compared to prior chest radiograph . 
Bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions , high in density that might also contain an element of hemorrhage . 
Extensive coronary calcifications . 
Still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicarious excretion of contrast the gallbladder consistent with known renal failure . 
Brief Hospital Course : 8 5 - year - old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s / p BMS x 2 in RCA on [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 4 - 1 0 * * ] , with post - cath course complicated by pulmonary edema , contrast - induced nephropathy requiring CCU stay with transition to cardiac service . 
Given concern for ongoing bleeding cath was deferred until [ * * 4 - 1 0 * * ] . 
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated 9 0 % occlusion of ostial RCA which was stented with two overlapping bare metal stents . 
Her chest pain occurred intermittently since the PCI with intermittent ST depressions in V 4 - V 6 . 
Nitro gtt was temporarily started for the pain , and she remained pain free after it was discontinued . 
Cardiac markers were mildly elevated , likely demand ischemia from anemia , and CK - MB was negative . 
She was treated with aspirin , statin , and plavix . 
Patient ' s metoprolol was restarted once she stabilized . 
She had an ongoing O 2 requirement and desatted to 8 5 % RA on am of [ * * 4 - 1 1 * * ] , for which she was transferred to the CCU and lasix gtt was started . 
Fluid was initially removed via CVVH ( as below ) , although once UOP improved , she was successfully diuresed with IV furosemide . 
Her [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] was held . 
Renal was consulted for poor UOP while on lasix drip and high dose diuril . 
Her creatinine rose and she was started on CVVH via L IJ line . 
After a few days , her UOP picked up and responded well to 4 0 mg IV furosemide boluses , so the CVVH line was removed . 
Other source could be GI bleed from external hemorrhoids . 
She received 1 unit of pRBCs and her hematocrit remained stable . 
CT chest was concerning for atypical pneumonia vs . alveolar hemorrhage , although pulm consult favored the former . 
ANCA and anti - GBM were negative . 
She received a 5 day course of azithromycin and a brief course of prednisone for possible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ( one day each at 6 0 mg , 4 0 mg , 2 0 mg , 1 0 mg ) . 
Her cough greatly improved . 
She was transitioned back to glargine as the steroids were rapidly tapered .

Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations : Because we did not identify the etiology of her G . I . 
We will discuss with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 2 9 8 7 * * ] this afternoon to recommend either regular colonoscopy or virtual colonoscopy . 
Colonoscopy [ * * 2 1 8 8 - 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] : Angioectasia in the cecum ( thermal therapy ) Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations : In patient care Capsule endoscopy . 
NG lavage was negative for any coffee ground material or bloody contents . 
EGD did not reveal any source of bleed . 
The patient also underwent colonoscopy , revealing a bleeding AVM , which was coagulated using thermal therapy . 
She will need a capsule endoscopy as an out - patient in order to assess for additional , non - visualized AVM in the small bowel . 
She was monitored with serial hematocrits , which trended downward precipitating transfusion with 1 unit of blood . 
Her anti - coagulation with Plavix and Coumadin was held for her procedures . 
After , she was re - started on coumadin with a heparin bridge to therapeutic INR , and her plavix was restarted after being held for 7 days . 
Her hematocrit was stable at discharge . 
She was discharged once INR was therapeutic . 
Packing was placed by ENT which was dislodged overnight . 
We suspect that a minor lac / contusion from NG tube in the setting of elevated INR precipitated this event . 
She experienced no further epistaxis during this admission . 
The patient is on a higher dose of Coumadin ( 5 . 5 mg ) to maintain this INR . 
Per discussion with cardiology , her anti - coagulation was not reversed . 
All anticoagulation was held pending her EGD , and she was started on a heparin drip afterwards .

Moving all extremities . 
Normal gait . 
PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation . 
Renal US [ * * 7 - 9 * * ] : 1 . 
Multiple bilateral hypoechoic renal masses , consistent with known metastases . 
Doppler ultrasound demonstrates rapid systolic upstrokes , with impaired diastolic flow , and elevated resistive indices . 
The main renal veins are patent . 
These findings most likely reflect increased vascular resistance secondary to mass effect of multiple metastatic lesions . 
There is no evidence for renal vein thrombosis . 
CXR [ * * 7 - 8 * * ] : Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low SVC . 
Mediastinal widening and right hilar enlargement due to adenopathy are stable .

Brief Hospital Course : 4 4 F with metastatic NSCLC ( brain , bilat adrenals , bilat kidneys ) p / w frank hematuria , anemia , renal failure . 
The bleeding was from renal mets and was localized to the L kidney based on blood seen coming from the L ureter at cystoscopy . 
The renal failure was believed to be due to a combination of ATN , mets , and contrast . 
Ultimately she was started on HD . 
The L kidney was embolized to prevent further bleeding . 
She is now HD dependent . 
Her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumonia and adrenal insufficiency . 
Ultimately , after a trial of dialysis , the pt opted to be CMO . 
However , when she did not pass over a weekend , she considered this a sign that she could live longer and possbily survive cancer . 
A family meeting was convened and an accommodation was achieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her of her anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration . 
That said , after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties with the dialysis catheter , another meeting was convened . 
Antibiotics were stopped again and the patient was returned to [ * * Location 3 2 2 5 * * ] with ultrafiltration . 
During an ultrafiltration treatment , she went into respiratory failure and passed . 
You were given multiple blood transfusions and eventually your hematuria stopped . 
You were found to have acute renal failure and eventually needed to be placed on dialysis . 
You developed pneumonia and received antibiotics for that . 
Finally , you received your first cycle of chemotherapy . 
Please take your medications as ordered . 
Call your primary doctor , or go to the emergency room if you experience fevers , chills , shortness of breath , chest pain , recurrent hematuria , dizziness , blood in your stool , dark black stool , or other concerning symptoms .

Brief Hospital Course : Transferred in from outside hospital and underwent preoperative work up . 
On [ * * 2 1 5 3 - 2 - 1 3 * * ] he was brought to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery . 
See operative report for further details . 
He received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics . 
Post operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management . 
He awoke neurologically intact , was weaned form the ventilator and extubated . 
He was started on betablockers , statin therapy and diuresed toward his pre - operative weight with intermittant boluses of IV lasix . 
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol . 
The patient developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count down to 1 0 7 , 0 0 0 , from 3 0 9 , 0 0 0 . 
HIT was sent and would return negative . 
He did develop acute renal failure with a creatinine rise to 2 . 7 ( from 1 . 1 ) and oliguria . 
Diuresis was held and creatinine would begin to trend back down . 
Oliguria resolved and the patient had adequate urine output prior to discharge . 
Cardiac rhythm became atrial fibrillation and the patient was treated with amiodarone and anti - coagulation was initiated with coumadin . 
The patient subsequently developed ventricular bigeminy and was returned to the CVICU . 
Lidocaine drip was started . 
This would resolve and the patient returned to the step - down unit . 
He developed erythema and tenderness around the left SVG harvest site and was started on po keflex x 7 days .

He was in hus USOH until [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 1 - 2 7 * * ] when he went to his PCP ' s with R sided pleurtic chest pain . 
He also had a resurangence of fevers to 1 0 2 - 1 0 5 and night sweats which he had had for 1 3 years , then stopped 2 years prior when he started HAART . 
CXR on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 1 - 2 7 * * ] showed infiltrate within the left upper lobe and an opacityl at the right heart border . 
He was started on Levaquin at that time . 
Then on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 2 - 3 * * ] , he went to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] [ * * Location ( un ) 6 2 0 * * ] with L calf pain . 
He was admitted with a DVT and multiple PEs . 
Chest CT at that time also showed multiple bilateral segments and subsegmental pulmonary emboli , consolidation vs . infarct in the posterior left upper lobe and anterior right lower lobe , multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules , and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . 
MDs there were also concerned that he could have TB as he had weight loss , fevers , and pulm nodules . 
He underwent bronch on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 2 - 7 * * ] which was " normal " . 
Cytology showedd atypical flora . 
Cultures / labs from there showed negative crypto ag , oral flora from the bronch , AFB smear negative , culture pending . 
He was started on coumadin and heparin and a second of levofloxacin . 
During this stay , he had no pulmonary symptoms . 
On discharge from [ * * Location ( un ) 6 2 0 * * ] , he noticed his Right leg now was tender , where it had not been before . 
He then was switched to a course of Doxy on [ * * 2 - 1 1 * * ] my his PCP . 
The swelling in the LLE diminished , but the right increased . 
He had no pulmonary symptoms until the afternoon on [ * * 2 - 1 8 * * ] when he began to become SOB . 
He came to the ED . 
In ED , initial vitals were 1 0 3 . 6 , HR 1 4 5 , BP 7 8 / 6 2 , RR 1 8 , 9 8 % - > 1 0 0 % on 2 L . He was complaiing of worsening SOB and pleurtic right chest pain . 
Code sepsis called , RIJ placed . 
Initial CVP was 7 . he was boluesd 8 L NS in the ED . 
Of note , his O 2 sat on arrival was 9 8 % RA , then 1 0 0 % 2 l in the ED , 9 4 % on 4 L NC on arrival to MICU . 
He was given 1 gram of vancomycin , 1 gram of CTX , and a DS bactrim . 
Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent . 
A ct chest revealed a left upper lobe opacity , subsegmental PE ' s , multiple B pulm nodules . 
Currently , he is SOB and c / o pleurtic right sided and posterior chest pain and bilateral calf pain . 
He has been having fevers to 1 0 2 - 1 0 5 daily with night sweats . 
Denies large weight gain ( he has had touble with weight loss since his MAC ) .

HEENT : NC / AT , PERRLA . 
Neck : Supple , JVP normal Pulmonary : Anterior reveals a three componet pulmonary rub . 
Cardiac : RRR , nl . 
S 1 S 2 , no M / R / G noted Abdomen : diffusly tender with voluntary guarding . 
VERY tender gastroc . 
Neurologic : A and O x 3 ; srength grossly normal . 
Brief Hospital Course : Assessment : 5 1 yo m with AIDS , recent diagnosis of PE , pulmonary nodules , fevers , and shock . 
His shock is most likely due to sepsis given his increasing WBC and low CVP making right heart strain from PE unlikley . 
Plan : # Septic shock : He seems to be in distributive shock . 
Most likely this is sepsis , given that he is immunocompromised with fevers and respiratory distress . 
Given his immunocomprimised state , he has many potential sources for sepsis including bactreial , fungal , and viral . 
Infectious disease was consulted who recommended continue treatment with caspofungin , azithromycin , imipenem - cilastin . 
Continue antiretrovirals and bactrim ppx . 
Unclear source at this point . 
So far all cultures NGTD , cryptococcus , CMV , and histo serologies negative , AFB x 3 , PCP stain , [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) 2 0 6 1 3 * * ] ag , negative . 
Pt was placed on Sepsis protocol . 
With frequent NS fluid bolus for CVP > 1 2 and pressors . 
He had episode of NSVT on arrival while on dopamine and was changed over to levophed , which he required for several days of his addmision to keep MAP > 6 5 . 
Given persistent hypotension concern for neurogenic shock secondary to autonomic dysfunction , Neuro consult was obtained who did not think that patient has autonomic dysfunction on initial assessement . 
Required significant oxygen supplementation initially but this was reduced by 6 days of hospitalization from NRB to 4 0 % by facemask . 
RL LENI shows DVT this admission . 
Given likely coumadin failure IVC filter was placed . 
Pt was started on heparin initially and then changed over to lovenox 1 mcg / kg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Heme onc consulted , started on heparin as developing DVTs through lovenox . 
Consider bronchoscopy only if this worsens ( currently stable ) . 
Continues to urinate to the point of hypotension despite IVF being stopped . 
Gave dose of ddAVP to see if can concentrate urine . 
Ambisome switched to caspofungin . 
They did not think that the pt has diabetes insipidus given that the patient has had normal Uosm and Una . 
More likely , this is consistent with a solute diuresis from the large amounts of fluid the patient has received during this hospitalization . 
It is unclear whether he is intravascularly depleted or overloaded , and his weight is up approx 6 kg . 
If he is making appropriate urine to previous IVF administration , would expect his urine now to more accurately match his input . 
With restriction on NS IVF , pt ' s urine output has improved . 
ID following . 
So far all cultures NGTD , cryptococcus , CMV , and histo serologies negative - on retrovirals , azithro / bactrim - imipenem dc ' d - continuing with vanco . 
Also with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process . 
Per Neuro ordered TTE w / bubble , no ASD or PFO - Daily CT showed no change ( needs daily CTx 7 day to assess no hemorrhagic development . 
Stable in amount and frequency . 
Is small amounts at this time . 
If decompensates of hemoptysis progresses beyond tsp amounts will need bronchoscopy and possible surgical consult . 
Also with nystagmus on exam concerning for brainstem process . 
Restarted on [ * * 2 1 7 3 - 2 - 2 4 * * ] . 
PPx : PPI , no pneumoboots , lovenox , increase bowel regimen given constipation , no bowel movement since admission per pt FEN : po diet as resp status stable Access : RIJ , R art line , PIV Communication : sister [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] Dispo : ICU until HD stable # Code Status : Full , discussed extensively with paitent and HCP , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] , his sister . 
The patient had a prolonged intensive care unit stay . 
He developed further progressive thromboses . 
An IVC filter was placed to prevent further pulmonary emboli . 
He developed ischemic bowel with thrombosis of celiac and mesenteric arteries . 
After extensive discussion with patient and his sister [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] , the patient was made care and comfort measures only . 
He was treated with IV morphine and expired peacefully on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 3 - 1 6 * * ] .

There is a history of colon cancer in her father . 
Review of systems is notable for a history of interstitial cystitis and arthritis as well as remote history of depression . 
She received an exploratory laporatomy with lysis of adhesions for a small bowel obstruction that was found to be the cause of her symptoms . 
See Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 4 5 6 8 9 * * ] operative note for details . 
Patient was intubated in the ED d / t inability to protect airway and aspiration . 
Bronchoscopy was performed after surgery and she was found to have very little aspiration contents in her lower airways . 
She was admitted to the ICU after surgery d / t intubation and need for neosynephrine for BP control . 
While in the ICU she was successfull weaned off neosynephrine , and required lopressor for tachycardia . 
She had a drop in her Hct to 2 4 and required one unit of blood . 
She spiked a fever so was given a treatment of cipro , vancomycin , and flagyl . 
She was successfuly extubated on POD 5 and experienced resp distress that responded with Lasix . 
She was transferred out of the unit on POD 6 . 
She had episodes of non - responsiveness on the floor for which she received several cardiac work - ups , psychiatry saw her and recommended discontinuing her narcotic pain medicine and her benzodiazepines . 
She also had a work - up with Neurology which included a 2 4 hour EEG , MRI and MRA of her head , and several lab tests . 
All of these were negative . 
At the time of discharge , she was stable and no longer experiencing these episodes of non - responsiveness . 
Neurology and her primary team felt that she was able to return to home . 
Physical therapy saw the patient and recommended home PT .

As we discussed on the phone , his antihypertensive medications need to be adjusted and the patient will be following up with you regarding this . 
He may benefit from Jobst stockings to reduce his symptoms of orthostatic hypotension . 
I will be ordering an EMG to assess his polyneuropathy and look for any evidence of superimposed ulnar neuropathy or cervical radiculopathy on the left . 
The EMG should also include RR interval variations and sympathetic skin responses . 
MRI of the cervical spine was also ordered to rule out any cord compression which may also contribute to loss of sensation in the legs . 
The patient does have a history of traumatic cervical herniated disk in 2 1 2 5 . 
He may also have had a left elbow injury at this time which can make him prone to develop tardy ulnar palsy .

Thank you again for referring Mr . Sandy Tuttle to our Neurology Department . 
He has had LBP for at least three years which is located in his mid lumbar region , non radiating , worse with standing . 
The pain had progressed such that he has a very poor performance status . 
He cannot stand but for a few minutes at a time . 
He denies focal wekness . 
He had an MRI of the LS spine 2 / 0 2 / 4 7 which revealed heterogeneous marrow concernig for an infiltrating process in his marrow . 
He has had an SPEP which was normal , he has had a bone scan which was negatvie . 
He does not have an elevated protein or globulin fraction . 
He was set up for a outpt BM bx to evaluate the marrow process , but the pain has been so severe , he was admitted for an inpatient work up . 
Of note he has longstanding anemia related to his CRI , perhaps anemia of chronic disease . 
He denies any weight loss , fevers , chills , night sweats , decreased appetite . 
He does report fatigue which has become progressive .

Denies IV DU . 
The pain has progressed to a significant level such that he spends most of his day in bed . 
He did have an MRI of the L / S spine which was negative except it did reveal heterogeous uptake in the vertebral and pelvic bone marrow . 
They raised the question of multiple myeloma or another infiltrative process . 
He does have renal insufficiency , but no other abnormalities to suggest MM . 
We still need a few key pieces of data to rule this out . 
Other infiltrative processes such as malignancy from elsewhere should be excluded . 
In addition , he has a hx of a positive PPD , unclear if he actually had active TB or was treated prophylactically . 
Thank you for this consult . 
Rule out other diabetes - related musculoskeletal syndrome .

She was admitted for induction of hemodialysis to prevent dialysis disequilibrium after receiving her transplant . 
In the ED , her vital signs were 9 8 . 3 , 1 1 8 / 6 2 , 9 0 , 1 3 , and 9 8 % RA . 
She received zofran 4 mg IV x 1 and was sent directly to dialysis before arrival to the floor . 
At dialysis she had 0 . 5 kg removed via a right tunnelled line that had been placed one week ago for plasmapheresis ( she underwent plasmaphereis to remove antibodies against daughter ' s antigens - - daughter will provide the donor kidney ) . 
Upon arrival to the floor from HD , she feels much better . 
She denies nausea or vomiting , and is looking forward to eating dinner . 
She denies chest pain , shortness of breath , or lightheadedness . 
ROS is positive for vertigo , worse with sitting and standing , that she says has been ongoing for three months . 
She says she was seen by ENT yesterday for evaluation of the vertigo and was prescribed acyclovir for ? Zoster infection , which she has not yet started . 
However , it appears the vertigo developed several weeks before she started immunosuppressants ( which she started one week ago ) . 
She denies facial rash or burning . 
ROS otherwise unremarkable . 
She lives with her son and she has four children . 
The patient denies any history of tobacco smoking , alcohol abuse , or drug use . 
Family History : Her grandfather and one of her uncles suffered from Bright disease . 
Her mother ' s sister died of breast cancer . 
Her uncle had a history of melanoma , which was metastatic . 
Her father died at age of 8 4 from congestive heart failure . 
Her mother died from a severe stroke . 
She underwent HD without complication and plasmapheresis to prevent transplant rejection . 
She received Rituximab . 
Her transplant was postponed to 4 / 9 / 9 because it seemed that she still had positive antibodies against her daughters kidney , this however , turned out to be not significant . 
She was continued on her immunosuppressant regimen ( cellcept / tacrolimus . 
She had an episode of fevers / chills and was temporarily on vanc / zosyn , however , the sxs resumed and her cultures remained negative . 
It was noted that she had a very thin posterior fascia and peritoneum . 
Therefore , the kidney was ultimately intraperitoneal in the retroperitoneal space . 
The iliac vessels were soft without significant plaque . 
The donor kidney had a single renal artery with an early bifurcation and a single renal vein and a single ureter .

Postop diagnosis was small bowel obstruction . 
A wound vac was applied to the lower portion of the incision that was opened . 
Despite the vac , the wound continued to drain serous fluid . 
The wound vac was discontinued and a gauze dressing was applied . 
Drainage stopped and a topical dry gauze dressing was applied as the wound healed . 
She remained npo with an NG tube in place .

Chest Radiograph [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 1 8 * * ] : IMPRESSION : Mild interstitial edema . 
Small left effusion . 
Ultrasound of Abdomen [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 1 8 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Enlarged and heterogeneous left kidney , consistent with given history of pyelonephritis , with a number of hypoechoic areas in the upper pole potentially suspicious for abscess . 
No evidence of hydronephrosis . 
Nondistended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to third spacing . 
No specific son [ * * Name ( NI ) 4 9 3 * * ] evidence for cholecystitis . 
The CBD is dilated measuring 0 . 8 cm without intrahepatic bile dilatation . 
Patent portal vein . 
CT Abdomen and Pelvis W / Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 1 8 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema , evolving foci of hypoperfusion , parenchymal necrosis , inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation . 
Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in the left lower lobe . 
In the setting of infection , these could reflect septic emboli or other infectious processes . 
Followup chest CT to document resolution is recommended . 
Bilateral pleural effusions and basilar consolidations could reflect atelectasis and / or superimposed pneumonia . 
Gallbladder wall edema , pericholecystic fluid and pericholecystic hepatic parenchymal hyperemia , unchanged from prior ultrasound . 
While these findings are felt likely reactive in the setting of other abnormalities ( particularly since the gallbladder does not appear distended ) , by imaging this is equivocal for acute cholecystitis , and therefore if there is clinical concern a HIDA scan may be considered . 
MRI Abdomen W and W / O Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 1 8 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and interpolar region of the left kidney , coexistent pyelonephritis is possible . 
Two small discrete regions of fluid signal intensity may be explained by necrosis , although abscess formation cannot be excluded . 
Irregularity of bilateral renal arteries though confidence in that finding is low due to motion and potential artifact - fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis can have this appearance . 
A repeat study of the renal arteries is suggested when the patient is more stable . 
Gallbladder wall edema is commonly seen with third spacing of fluid . 
Common bile duct dilated to 9 mm , but has normal distal smooth tapering and there is no evidence of cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis and / or consolidation at the lung bases . 
CT Chest W / O Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 2 2 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Diffuse ground - glass opacity primarily within the bilateral upper lobes . 
Differential diagnosis includes atypical infectious pneumonia , such as PCP , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) 8 4 6 5 5 * * ] pneumonia and pulmonary edema / hemorrhage . 
Bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right . 
Emphysematous changes . 
TTE [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] : Conclusions No thrombus / mass is seen in the body of the left atrium . 
A patent foramen ovale is present . 
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and global systolic function are normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation . 
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve . 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . 
There is no mitral valve prolapse . 
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve . 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined . 
There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 1 8 * * ] , a patent foramen ovale is seen . 
MRA Kidney W / and W / O Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Enlarged left kidney , with large , wedge - shaped areas of liquefactive necrosis at the upper pole and interpolar region . 
The areas of involvement are unchanged in size and appearance . 
While abscesses cannot be completely excluded , the presence of preserved capsular enhancement , and the absence of extensive edema or perinephric inflammatory changes is more consistent with multifocal infarct . 
Given the clinical presentation , MR findings are most consistent with multiple renal infarcts in the setting of pyelonephritis . 
Normal renal vasculature , with no abnormalities of the renal arteries to suggest fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis . 
Widely patent left renal vein without filling defect . 
Moderate left and small right pleural effusions with atelectasis . 
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 2 5 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities . 
CTA Chest W / and W / O Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 9 - 2 6 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No pulmonary embolus . 
No aortic dissection . 
Resolved right pleural effusion and persistent but now slightly loculated moderate left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis . 
Decreased ground - glass opacification in the background of persistent emphysema . 
Non - distended gallbladder , with no pericholecystic fluid or cholelithiasis . 
No specific son [ * * Name ( NI ) 4 9 3 * * ] evidence for cholecystitis . 
Persistent dilatation of the common bile duct without intrahepatic bile duct dilatation . 
No son [ * * Name ( NI ) 4 9 3 * * ] evidence for choledocholithiasis within the visualized common duct . 
Chest Radiograph [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 1 0 - 2 * * ] : IMPRESSION : Small stable left pleural effusion , with no evidence of pneumothorax . 
MRI Abdomen W / and W / O Contrast [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 1 0 - 4 * * ] : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No new areas of infarction within the left kidney compared to multiple prior studies . 
Areas of T 2 signal hyperintensity within the lateral interpolar region and upper pole of the left kidney corresponding to stable areas of absent contrast enhancement in addition to striated enhancement within the left lower pole . 
These findings represent features of both pyelonephritis and infarction . 
Small vessel vasculitis should be included in the differential . 
Resolution of right pleural effusion with decrease in size of small left pleural effusion . 
Brief Hospital Course : 3 7 year old female with acute onset thyrombocytopenia and sepsis likely secondary to renal infarction and pyelonephritis . 
Based on OSH non - contrast CT scan it appeared this was consistent with pyelonephritis . 
She was started on cefepime , flagyl and vancomycin [ * * 9 - 1 9 * * ] . 
With concern for worsening abdominal pain a repeat contrast abdominal and pelvic CT was performed . 
It showed severe acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema and evolving foci of hypoperfusion , parenchymal necrosis , inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation . 
Urology was consulted given concern for a need for acute surgical management . 
They suggested a concern for renal vein / artery thrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal necrosis in the kidney . 
MRI revealed no acute thrombosis but was suggestive of an acute infarction involving much of the upper pole and interpolar region of the left kidney without being able to rule out coexistent pyelonephritis . 
The patient ' s white count eventually trended up from a nadir of 2 . 5 to the 9 ' s and she was transitioned from cefepime , vancomycin , and metronidazole to oral ciprofloxacin . 
All cultures remained negative but she did complete a fourteen day course of antibiotics for a suspected pyelonephritis . 
Vasculitis was also considered as an etiology for her SIRS but no clear evidence for a particular syndrome was found . 
Her blood pressures stabilized and she was completely hemodynamically stable for > 1 wk prior to discharge . 
She did remain febrile despite negative cultures , which was thought most likely due to inflammation secondary to her necrotic kidney . 
Prior to discharge her fever curve had been trending down and she did not become more febrile after antibiotics were stopped . 
Cultures similarly remained negative . 
Repeat MRI of kidney was obtained to look for an abscess or closed space infection and was negative . 
Agitated saline TTE revealed a PFO , which raised concern for paradoxical embolization but work up for VTE was unremarkable . 
Severe pyelonephritis could also cause renal infarction but as reported above cultures never impressively reenforced a pyelonephritis . 
Similarly septic emboli were thought extremely unlikely given persistently negative blood cultures . 
Investigation for factor V leiden mutation was negative and no clear reason for hypercoagulability was found . 
The patient was nevertheless anticoagulated as the benefits of anticoagulation were felt to outweigh the risks . 
Therefore , she was started on coumadin and discharged on this as well as enoxaparin for bridge as she was not yet therapeutic . 
Renal function remained essentially stable after the patient was hydrated on her day of presentation . 
The patient will follow up in hematology for further hypercoagulability work - up . 
Most likely etiology of her thrombocytopenia was thought to be marrow suppression secondary to SIRS / sepsis . 
Ultimately her platelet count recovered and was normal at the time of discharge . 
She did receive one unit of platelets during an IJ placement . 
A BNP was 6 5 8 7 . 
An echocardiogram was performed with concern for cardiovascular compromise and it showed a normal ejection fraction , normal wall motion , and 1 + MR . 
It was felt the patient ' s pulmonary edema and effusions were secondary to fluid resuscitation . 
She had one episode of desaturation to 8 8 % when she laid flat in her CT scan . 
She intermittently required 2 Liters NC for comfort . 
Her difficulty breathing was felt to be due to her abdominal pain causing pain upon deep inspiration and fluid overload . 
Her pain was controlled and patient was auto - diuresing > 1 5 0 cc / hr upon transfer to the floor . 
She continued to auto - diurese on the floor and eventually came off of oxygen entirely . 
Better pain control significantly improved her respiratory function and prior to discharge her pulmonary exam was normal and she was ambulating without desaturations . 
CT showed a persistent , loculated pleural effusion , and given persistent fevers , a thoracentesis was attempted but as the effusion was steadily decreasing in size interventional pulmonology and interventional radiology thought it was too small to drain safely . 
As it continued to decrease in size and the patient WBC count and fevers were down trending this was not pursued further . 
She continued to have significant pain , so a morphine PCA , maximum dose of 4 mg / hr , that was started and the patient ' s pain improved significantly . 
It was assessed that her pain was consistent with post - embolization syndrome , which includes fever , abdominal pain secondary to the clearance process of necrotic tissue . 
Eventually she was reestablished on a regimen of morphine SR , morphine IR , and gabapentin with good improvement in her pain . 
She will likely need these for the next few months as her body clears necrotic tissue from her kidney . 
The patient did not appear volume down as her CVP remained high . 
It was felt that the tachycardia was due to pain , fever and the overall stress response of sepsis . 
The tachycardia improved to the low 1 0 0 s after the administration of the PCA and remained there through the day of discharge . 
Ranitidine [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] started and then discontinued when platelet count recovered as it was thought this was no longer indicated .

It is unclear exactly why this occurred but we suspect you may have some predisposition toward forming blood clots . 
Therefore , you have been started on blood thinners to prevent futher such events . 
You have been started on coumadin as a long term blood thinner , you are being discharged on enoxaparin , a blood thinner , while we await your coumadin level to be therapeutic . 
You will need to see a hematologist as an outpatient to complete your clotting disorder workup . 
You had fevers in the hospital . 
Because of the imaging findings in your kidney we could not rule out a kidney infection . 
Therefore , you received 1 4 days of therapy for a presumed kidney infection . 
You completed this prior to discharge . 
Your continued fevers and pain are likely due to an inflammatory reaction as your body breaks down the portions of kidney tissue that died . 
You can take acetaminophen for these fevers as needed . 
Unfortunately , this inflammatory reaction also causes pain , which we have treated with multiple pain medicines . 
You will need follow up with a primary care provider and coumadin clinic to follow how thin your blood is . 
You will also need follow up with a kidney doctor to follow your kidney function , a hematologist to assess you for a predisposition to clotting and help manage this , and a rheumatologist as some of your tests suggest a possible autoimmune disorder . 
We have scheduled these appointments for you . 
Your medications have been changed . 
You have been started on coumadin , a blood thinner , that you will need to take until your are told to stop by a doctor . 
Your blood has not yet been thinned enough by coumadin so you are also being discharged on ENOXAPARIN ( LOVENOX ) , which will keep your blood thin until your coumadin levels are adequate . 
When your coumadin levels are adequate for 2 4 hours you can stop the enoxaparin . 
You have also been started on MORPHINE sustained release and immediate release for pain . 
You should not drive while using these medications as they can make you sleepy . 
You were also started on GABAPENTIN ( NEURONTIN ) to help manage your pain .

COMPARISON : Head CTs [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 1 2 - 6 * * ] through [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 2 - 6 * * ] . 
TECHNIQUE : Sagittal T 1 , axial T 2 FSE , T 2 , GRE , FLAIR , diffusion , 3 D time - of - flight MRA sequences through the brain were obtained . 
FINDINGS : There are scattered periventricular and T 2 hyperintensities within the bihemispheric white matter . 
There is extensive T 2 signal abnormality throughout the pons . 
There is no acute infarct . 
Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum and vergae . 
MRA : The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal , as are the middle and anterior cerebral arteries .

Minimal flow signal within the proximal V 3 segment of the left vertebral artery is likely artifactual . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Scattered T 2 hyperintensities throughout the bihemispheric white matter and more extensive confluent changes throughout the pons may be secondary to severe microvascular ischemic disease in this patient with a history of chronic type 1 diabetes , end - stage renal disease on [ * * Year ( 4 digits ) 2 2 8 6 * * ] and poorly controlled hypertension . 
No intracranial hemorrhage , vascular malformation or other acute abnormality . 
Brief Hospital Course : 4 5 yo male h / o DMT 1 , ESRD , on HD , presenting with hypertensive urgency / emergency in setting of worst headache of his life . 
Head CT was without bleeding , and Head MRI / MRA / MRV was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous thrombosis . 
Patient initially refused LP . 
Since his headache persisted for four days without resolution and reported left eye blurriness , and left eye pain . 
Neurology was consulted and they thought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenon and less likely intracranial [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] . 
They recommended an LP to rule out [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] or infection given his vague symptoms . 
Fioricet was started to treat his headache . 
On day 5 of his hospitalziation , his headache resolved , however 2 4 hours later his headache returned during [ * * Doctor Last Name 2 2 8 6 * * ] . 
Given the non - specific headache , an LP was performed after patient ultimately consented . 
First attempt at bedside was unsuccessful . 
He eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy elevated opening pressure of 2 7 cm H 2 O . 
He notably had only 1 wbc , 0 rbcs , and negative culture , Cryptoccocal Ag , EBV and HSV viral PCRs . 
The headache persistently had an unclear etiology . 
The leading differential was vasospasm vs . migraine vs . HTN vs . ? HD related ( since it was more prominent on HD days ) . 
It was decided to discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil , as verapamil is more vasoactive ; this medication would help vasospasm , migraine , and HTN etiology . 
His headaches persisted despite these interventions . 
Pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may be helpful . 
It was felt that an injection would not be helpful , given the diffuse nature of his headaches . 
Fioricet was discontinued , as it did not appear to be effective any more . 
He was continued on full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn . 
His HTN medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this this would help his headaches . 
This moderately controlled his headaches . 
He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was controlled with reglan , compazine , and zofran , which was also thought to help his headaches . 
He was given a trial of high flow oxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache , but this was not successful . 
Of note , the patient was felt to be quite sensitive to opiates and benzos . 
On the day of his IR guided LP , he received 1 mg of IV Ativan , which decreased his RR to 8 and he appeared very sleepy . 
He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his HA , but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same sleepiness . 
He was not given these medications any more . 
Since the etiology of his headache was unclear , it was felt that placing the patient on a regimen that he could take at home would be the best for him , rather than IV dilaudid . 
Pain was re - consulted . 
He was started on low dose MS - contin [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and 2 5 mg topomax [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Approximately 3 6 hours after these medications were started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive to sternal rub only . 
He was given Narcan 0 . 4 mg approximately three times over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly . 
He remained in this state for nearly 7 2 hours . 
It was felt the patient was on too much sedating medication causing this deleterious effect . 
All opiates , topomax , and gabapentin were all d / c ' d . 
He was given an extra day of HD in hopes that this would clear some of the medication that has built up in his system . 
He remained hemodynamically stable and protected his airway . 
These medications should be re - started only if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution . 
He was not given any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol , 1 0 0 0 mg q 8 H . 
Surprisingly , tylenol by itself appeared to control his headaches in the days leading up to discharge . 
He was headache free in the last 2 4 hours of his admission . 
It is truly unclear what the cause of his headaches are . 
It is still speculated that HD may be the cause , as small studies have demonstrated HD may cause headaches . 
It is unclear what the treatment for this is . 
Also , HTN headaches did not show a clear pattern , it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideally controlled , his headaches have cleared . 
Nevertheless , his headaches have resolved for the time being and further follow - up with his PCP is in order . 
As a result , his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased . 
He began to take all of his anti - hypertensives everyday of the week , including on HD days . 
He continued to have very high blood pressures after this regimen . 
His BP medications were increased to maximal doses . 
A clonidine patch was added at 0 . 1 mg q weekly . 
He continued to have episodes of sbp to the 2 0 0 s occuring after [ * * Hospital 1 2 2 8 6 * * ] in the setting of a severe headache . 
He was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring . 
His MICU course was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with IV hydralazine x 1 and po labetalol , along with taking his BP medications . 
He did not need an IV drip for blood pressure . 
He was then started on Minoxidil 1 0 mg po BID . 
Near the end of his hospitalization , his blood pressure was lower than expected with levels in the low 1 0 0 s . 
Minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
It was also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch for several days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures . 
After consultation with renal on the day of discharge , his current regimen is as follows : - - Lisinopril 8 0 mg po daily ( To be held the mornings prior to HD ) - - Valsartan 3 2 0 mg qhs - - Carvedilol 2 5 mg po BID - - Minoxidil 5 mg po BID ( To be held the mornings prior to HD ) - - - Close follow up with his bp is highly recommended . 
His N / V were felt to be secondary to his severe headaches . 
His metoclopramide was continued , as was compazine and zofran . 
At times , despite these medications , he continued to have nausea and vomiting . 
This proved quite difficult to manage his blood pressure , as he would vomit his medication . 
Once this was controlled , his blood pressure and headaches , and eventually his nausea and vomiting improved . 
He was discharged on metoclopramide 5 mg PO TID . 
Further evaluation of this standing medication should be evaluated by his PCP at his next visit . 
On further questioning the patient reports his symptoms began on [ * * 2 - 7 * * ] after the ophtho exam . 
Neuro initially evaluated and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes . 
LP negative besides increased ICP of 2 7 mm Hg . 
Optho re - consulted [ * * 2 - 1 8 * * ] and confirmed complete CN 3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and complete ptosis of left eye . 
It was felt that this may be reversible , but if not , it can be surgically corrected . 
He will follow up with Neuro - optho in the outpatient . 
He was given half his standing dose when not tolerating PO . 
Pt continued on sevelamer alone ( phoslo discontinued ) . 
Of note , he was on a very high dose for HD patients ( 3 0 0 mg TID ) . 
It was felt this may have contributed to his somnolence . 
Caution should be made in the future if this medication were to be re - started . 
He was continued on a lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain . 
Since he has a history of suicidal attempts , a 1 : 1 sitter was attempted . 
Through the course of the day , growing concern that he would act on his ideations by the sitter . 
Psychiatry was consulted and felt he was not suicidal at this time , and the sitter was discontinued . 
He was continued on citalopram . 
Social work actively consulted the patient and helped him deal with his many social problems . 
He was pan - cultured which was NGTD at time of discharge . 
A chest x - ray did not show any acute finding . 
He was not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved . 
He has a left AV fisula used for HD .

We were concerned that your headache might be from a [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] in your head but the ct scan of your head did not show any bleeding . 
We asked for your permission to look at your cerebrospinal fluid to confirm that you did not have a [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] in your head , but you initially refused . 
We told you that if we miss [ * * Initials ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] in your head that could result in another larger head [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] later , possibly even deadly , and you said you understood this risk . 
We did check an MRI of your head to see if we could see any blood vesels likely to [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] and that showed did not show a source of bleeding . 
Your headaches eventually resolved after addition of fioricet , but then then returned in [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 2 2 8 6 * * ] . 
A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by interventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for bleeding or infection . 
Your nifedipine was also discontinued and switched to verapimil to help your headache . 
Your headache continued to persist . 
The pain service was consulted and a very strong medication , Dilaudid was suggested . 
We stopped your fiorcet as this did not appear to help your pain anymore , and gave you dilaudid for your pain . 
This helped your headaches mildly . 
We tried to change your pain medication to different drugs ( ms contin and low dose topomax ) , but this made you very sleepy for several days . 
We stopped all of these medications plus all strong sedating medications , such as dilaudid , gabapentin , and ambien . 
You were continued on tylenol alone for pain control , and surprisingly , this alleviated your headaches . 
You are advised to not take these sedating medications any more as it is very difficult for your body and kidneys to process these medications . 
On the day of discharge , you were headache free . 
Your blood pressure was also very high during this hospital stay . 
It appeared to be quite higher on your hemodialysis days . 
We continued all of your medications on your [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 2 2 8 6 * * ] days . 
We also increased the dosage of several of your medications as well as added new medications that are listed below . 
During your hospital stay , you were briefly transferred to the intensive care unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure . 
You were monitored closely and your blood pressures decreased . 
You were transferred back to the general floor . 
More blood pressure medications were added and your blood pressure became ideally controlled . 
Your new regimen is below . 
You also developed double vision which we feel is secondary to a nerve in your eye that is not working correctly caused by your diabetes . 
This may reverse , but you may need surgery in the future to correct this . 
You will be followed up by Neuro - opthomology for further evaluation of this . 
When you came in you also had chest pain , but we do not think you had a heart attack . 
You also had significant nausea and vomiting during your hospital stay . 
We gave you strong medications to help this . 
You eventually were able to tolerate food and medications . 
You will be discharged on a home dose of an anti - nausea medication , reglan . 
Followup Instructions : Please continue your [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 2 2 8 6 * * ] three times per week .

Pathology : [ * * 7 - 1 3 * * ] Flow cytometry : FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests ( antibodies ) were performed : CD 2 , CD 3 , CD 4 , CD 5 , CD 7 , CD 8 , CD 1 0 , CD 1 3 , CD 1 4 , CD 1 5 , CD 1 9 , CD 2 0 , CD 3 3 , CD 3 4 , CD 4 1 , CD 1 1 c , CD 5 6 , CD 6 4 , HLA - DR , KAPPA , LAMBDA , CD 7 1 , GlycA , CD 4 5 , CD 1 1 7 . 
RESULTS : Three color gating is performed ( light scatter vs . CD 4 5 ) to optimize blast yield . 
An abnormal population of events cluster within the blast gate . 
They comprise of approximately 3 7 % of all events . 
These ' blasts ' express CD 7 , CD 3 4 , CD 1 3 ( dim ) , CD 3 3 , CD 1 1 c ( dim ) and CD 7 1 . 
CD 1 9 expression is equivocal . 
They are negative for CD 2 0 , CD 1 0 , CD 3 ( and other T - cell markers except CD 7 ) , CD 6 4 , CD 1 4 and CD 5 6 . 
Lymphoid gated events are unremarkable . 
INTERPRETATION Increased blasts with predominantly myeloid markers , consistent with acute myeloid leukemia . 
Morphological review shows blasts ( ~ 5 8 % ) with high N : C ratio , rare Auer rods , scant paucigranular cytoplasm , irregular nuclear contours , and open chromatin . 
Findings discussed with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] on [ * * 2 1 5 8 - 7 - 1 4 * * ] . 
However , cytogenetics and other molecular findings are necessary and should be correlated for an appropriate current WHO based classification .

Brief Hospital Course : 6 6 yo M w / unrelated PMH presented to OSH , found to have pancytopenia w / blasts in smear , transferred and found to have AML on flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy . 
He underwent TTE which showed normal LVEF . 
He underwent bone marrow biopsy on [ * * 7 - 1 4 * * ] which confirmed diagnosis of AML . 
A triple lumen subclavian CVL was placed on [ * * 7 - 1 4 * * ] . 
He was started on 7 + 3 induction therapy on [ * * 7 - 1 4 * * ] . 
He tolerated the infusion well and his ANC fell to 0 on [ * * 7 - 2 2 * * ] . 
He was thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with PLT in the 3 0 s and was transfused as needed . 
He was also anemic and transfused as needed . 
Repeat bone marrow showed hypercellularity . 
Patient was started on MEC therapy and tolerated it well . 
His ANC remained 0 . 
Repeat bone marrow on D 1 4 of MEC showed hypocellularity . 
His counts gradually increased and antibiotics were discontinued , he had been on broad coverage with vancomycin , cefepime , and ambisome ( spent a lot of time in [ * * State 1 5 9 4 6 * * ] ) and remained on these antibiotics until he was no longer neutropenic or febrile . 
Counts continued to increase and at the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and WBC was 4 . 1 . 
Bone marrow biopsy on [ * * 2 1 5 8 - 8 - 2 8 * * ] showed no clonal cytogenetic aberrations and < 5 % blasts . 
However , skin biopsy for a purple - pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy was consistent with leukemia cutis . 
Considering his bone marrow response and the resolution of this rash , it was thought to be rseolved . 
He will followup with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] for futher treatment . 
Given the concern for hemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear , see below , Flagyl was added . 
Micafungin was added on day 4 after first spike given continued fevers . 
Pt . 
Patient clinically improved , but then developed high fevers , rigors , and whole - body rash , respiratory distress ( see ICU course below ) . 
He was pan - scanned again , and CT sinus showed sinusitis . 
Coccidio , beta - glucan , galactmannan , histoplasmosis , legionella , blood fungal cultures were sent and were all eventually negative . 
ID was consulted and suggested removing cefepime and micafungin as they might cause rash . 
He was placed on vancomycin , meropenem , and ambisome ( for aspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage ) . 
Patient had risen LFTs which eventually trended down . 
He improved clinically and antibiotic coverage was stopped on [ * * 8 - 2 6 * * ] when patient had been afebrile for several days and ANC > 1 0 0 0 . 
Beta glucan from [ * * 8 - 2 6 * * ] was > 5 0 0 . 
ID was consulted again and advised to recheck beta glucan , as it may have been an erroneous result , since he was asymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest CT from [ * * 8 - 2 6 * * ] , and also requested a mycoF / lytic culture . 
These results are to be followed up as an outpatient and no antifungal coverage or liver / spleen imaging were advised unlses the he spiked a fever , which he did not do . 
Bloody streaks were seen on stool , minimal blood in toilet . 
Platelets transfused , Hct stable . 
Bowel regimen increased and further BMs were guaiac neg and soft for the rest of his hospital course . 
CT abd / pelvis showed mild R hydronephrosis and proximal - mid hydroureter on [ * * 8 - 1 5 * * ] . 
Hematuria resolved as thrombocytopenia resolved , platelets were transfused for < 1 0 . 
F / u ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of increasing creatinine , urology was consulted concerning the hydronephrosis and advised that he follow up as an outpatient for a hematuria workup . 
On [ * * 8 - 2 0 * * ] , had urticarial reaction to crossmatched platelets that improved with tylenol , PRA assay positive . 
Thrombocytopenia improved without intervention as the rest of counts went up as well . 
Renal was consulted and considering FeNa of 2 . 1 , was thought to be due to AIN , although it is unclear which medication caused this . 
He did have a drug rash earlier in his hospital course , thought to be related to micafungin or meropenem , but it is unclear what caused the AIN . 
He will followup with renal service as an outpatient . 
MRI T and C spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for CNS spread of disease , in addition LP was done . 
No lesions on MRI and no evidence of CNS disease . 
Numbness may be [ * * 1 2 - 2 7 * * ] ulnar neuropathy , he will follow up in neurology clinic and may get an EMG . 
ICU Course ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 2 9 6 3 8 * * ] ) Hypoxia : Pt with increased O 2 demand and some respiratory distress which lead to his brief transfer from the onc service to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] . 
Pt was initially given nebs , changed from NC to facemask , and given IV lasix . 
He was redosed with lasix with good urine output . 
CXR showed no change and ECHO was obtained . 
Pt O 2 requirement stabilized and he was titrated down to lower dose nasal cannula . 
Febrile Neutropenia : Temp of 1 0 1 . 4 at time of ICU transfer . 
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated LFTs raised concern over the administration of fluconazole . 
Because of the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemic regions it was determined to treat emperically with Ambisome so this was started and Fluconazole D / Ced . 
Near the end of the first Ambisome infusion pt spiked a fever above 1 0 4 and had chills / rigors . 
This calmed down with demerol and tylenol and was thought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause . 
Pancytopenia : This was thought [ * * 1 2 - 2 7 * * ] to AML and chemo with Hgb low on ICU presentation . 
Over brief ICU course 1 unit of PRBC was initially given followed by 2 units PRBC the next day . 
Pt had mild temp at time of beginning of the 2 nd transfusion but it was administered in spite of this . 
Hct responded appropriately to these infusions .

Discharge Instructions : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 8 6 9 0 3 * * ] , you were admitted to the [ * * Hospital 1 8 2 7 * * ] because you had low blood count . 
We obtained a bone marrow biopsy which showed that you had acute myelogenous leukemia . 
You were started on chemotherapy . 
Your cell counts dropped as expected , and you developed a fever . 
We did CT scans of your sinus , chest , and abdomen to look for a source of infeciton . 
We treated you with many antibiotics . 
One of the antibiotics gave you a rash , which resolved after we stopped it . 
You had a repeat bone marrow biopsy which still showed leukemia , so you underwent a second round of chemotherapy . 
While you white blood cell counts were at their nadir , you have difficulty breathing and spiked high fevers with rigors for many days . 
We continued with medications to treat bacterial or fungal infections . 
You eventually got better and did not have any more fevers and your white blood cell counts increased ( including neutrophil count ) and we stopped your antibiotics . 
We did a final bone marrow biopsy which showed < 5 % blasts , indicating a good response . 
You will follow up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] on Friday to discuss the next steps in your treatment . 
Your creatinine was increasing ( number that shows kidney function ) , which we think is likely due to acute interstitial nephritis ( allergic reaction in your kidneys likely from medications ) . 
You should follow up with urology clinic and renal clinic about this and the blood in your urine you had a couple of weeks ago . 
You should also follow up in neurology clinic so they can check on the numbness in your left hand . 
Your sutures can be taken out in one week ( around [ * * 9 - 7 * * ] ) , this can be done at clinic . 
Transferred to CCU with hypoxic distress in context of AF with RVR , developed PNA and transferred to MICU with stabilized AF .

CXR [ * * 2 1 5 9 - 4 - 2 2 * * ] IMPRESSIONS : FINDINGS : Comparison is made to prior study from [ * * 2 1 5 9 - 4 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Study is markedly limited due to patient positioning and the severe scoliosis . 
Allowing for this , however , there appears to be opacities within both lower lobes which are worrisome for consolidation or pneumonia . 
The consolidations on the right side are much more apparent than on the study from yesterday . 
Aspiration cannot be excluded . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 5 9 - 4 - 2 7 * * ] FINDINGS : As compared to the previous radiograph , the volume of the right hemithorax has decreased . 
As a consequence , there is increased crowding of the right perihilar vessels . 
However , there is no clear evidence of pneumonia ( the film strongly resembles the examination performed on [ * * 2 1 5 9 - 4 - 2 4 * * ] , 8 : 0 3 a . m . ) .

Presence of a minimal right - sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded . 
Minimally increased diameters of the pulmonary vessels in the right upper lobe could indicate mild overhydration . 
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette . 
Unchanged aspect of the left lung . 
Patient was admitted to the cardiology service and dofetilide was initiated given atrial fibrillation . 
On HD # 1 patient develope hypoxic respiratory distress reguiring transfer to the CCU where he was treated for community acquired pneumonia with Vancomycin , Cefepime , and Doxycycline given concern for QT prolongatoin . 
During his stay in the CCU he was intermittently in atrial fibrillation with RVR and would intermittently develop respiratory distress reguiring BiPap . 
Patient was eventually transferred to the MICU for more intensive management of his pulmonary issues . 
There the patient completed his course of antibiotics and was diuresed . 
Slowly the patients breathing improved and on [ * * 5 - 4 * * ] was transfered to the general medical floor . 
Hypoxic Respiratory Distress : On presentation to the hospital patient was at baseline pulmonary status . 
Initial CXR with question of RLL opacity . 
On HD # 1 patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure which [ * * Hospital 7 0 6 5 5 * * ] transfer to the CCU and broad spectrum antibiotics to treat RLL pneumonia visualized on CXR . 
Further patient became febrile prior to transfer . 
Initially patient was thought to have RLL infiltrate c / w pneumonia and high fever . 
Patient was treated for probable RLL pneumonia with Vancomycin , Cefepime , and Doxycycline completing an 8 day course . 
On transfer to the MICU the patient appeared to have superimposed pulmonary edema from volume resuscitation as evidenced by LOS fluid balance , interval weight , and clinical exam . 
MICU attempted low dose lasix overnight [ * * 4 - 2 7 * * ] for diuresis and monitored respiratory status , with 7 0 0 cc out and no worsening in creatinine . 
Non - contrast CT showed moderate right sided pleural effusion . 
Based upon patient ' s respiratory distress , he underwent a 1 . 5 L thoracentesis on [ * * 4 - 2 9 * * ] with interval improvement in respiratory status . 
Patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomy and severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes of fluid . 
A Urine legionella was negative . 
Blood cultures negative ( finalized ) . 
Sputum cultures contaminated . 
Pleural fluid appeared transudative and cultures NGTD . 
The patient was maintained on nebulizers as needed . 
The patient underwent aggressive diuresis with IV lasix and was negative approximately 6 liters for his MICU stay ( though even from admission weight ) . 
The patient initially required BiPap around the clock . 
He was weaned to a shovel mask and eventually to a nasal cannula with diuresis . 
He continued on BiPap at night with his home settings . 
Based upon radiographic images , there was concern that patient may be aspirating . 
He was evaluated by speech and swallow who cleared the patient for solids and thin liquids ; pills whole with puree . 
After diuresis patient continued to improve , no longer needing BiPAP during the day . 
Patient was transferred to the general medical floor where diuresis was continued . 
The patient was maintained on nasal cannula 1 - 2 L for a week , and finally weaned down to RA , satting mid 9 0 s on discharge . 
The patient was discharged on Lasix and Aldactone . 
Atrial fibrillation : On admission to the hospital patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation . 
With therapeutic INRs for the past two months . 
Decision was made to start dofetilide . 
Patient initially converted to sinus rhythm prior to transfer to CCU . 
During CCU stay patient was paroxysmally in atrial fibrillation which was intermittently controlled with diltiazem . 
The patient was continued on dofetilide per EP recommendations , and daily EKGs were initially obtained to monitor for QT prolongation . 
The patient ' s diltiazem was up - titrated as tolerated . 
At the time of leaving the MICU , he was on Diltiazem Extended Release 2 4 0 mg PO BID . 
He was in sinus rhythm . 
On the floor , the patient was intermittently in afib . 
He was started on Metoprolol 2 5 mg PO BID for better heart rate control . 
He was intermittently in afib and junction rhythm ( rate 6 0 s - 8 0 s ) . 
Dofetilide was discontinued on [ * * 5 - 1 4 * * ] .

Although he feels reletively well in atrial flutter he has noticed a decrease in exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath . 
He used to be able to walk one mile but in the last 2 months his exercise tolerance has decreased to unable to climb 1 flight of stairs . 
He also experiences lightheadedess when bending over when he is in atrial flutter . 
Since the patient was becoming more sympomatic he was scheduled to undergo elective ablation . 
During the procedure , initial BP was 1 6 8 / 1 0 9 ( baseline ) . 
He got etomidate and succ for intubation , followed by fentanyl and midazolam . 
The procedure went well and his atrial flutter converted to NSR . 
Immediately after conversion , patient became hypotensive to 7 0 / 5 0 . 
Stat echo showed mildly depressed EF without signs of tamponade . 
He was started on phenylephrine briefly which was quickly weaned prior to arrival in CCU .

She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT , which responded to 5 0 mg of Lidocaine IV . 
She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress . 
ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection . 
Of note , she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 5 0 0 s in the ED with an AG of 2 0 , that came down to 1 6 . 
On immediate LHC , a 1 0 0 % occlusion of her OM 1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS , resulting in TIMI 2 flow . 
Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 6 0 % stenosis at most . 
On transfer to the CCU , she was intubated , sedated , being on IV Levophed at 2 0 / hr , Dobutamine at 2 0 0 / hr and Dopamine at 3 0 0 / hr . 
Her CO was recorded as 6 . 0 , her CI 3 . 5 with an initial SVR of 1 0 1 2 . 
Her Temp . 
She spiked a temperature up to 1 0 1 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 4 0 K . 
Vasopressin was added IV , which provided further support of her MAP . 
Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 1 8 - 2 4 and a urine output between 3 0 and 1 0 0 cc / hr . 
When her CI dropped to 1 . 9 around 9 . 3 0 pm with an increased SVR of 1 5 5 0 , the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated , which was then brought down to 1 6 / hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin . 
The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI .

I ( Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] was the attending of record only from [ * * 1 2 - 1 * * ] through [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 1 2 - 3 * * ] . 
Sepsis : felt to be due to toxic shock associated with tampon use . 
Cervical cx . 
Pt . 
She improved hemodynamically and abx were tapered to clindamycin po and she was transferred to the medical [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] , at which time wbc again rose with eosinophilia , this was changed to cefalexin for one day . 
As WBC continued to rise , all abx were stopped . 
At this time a morbilliform drug erruption was noted truncally , and eosinophilia persisted . 
These began to resolve by d / c with discontinuation of all abx . 
At time of d / c , pt . 
Her ICU course was complicated by mild acute renal failure that improved with fluids , as well as mild pulmonary edema , attributed to massive IV fluid resuscutation on presentation , which resolved over time with auto diuresis . 
Medications on Admission : Tums only . 
Discharge Medications : Benadryl prn for itching . 
Discharge Instructions : No new medications were prescribed . 
You can resume TUMS as you were prior to coming to the hospital , and you can use over the counter benadryl for itching as needed , as we discussed . 
She reports 1 month of increasing fatigue , weakness , and occasional falls ( knee buckling ) . 
Occasional cough with brown sputum and chronic loose stools , but no fevers , chills , sweats , dyspnea , nausea , vomiting , black or bloody stools . 
Regarding her complaints , she reports that her BP medications have been adjusted , but this has not helped . 
She has also experienced intermittent L - sided sharp chest pains that worsen with arm movement , and was prescribed nitroglycerin that she ended up taking daily instead of on a PRN basis . 
In the ED , initial vs were : T 9 7 . 4 P 6 9 BP 6 4 / 5 3 R 1 4 9 7 % O 2 sat on RA . 
Per report , she was mentating appropriately . 
A triple lumen femoral CVC was placed . 
She was bolused 5 0 0 cc , given Vancomycin and Zosyn , and started on Levophed at 0 . 0 6 . 
CXR was unremarkable . 
CT C / A / P were obtained and prelim only significant for a right adenexal cyst ( present since [ * * Month ( only ) 4 0 4 * * ] ) . 
On the floor , the patient was appropriate and comfortable . 
She was placed on a Nicom . 
CI and SVI improved with leg raise so Pt was given 2 5 0 cc , then on repeat given additional 2 5 0 cc . 
Levophed was weaned off . 
Widowed , lives at home with sister , who is primary caregiver . 
Hypotension is likely secondary to a too aggressive antihypertensive regimen , current medication misuse , or possibly over - diuresis at HD ( with need for reassessment of dry weight ) . 
Supporting a possible over beta - blockade is a HR that has consistently remained in the 6 0 s despite BPs in the 6 0 s . 
Additionally she was started on nitroglycerin and had been taking it daily rather than on a PRN basis . 
She is responsible for her medications , yet unable to correctly remember dosing regimen . 
Other etiologies to consider given the chronicity include endocrine causes such untreated hypothyroidism ( pill bottle not in bag ) or adrenal insufficiency . 
Received a total of 1 . 5 L of volume resuscitation . 
Levophed weaned off . 
Outpt Nephrologist reports dry weight as 7 4 kg . 
She was started initially on road spectrum antibiotics which were quickly discontinued when all cultures were negative . 
TSH , free T 4 , and AM Cortisol obtained and pt restarted home levothyroxine dose for significant hypothyroidism . 
CT abd / pelvis was unremarkable except for stable adnexal cyst . 
Blood pressures remained stable while patient was off her anti - hypertensives . 
After chart review she had been started on these during an admission for chest pain at which time a cath revealed clean coronary arteries . 
Therefore it is felt she does not need these medications and they were stopped . 
She will continue on simvastatin for her cholesterol management and ASA to reduce her risk of stroke . 
She will follow up with her PCP or in [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) 1 9 4 4 * * ] clinic for a BP check off of her medications and will have VNA checking her BPs at home as well . 
Her PCP can titrate medications as necessary . 
Supporting this is a Hct above baseline likely reflecting hemoconcentration . 
Pt is on advair without documented hx of COPD . 
CXR not reflective of this and bicarb not chronically elevated . 
No evidence of peaked T waves on EKG . 
She was given insulin , kayexelate overnight and repeated insulin per renal recs prior to dialysis this AM . 
K was noted to be wnl on follow up AM labs . 
Also may have a nutritional component as well . 
Prolonged PTT likely [ * * 2 - 1 6 * * ] heparin received at HD . 
No evidence to support bleeding . 
PTT resolved off heparin . 
Platelets were stable and did not require transfusion . 
BL Hct around 3 1 . 
On EPO as outpt . 
Hct was trended and stable ; pt did not require transfusion of blood components during her ICU stay . 
EKG consistent with prior . 
Trop at 0 . 0 5 , likely [ * * 2 - 1 6 * * ] demand in setting of CKI . 
CK and CKMB added on and non - concerning for ACS . 
Pt asymptomatic . 
She was continued on asa 8 1 mg , simvastatin 2 0 mg . 
BBlocker and ACEi held for observation of hemodynamic stability given admission complaint . 
Levothyroxine was not in her pill bag , in discussion with her pharmacy this prescription had not been filled in many months . 
Pt was started on Levothyroxine 1 8 8 mcg daily , will need repeat TFT ' s in [ * * 4 - 2 0 * * ] weeks . 
Arranged for her pills to be delivered in a bubble pack to help with med compliance in the future . 
No SI / HI .

He developed a large cellulitis / furunculosis per the patient which he lanced and subsequently it healed on its own . 
He was initially taking percocet for the pain but given that it was not working , he was started on methadone that seems to improve his pain control . 
He was also drinking vodka over the last 3 days to help with the pain . 
He went to see his PCP Dr [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 1 0 3 7 8 * * ] who decided to sent a Lumbar MRI .

SPARSE GROWTH . 
SPARSE GROWTH . 
There has been no significant change since the prior study . 
There is destruction of the L 4 / 5 disc as well as the inferior endplate of L 4 and the superior endplate of L 5 . 
There is diffuse enhancement of the vertebral bodies of L 4 and L 5 as well as diffuse enhancement of the surrounding paraspinal soft tissues extending into the psoas muscles bilaterally . 
There is also extension of soft tissue enhancement into the epidural space at the L 4 / 5 level . 
This is causing moderate compression of the thecal sac . 
These findings are consistent with discitis , osteomyelitis , with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon , the latter causing moderate thecal sac compression . 
No discrete fluid collections identifying an abscess cavity are seen . 
The involved vertebrae and disc are T 2 hyperintense , consistent with inflammatory edema . 
The conus medullaris normally ends at the level of L 1 and no signal abnormalities of the visualized spinal cord are seen . 
IMPRESSION : No significant change since [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 8 - 6 * * ] , with L 4 and L 5 with osteomyelitis and discitis , with paraspinal and epidural phlegmon , the latter causing moderate compression of the thecal sac . 
Above findings were discussed with directly with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 0 3 5 1 * * ] , the requesting physician , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) * * ] an emergent neurosurgical consult was recommended and obtained . 
TTE ( [ * * 8 - 8 * * ] ) : IMPRESSION : Normal study . 
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified . 
TEE ( [ * * 8 - 1 9 * * ] ) : IMPRESSION : No valvular pathology or abscess identified . 
Chest X - ray : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality . 
Questionable nodular opacity at left lung apex , finding that could indicate a superimposition of vascular and osseous structures , although dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended for further assessment . 
A focal orchitis is felt to be less likely given the lack of vascular flow . 
Brief Hospital Course : 5 0 y / o M with h / o IV drug abuse , cirrhosis , ETOH , hep C , and DM who presents with L 4 / L 5 osteomyelitis . 
S / p CT - guided bx of L 4 / L 5 disc on [ * * 8 - 1 1 * * ] - Yeast grown from disc cx found to be [ * * Female First Name ( un ) * * ] albicans . 
Complicated by thrombocytopenia , ARF , and hypotension . 
L 4 - L 5 osteomyelitis w / phlegmonous extension : An initial evaluation by neurosurgery was performed . 
However , neurosurgery did not feel that the pt was a candidate for surgery . 
A medical approach was taken with various antibiotics over the course of the [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] hospital stay . 
An initial blood cx at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] grew [ * * 2 - 9 * * ] coag - neg staph . 
No further blood or urine cultures were positive . 
So it was thought to be a contaminant although this could not be ruled out . 
For this reason , the pt was stared on Vancomycin which was discontinued later during the hospital course b / o suspected bone marrow suppression thought to cause significant thrombocytopenia , leukopenia and anemia . 
A disc cx from [ * * 8 - 1 1 * * ] grew sparse [ * * Female First Name ( un ) * * ] albicans and beta - glucan lab test was positive making [ * * Female First Name ( un ) * * ] albicans osteomyelitis most likely despite a bone cx from [ * * 8 - 1 2 * * ] showing no growth . 
The pt was started on Amphotericin after the positive cx results . 
At that time he was still treated with both Vancomycin and Amphotericin . 
However , the pt developed ATN which was attributed to Amphotericin . 
So both Vancomycin and Amphotericin have been D / C ' d over the course of his stay b / o ATN and thrombocytopenia / leukopenia , and treatment with Caspofungin has been started on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] ( initially with 3 5 mg IV q 2 4 h , later increased to 5 0 mg IV q 2 4 h ) and continued throughout the remainder of his stay . 
The patient was moved to the ICU when developing recurrent hypotension and worsening renal failure , but recovered soon thereafter . 
The patient improved significantly towards the end of his hospital stay and his symptoms were well controlled at discharge . 
He was afebrile and able to ambulate . 
A lumbar brace has been placed . 
CRP was trending down from 5 8 . 6 [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 8 - 7 * * ] to 1 1 . 8 [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 9 - 1 3 * * ] . 
Further recovery is expected at an extended care facility . 
Followup appointments have been scheduled with ID and neurosurgery . 
An outpatient MRI of the L - spine has been scheduled as well . 
The patient should also get weekly CBC , LFTs and BUN / Crea while on Caspofungin . 
Results should be faxed to Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 9 4 0 4 * * ] at [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 1 4 1 9 * * ] . 
Acute Renal Failure . 
Baseline creatinine was 0 . 7 - 0 . 9 ( 0 . 9 on [ * * 8 - 1 5 * * ] ) . 
Crea was 2 . 4 on [ * * 8 - 1 6 * * ] . 8 on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] . 0 on [ * * 8 - 1 9 * * ] . 
He was anuric from [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 6 7 4 0 4 * * ] with uremic symptoms ( nausea / vomiting ) . 
His Crea was 5 . 7 on [ * * 8 - 2 2 * * ] after starting CVV hemodialysis on [ * * 8 - 2 0 * * ] . 
After having been in the ICU b / o ARF and recurrent hypotension , the patient recovered quickly on the floor and his kidneys proceded to the polyuric phase . 
Crea 1 . 6 on [ * * 8 - 2 8 * * ] . 
Crea came down to 1 . 3 towards the end of his stay . 
After the polyuric phase , the kidney function returned to [ * * Location 2 1 3 * * ] output . 
The patient was asymptomatic at discharge . 
Thrombocytopenia . 
Plts 1 5 2 on admission , Plts 6 9 on [ * * 8 - 1 3 * * ] on [ * * 8 - 2 0 * * ] . 
Anti - platelet 4 ( HIT ) antibody was positive and the patient was initially thought to have HIT . 
All heparin products were D / C ' ed . 
However , on [ * * 8 - 2 6 * * ] Serotonin Release Ab came back negative . 
Since HIT Ab not very specific and SRA test negative , the diagnosis of HIT was questioned at this point . 
Treatment with Vancomycin correlated with the worsening thrombocytopenia and was thought to be a likely cause . 
After having D / C ' ed Vancomycin , the CBC improved consistently . 
The pt did not bleed significantly except for mild R conjunctival bleeding observed [ * * 8 - 2 2 * * ] . 
Platelet transfusions were given on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] in order to raise plts temporarily for line removals . 
Platelets came up from 2 0 to 3 1 o / n . 
Platelets came up considerably towards the end of his stay ( Platelets 7 7 on [ * * 8 - 3 1 * * ] ) . 
The patient was discharged without any signs of active bleeding and hemodynamically stable . 
Anemia : Hct 3 5 . 9 on [ * * 8 - 7 * * ] . 5 on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] , Pt received 2 U PRBC on [ * * 8 - 2 5 * * ] raising Hct up to 2 6 . 3 and stable thereafter . 
Following course of renal dysfunction , perhaps due to low erythropoeitin levels . 
Iron studies consistent w / ACD . 
Also occult bleeding was considered since pt was also thrombocytopenic , cirrhotic , and uremic . 
Stools were guaiaced . 
Improvement was noted when Vancomycin was D / C ' ed . 
Vancomycin was likely cause of suppression of all three lines in the bone marrow although multiple factors were certainly involved . 
Patient ' s Hct came up again towards the end of his stay . 
Hct was 2 9 . 6 [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 9 - 1 3 * * ] . 
Pt was asymptomatic at discharge . 
Leukopenia : WBC dropped down to 2 . 9 on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] , but after that continuously rising . 
WBC 4 . 0 on [ * * 8 - 2 8 * * ] and stable thereafter ( previous baseline [ * * 6 - 1 3 * * ] ) . 
Possible causes were immunosuppression b / o fungal osteo or medications , especially Vancomycin which causes bone marrow suppression . 
Vanco had been D / C ' ed . 
WBC stable . 
Patient did not develop any opportunistic infections and his osteomyelitis stayed stable despite the transient leukopenia . 
Pt was asymptomatic at discharge . 
Pain : Low back pain with radiation to both legs ( R > L ) was managed throughout the [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] hospital stay with a variety of pain medications including a Fentanyl patch , Methadone at increasing doses , Morphine , Dilaudid IV and PO , Oxycontin and Oxycodone . 
The patient became hypotensive on some of these medications . 
The fentanyl patch was D / C ' ed b / o that although multiple factors were likely responsible for his hypotensive episodes . 
Methadone was tapered during his hospitalization by 2 0 mg / day with MSContin increased by 3 0 mg / day throughout the taper . 
His pain regimen on discharge is as follows : MSContin 4 3 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] , Neurontin 9 0 0 mg tid , Tylenol 5 0 0 mg qid , Dilaudid 3 0 mg q 4 - 6 h prn , Tramadol 5 0 mg q 4 - 6 h prn . 
Thigh pain : New left lateral thigh pain on [ * * 8 - 2 5 * * ] and right lateral thigh pain on [ * * 8 - 2 8 * * ] . 
No bruise or bulge at either thigh . 
DVT on L leg ruled out with LENIS . 
Pain seems to be muscular and most likely due to recent use of LE muscles after extended periods of immobility . 
The pain was managed with the same medications as stated above . 
The new quality of pain subsided soon after having been mobile for longer periods and was thought to be different from his radiating back pain [ * * 3 - 1 0 * * ] osteomyelitis . 
Acute scrotal pain : Pt developed acute left scrotal pain radiating up his groin and flank on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] . 
Pt received 5 0 0 cc IV NS bolus , 4 mg Dilaudid , scrotal and renal u / s were unremarkable except for an incidentally found R testicular lesion . 
Urology was consulted . 
DD included testicular torsion , orchitis , acute kidney stone , inguinal hernia . 
Doppler U / S of kidneys negative for [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 5 7 0 3 * * ] thrombosis on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] .

Pt was started on metformin 5 0 0 mg qam one week prior to discharge . 
Pt was asymptomatic throughout his stay . 
Cirrhosis / Hep C : no history of GI bleeding , encephalopathy or any other complications in the past . 
Pt developed transiently cholestatic labs during stay , likely due to infectious process and mulitple medications . 
Pt was briefly icteric , but returned quickly to normal state . 
Labs remained at baseline elevation for the remainder of his stay . 
Pt received Hepatitis A vaccination . 
The outpatient medication Spironolactone has been discontinued during the hospital stay because the patient developed acute renal failure . 
It was not restarted upon discharge . 
It is recommended to discuss the restarting of spironolactone with his liver team during follow up as an outpatient . 
Hyponatremia : Initially progressed to sodium of 1 2 4 , but later wnl . 
Pt was euvolemic throughout his hospital stay . 
No rx was necessary and sodium was stable at discharge .

Initial work - up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium were unrevealing . 
Urine analysis was unremarkable , chest xray showed no infiltrate , blood cultures showed no growth . 
A head CT was negative for an acute intracranial process . 
A head MRI was also obtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes , and showed only chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia . 
An EEG was obtained and was negative for epileptiform activity . 
She began to answer fewer questions , and began to appear somewhat paranoid . 
Psychiatry saw pt and recommended increasing antipsychotic dosage from short acting seroquel 2 5 0 mg po qhs , to long - acting seroquel 3 0 0 mg po qHS and adding on haldol 1 mg po BID . 
This was done , and the next morning ( [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 8 - 1 6 * * ] ) the patient seemed withdrawn and stuporous . 
She was awake but not responsive to questions verbally , answering only with mild head nodding . 
At this time , she was found to have a urinary tract infection ( see below ) , seroquel and haldol were discontinued and the urinary tract infection was treated and her mental status improved the following day , returning to a level similar to at the time of admission . 
On [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 8 - 2 0 * * ] , she appeared ill and was again withdrawn . 
She was febrile and diaphoretic . 
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vanc / cefepime / flagyl . 
Pt then developed recurrent SVT to the 2 2 0 s , relieved with carotid massage . 
She appeared rigid and diaphoretic . 
She was transferred to the ICU for further management . 
In the unit psychiatry was consulted and atypical presentation for neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered . 
She was treated with 2 mg cogentin and ativan with mild improvement in her mental status . 
She was transferred back to the general medicine floor , where her mental status continued to wax and wane but never returned to her initial level of interactiveness on admission . 
She was responsive to some questions , but refusing to answer others . 
She did not participate in physical exam commands . 
She remained stable at this point for several days . 
Given the extensive negative work up for delirium , this was considered to be her new baseline and placement was found for skilled nursing facility for discharge with permission from her health care proxy . 
At time of discharge , the patient remains AAO x 2 ( unchanged from before ) ; she is alert and talkative ; still having delusions that her family is outside waiting for her ; gets agitated about wanting to leave hospital and often refuses to sit or stay in bed . 
Throughout hospitalization the patient was convinced that her hallucinations and delusions were real . 
She was treated with ceftriaxone . 
Urine culture revealed grew out presumptive Strep Bovis and E . coli grow out in her urine . 
On [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 8 - 1 9 * * ] she developed SVT to the 2 2 0 s , which resolved spontaneously . 
Over the course of the following day , she had 4 more episodes of SVT which responded to carotid massage , she was never hypotensive . 
SHe was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring . 
Cardiology was consulted who identified the rhythm as atrial tachycardia vs . AVNRT . 
The patient has been stable on Metoprolol 2 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
There was no evidence of pulmomary edema or consolidation . 
She was quickly weaned to room air . 
As part of a work up , an ABG was performed which showed pO 2 of 5 8 , this corrected to 9 2 with 2 LNC . 
Patient was maintained on supplemental oxygen without improvement in mental status . 
Given significant a - A gradient , and persistent tachycardia , CTA was performed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism . 
Patient has a 2 0 pack year history and likely has baseline hypoxia with sufficient compensation to maintain peripheral O 2 saturation > 9 2 % . 
At time of discharge , the patient no longer has an oxygen requirement , and is satting mid to high 9 0 s on RA . 
Given her complaints of left leg and ankle pain , orthopedic and rheumatologic causes were considered , as well as PE . 
Plain films of the left ankle and hip were negative for fracture , but did show an area of possible bone infarct in the distal tibia of unclear significance . 
Rheumatology was consulted who did not believe the presentation was consistent with SLE , or gout . 
Amyloidosis was also considered however SPEP and UPEP , total protein and globulin levels were unremarkable . 
Statin - induced myopathy was considered , and statin was held however CK had already begun to trend down when the statin was stopped , making statin induced myopathy unlikely . 
A LE doppler was negative for DVT . 
MRI of the leg MRI was done to evaluate for myositis , skeletal vasculitis or other inflammatory myopathy , and diabetic myonecrosis . 
It was negative for any muscle inflammation or necrosis , and showed only edema in the subcutaneous tissues , which had been noted on physical exam . 
Within the first few days of her admission , ankle pain and erythemia resolved , etiology remains unclear . 
Patient had received PRN doses of haldol , home seroquel 2 5 0 mg . 
However , all antipsychotics had been D / C ' d 2 days prior to symptom onset . 
Antipsychotics were held . 
The patient was given 1 mg cogentin x 2 . 
Psych was consulted , who felt that her symptoms were consistent with EPS . 
The patient was started on Ativan 1 mg q 6 hrs PRN agitation . 
Upon transfer back to the general medicine floor , her rigidity had improved and she continued to be treated with prn ativan for agitation , though this made pt quite somnolent . 
On [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 8 - 2 5 * * ] she was restarted on seroquel 5 0 mg po BID prn agitation in an effort to avoid sedation associated with benzos . 
Then as per Psych recommendation , the patient was restarted on low dose , 2 5 mg , seroquel [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
All other PRN doses of seroquel and Ativan were held . 
The patient seems to be responding well to this regimen . 
She was still measuring in SBP 1 7 0 s on several occasions despite being on max dose of numerous BP meds , including metoprolol , losartan , furosemide , and clonidine patch . 
While in house , hydralazine 1 0 mg po TID was added to pt ' s regimen , and metoprolol was further increased to 2 0 0 mg po BID for management of SVT . 
On this regimen , her pressures ranged from SBP 1 4 0 s - 1 5 0 s , occassionally in the 1 7 0 s . 
CK normalized to 9 2 by time of discharge . 
She should have her CK rechecked as outpatient and consider restarting simvastatin as outpatient . 
Clopidogrel was continued on admission but simvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondary to elevated CK levels . 
Patient was continued on albuterol , ipratropium , tiotropium . 
Symbicort was replaced with advair during admission due to formulary . 
Pt is likely compensated at a lower pO 2 secondary to her lung disease . 
She was repeatedly hypoxic during admission without complaints of shortness of breath . 
Her lorazepam was held throughout hospital admission .

You had a full workup of your heart which was negative for any problems with your heart as the reason for your symptoms . 
This was including a stress test that was negative for any significant cardiac abnormalities . 
While you were here , your coumadin level ( INR ) was found to be low . 
We have started you on a medication , Lovenox , to be injected twice daily . 
This should be continued until your INR becomes therapeutic at a level of [ * * 3 - 1 4 * * ] . 
You should follow up with your primary care doctor this week for regular checks of your INR to determine when you can stop this medication . 
Your first lab check for this will be in 2 days from discharge on [ * * 2 1 5 1 - 1 - 2 9 * * ] where you should get your INR checked before your annual physical exam with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 2 7 5 4 2 * * ] . 
Please take all your medications as prescribed and keep all follow up appointments .

Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with mild vascular congestion suggested . 
EKG : NSR at 9 4 , NANI , low limb lead voltage , poor RWP ( old ) ; no significant change from prior . 
TTE [ * * 2 1 0 7 - 1 1 - 1 4 * * ] : The left atrium is moderately dilated . 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 1 8 mmHg ) .

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is a very small circumferenital pericardial effusion . 
Cardiomegaly , mild axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . 
Bilateral pleural effusions with areas of subsequent atelectasis , patchy lower lobe predominant parenchymal opacity is potentially suggestive of a combination of pneumonia and atelectasis . 
No pathologic air collection in the mediastinum and the lung interstitium . 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute vascular territorial infarction . 
There is no hydrocephalus . 
Opacification of sphenoid sinus , maxillary , ethmoid air cells and nasopharynx , most likely related to recent intubation . 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or obvious major territorial acute infarct , mass effect , or hydrocephalus . 
If there is continued concern , MR of the head with diffusion - weighted imaging sequence is more sensitive in the detection of acute stroke . 
Diffuse opacification of the sphenoid sinus , nasopharynx , the maxillary and the ethmoid air cells partly related to mucosal thickening , secretions from intubation . 
However , patient also had a left antrochoanal polyp in the past , which is incompletely assessed on the present study . 
Discontinuous foci in the left parietal bone may relate to thinning of the bone , from arachnoid granulations or other etiology , to correlate with any history of surgery . 
However , this appearance is unchanged compared to the prior CT sinus study done on [ * * 2 1 0 2 - 1 0 - 1 9 * * ] .

No change in small 1 . 5 cm thrombus within the infrarenal IVC . 
Second separate smaller thrombus in the right common iliac vein near the transplant renal vein anastomosis on the prior study not definitely visualized and may have cleared with anticoagulation . 
Atelectasis of both dependent lower lobes . 
More confluent consolidative opacity of the superior right lower lobe could be explained with atelectasis but is concerning for possible area of aspiration or pneumonia . 
Evaluation after diuresis is recommended to exclude the possibility of underlying infectious process . 
Brief Hospital Course : 6 1 M with ESRD s / p CRT , HTN , DM , admitted with dyspnea and ARF . 
During IR placement of an HD catheter he suffered a PEA arrest x 2 . 
He was cooled using artic sun protocol . 
He slowly recovered , but his hospitalization was complicated by prolonged intubation leading to tacheostomy placement , Psuedomonas UTI , HAP , Stenotrophomonas PNA , aspiration PNA , acute on chronic kidney injury leading to loss of fuction of his transplanted kidney , IVC thombosis , spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrage during heparinization for his thrombus , gout flair , and altered mental status which has slowly improved . 
After more than a month in the hospital he has stabilized , is ambulating with assistance , speaking through a Passe Muir valve , and tolerating tube feeds . 
Developed aspiration pneumonitis vs . aspiration PNA . 
CXR showed no clear evidence of PNA but CT showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL . 
Pt was febrile following aspiration event and ended up re - intubated . 
Now s / p 7 - day course of vanc / zosyn for aspiration that ended on [ * * 2 1 0 7 - 1 2 - 1 8 * * ] . 
Respiratory status has dramatically improved and he is now on trach mask only . 
He had a video swallow evaluation on [ * * 2 1 0 7 - 1 2 - 2 0 * * ] which showed silent aspiration . 
It was suggested that he have a diet of nectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids . 
He should have follow up with speech therapy at rehab with repeat video swallow if diet is to be advanced . 
On Bactrim x 1 4 day course , day 1 = [ * * 1 2 - 1 6 * * ] to d / c [ * * 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] . 
Note that Bactrim must be give FOLLOWING HD as it is dialyzed off . 
Intially diagnosed [ * * 1 2 - 2 * * ] , but was inadquately treated as Bactrim was given prior to HD rather than after . 
Then Linezolid was added for purulent appearing CVL . 
His lines were exchanged and complicated by PEA arrest during procedure . 
His CVL grew out Micrococcus . 
According to ID , the Cefepime should have covered it . 
He received a 1 4 d course of Cefepime and 9 d course of Linezolid . 
A PICC line and new HD line were placed and have had no further complications . 
His infections were treated . 
He was given stress dose steroids . 
He was on pressors for hypotension . 
Ultimately this resolved and he became persistently hypertensive to the 1 9 0 s to 2 2 0 s . 
He was started on a labetalol drip as well as PRN hydralazine . 
He has been transitioned from Labetalol drip to PO Labetalol on [ * * 1 2 - 9 * * ] , then switched to Labetalol PRN . 
On [ * * 1 2 - 1 4 * * ] , Labetalol was d / c ? ? ? ? ? ? ed . 
Continue atenolol at 5 0 mg daily . 
Continue lisinopril 1 0 mg daily . 
Receiveing pulse steroids with Prednisone 4 0 mg daily x 5 days starting on [ * * 2 1 0 7 - 1 2 - 2 0 * * ] . 
Will resume chronic Prednisone 5 mg PO daily for maintenance of transplanted kidney thereafter . 
He was on a heparin drip , being bridged with coumadin . 
However , all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma developed ( see helow ) . 
Hematology was consulted regarding whether it is appropriate to resume anticoagulation given the risk of bleed , and recommended SC Heparin tid until he follows up with Hematology and possibly vascular surgery regarding possible benefits vs . risks of an IVC filter placement . 
The patient should not be anti - coagulated with agents other than SC Heparin given his high risk of bleed . 
CT abdomen [ * * 1 2 - 1 1 * * ] showed large liver hematoma with scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation . 
Currently improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension . 
Abd is much less tense than prior . 
Continue Reglan 2 . 5 mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic gastroparesis . 
Advancing diet as tolerated with tube feeds . 
IR consulted re : possible embolization , did not feel the bleed was acute ( felt > 4 8 hours old ) and wished to preserve hepatic artery and liver function if possible , so recommended monitoring Hct . 
General surgery consulted re : possible relation to PEG placement , but did not believe this was [ * * 2 - 7 * * ] procedure based on the location of the hematoma . 
Recommended montoring q 6 h Hct and coags , transfusing as needed and keeping Hct > 2 0 . 
Received total of 3 unit pRBC after reversal of PTT with FFP . 
Awaiting hematology recommendation for long term anticoagulation given presence of IVC thombus but complication of hemorrhage . 
Originally intubated in setting of arrest with hypoxia beforehand . 
Was very difficult to wean from vent due to persistent hypoxia , recurrent PNA , and altered mental status . 
Trach and PEG placed on [ * * 1 2 - 2 * * ] . 
Now stable on trach . 
Had aspiration even as above leading to short tern re - intubation . 
Now tolerating trach mask . 
Speaking with Passe Muir valve . 
Underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol . 
Suring weaning of sedation was severely agitated . 
Ultimately was transitioned from fentanyl to methadone and then weaned on seroquel . 
He had a significant set back from his liver hematoma and aspiration PNA . 
Neuro was consulted and noted a staring spell that was concerning for seizures . 
He was monitored with continuous EEG , which showed epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity . 
Neuro recommended startingKeppra , with Keppra 5 0 0 mg qday and an extra 2 5 0 mg after HD . 
The patient has slowly improved and is not conversant , [ * * Location ( un ) 1 1 3 1 * * ] , walking with assistance , and no longer agitated . 
He is alert and oriented . 
He is s / p CRT in [ * * 2 1 0 1 * * ] . 
Etiology of ARF likely multifactorial due to hypotension from PEA , sepsis , contrast loads , and nephrotoxic drugs . 
Her the Renal Service , he will not recover renal function of his kidney . 
He will require HD henceforth .

She was given IVF on transport and in the ED at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] . 
She was afebrile , and her blood pressure responded to fluid resuscitation to 9 0 s / 4 0 s on transfer . 
She has been mentating the entire time . 
At the OSH a chest X - Ray and Head CT were done . 
Both of which were negative for any acute process . 
She was given a dose of vancomycin and cefepime at the outside hospital out of concern for infection given her neutropenia ( WBC 0 . 2 at the OSH ) and hypotension .

Past Medical History : Interval History : Burkitt ' s Lymphoma : She was admitted [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 9 - 2 0 * * ] with 6 weeks of persistent , progressive shoulder pain . 
A CT scan showed a large axillary mass that was cocerning for recurrence of disease . 
She had an IR guided biopsy [ * * 9 - 2 2 * * ] which was inconclusive , and was then taken to the OR for surgical excisional biopsy [ * * 9 - 2 3 * * ] that showed recurrence of disease . 
On [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 9 - 2 5 * * ] she had an echocardiogram and began treatment with [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] .

OF TWO COLONIAL MORPHOLOGIES . 
FINAL SENSITIVITIES . 
No infectious source identified in the chest , abdomen or pelvis . 
Interval decrease in size of confluent right axillary adenopathy compared to [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 9 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Single stable left paraaortic lymph node . 
Sigmoid diverticulosis , without diverticulitis . 
Distention of the stomach , without evidence for mechanical obstruction . 
Correlate clinically . 
No acute pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology . 
Similar appearance of 1 - cm ground - glass nodular opacity in the right upper lobe . 
Recommend continued followup . 
Sub - 4 mm pulmonary nodules , with questionable interval increase in size , could be re - evaluated when followup for the ground - glass opacity . 
Slightly interval decrease in size of the right axillary lymph node conglomerate . 
Mild mitral regurgitation . 
No evidence of endocarditis seen . 
If clinically suggested , the absence of a vegetation by 2 D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 1 0 - 2 9 * * ] , the findings are similar . 
Abnormal septal motion was seen on the prior study also . 
She was fluid resuscitated to SBP of 7 0 s by EMS and SBP of 9 0 ' s by OSH ED prior to transfer . 
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vanco and transferred to 7 [ * * Hospital Ward Name 1 8 2 6 * * ] . 
On arrival she was given 2 L of fluid , 1 unit of blood , and cefepime , vancomycin , and flagyl . 
Her pressures responded . 
OSH cultures came back as VRE 1 : 4 bottles , sensitive to ampicillin , daptomycin , levofloxacin , and linezolid . 
She was switched to ampicillin on [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] and her PICC was pulled . 
She was switched to daptomycin on Monday [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 1 0 - 1 8 * * ] because she had begun receiving hyper CVAD part B and amp interferes with clearance of methotrexate . 
She had a TTE and TEE which showed no vegetations . 
As she was being treated for the bacteremia , Ms . [ * * Known lastname 5 2 * * ] again became hypotensive and febrile , requiring transfer to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] where she required pressors . 
Blood cultures were sent and ultimately returned positive with pseudomonas , believed to be associated with her central line . 
Her line was pulled and her broad spectrum antibiotic coverage ( started given her sepsis in the setting of neutropenia ) was narrowed to cefepime , gentamicin , and linezolid . 
Gentamicin was d / c - ed a few days after transfer to the floor and linezolid was transitioned to ampicillin as the patient was believed to have leukosuppression secondary to the linezolid . 
She completed a 1 0 day course of antibiotics ( amp and cefepime ) from the time her ANC was greater than 1 0 0 0 per ID recommendations and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her hospital course . 
An LP with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [ * * 2 1 3 4 - 1 0 - 1 4 * * ] . 
A subclavian line was placed on [ * * 1 0 - 1 5 * * ] and treatment with hyper CVAD part B was started on [ * * 1 0 - 1 6 * * ] . 
She tolerated her chemotherapy well , complicated by mild mucositis and the bacteremia discussed above . 
She had one more round of intrathecal chemotherapy with cytarabine on [ * * 1 1 - 4 * * ] . 
LPs on [ * * 1 1 - 1 8 * * ] , and [ * * 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] were negative for malignant cells . 
Patient had significant right shoulder and arm pain as well as right hand weakness , believed secondary to brachial plexus involvement of her lymphoma . 
She underwent MRI of her R shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4 sessions of XRT as a palliative therapy . 
She had 4 LP ' s which were negative for malignant cells . 
Had IT cytarabine on [ * * 1 1 - 1 8 * * ] prior to discharge which she tolerated well . 
Pt had CT of torso to evaluate for progression of disease , read at the time of discharge was pending but will be followed up at follow - up appointment Monday following discharge when pt will return for chemotherapy gemcitabine and vinorelbine . 
Acyclovir and fluconazole were held given elevated LFTs , will trend LFTs as outpatient and do liver ultrasound if necessary . 
Pt was given pentamidine prior to discharge for PCP [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) 1 1 0 2 * * ] . 
This continued intermittently through her [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] stay and subsequently on the floor . 
Tachycardia was sinus in nature , up into the 1 4 0 s with movement , and was attributed to an underlying cardiomyopathy ( EF 4 5 - 5 0 % on echo , last on [ * * 1 0 - 2 9 * * ] ) . 
Cardiology was consulted for management and she was started on metoprolol 1 2 . 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] which she tolerated well . 
She was thrombocytopenic during her admission and her lovenox was held . 
An ultrasound of the arm was repeated and was negative for clot . 
Continued Levothyroxine 1 0 0 mcg PO daily . 
Was started on citalopram 1 0 mg daily .

[ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 3 1 7 7 * * ] . 
At least two ectobic sites , one in the atria causing the SVT and one causing the VT . 
Probable causes previous MI , hyper / hypotension , elytes . 
Pt denies any CP / SOB / orthopnea . 
TSH was normal at 1 . 8 . 
ECG from [ * * Hospital 1 3 4 * * ] showed NSVT negative in II , III , F , positive in 1 , L , transition at V 3 / V 4 in setting of SVT possible AT at 2 6 0 . 
ECG on arrival to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] in sinus showed RBBB , LAFB , left atrial abnormality Pt was started on procainamide gtt at 3 , VT initially reduced but then flared up and gtt was increased to 4 , and then DCd prior to ablation . 
Pt continued to have runs of VT and was taken for ablation . 
EP lab transseptal approach to ablate focus in LV , however found several other foci of VT as well as AT . 
Given multiple foci not all of which successfully ablated , decision to treat with antiarrythmics . 
Pt also had a competing atrial tachycardia . 
Given procainamide 9 5 0 mg IV bolus which converted to sinus ( although sinus rhythm difficult to tell from VT - mainly by rate - VT rate was 1 3 0 , sinus in 9 0 s ) and then transitioned to amiodarone with procainamide DCd . 
Pt was monitored but continued having occasional runs of VT , and plan was to place permanent pacer . 
Progressive second degree heart block throughout day after the procedure with HR transiently dropping to 3 0 s although BP stable . 
Resited RIJ to left cordis / trauma line and placed temp transvenous pacer . 
However , she developed septic picture and permanent hardware was not able to be placed in that setting ( see sepsis , below ) . 
Patient had sedation weaned and did not regain consciousness . 
In the setting of increasing leukocytosis , worsening renal failure , anasarca , and acute wound dehiscence at her groin puncture sites extending deep into the groin tissue , patient was transitioned to comfort measures only per the wishes of her family on the morning of [ * * 2 1 1 6 - 1 2 - 2 8 * * ] .

In the unit the MAPS have been btw 5 5 - 7 0 with SBP of 7 7 - 9 4 and DBP of 4 8 - 6 0 . 
Probable causes are cardiogenic ( previous MI with non - contractile myocardium , SVT / VT , valvular dxs ) , hypovolemia , anemia , sepsis , hypothyroidism , non - compliance to medication ) . 
Pt was started on levophed but in setting of VT / arrythmia with increased ectopy this was changed to neosynephrine . 
Probable causes for decompensation include arrythmias , hypovolemia , anemia . 
Repeat echo shows decline in EF : [ * * Month ( only ) * * ] / 1 2 - 1 0 - 1 5 % , from 3 0 - 3 5 % in [ * * 2 1 1 4 * * ] . 
Diuresis was attempted with lasix but was minimally successful . 
Diuretics then held in setting of hypotension . 
ACEI and Bblocker also held in setting of hypotension .

Groin wounds developed secondary to femoral catheterization . 
Pain controlled with methadone . 
She reports having had nausea and vomiting for three days last week with subsequent improvement over the week . 
She had similar episode of nausea / vomiting yesterday which led her daughters to bring her to the the [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] today . 
She reports no sick contacts , eating outside , fever , chills , change in bowel movement , chest pain , shortness of breath or dysuria . 
In the ED , she was noted to have bradycardia in 5 0 s , hypotensive to 6 9 / 5 4 and finger stick of 1 2 3 . 
Labs significant for acute kidney injury with creatinine of 3 . 3 ( baseline of 1 . 1 ) and hematocrit of 2 5 . 5 ( basline in mid 3 0 s ) . 
She was given glucagon 5 mg bolus x 1 without change in her rate or blood pressure . 
She was subsequently transferred to CCU for further evaluation and management . 
In the CCU , she reported no complaints . 
She was given IV atropine 1 mg x 1 which improved her heart rate and blood pressure . 
She was started on dopamine gtt at 5 mcg / kg / min which improved her heart rate but did not improve her blood pressure .

Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - Independent . 
Discharge Instructions : It was a pleasure caring for you at the [ * * Hospital 1 8 2 7 * * ] . 
Your blood pressure and heart rate were low because you had too much atenolol ( a beta - blocker ) in your system in the setting of decreased blood flow to your kidney potentially caused by another medication ( valsartan or losartan ) . 
You subsequently had trouble breathing and needed to to be intubated . 
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed no evidence of coronary artery disease . 
We made the following changes to your medications : 1 ) Stop taking atenolol and instead start taking metoprolol tartrate 5 0 mg by mouth twice a day to better control your blood pressure . 
Followup Instructions : - Please call Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] ( Cardiology ) ( [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 2 0 3 7 * * ] for a follow - up appointment in 2 weeks time . 
The patient ' s current history starts [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 7 - 1 5 * * ] , when he was hospitalized at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ( requiring a brief ICU stay ) for left upper lobe pneumonia , treated with levofloxacin X 7 day course . 
He was discharged home with [ * * Hospital 1 2 6 9 * * ] , but around [ * * 7 - 2 5 * * ] he started having hypoxia ( resting O 2 sat of 9 5 % , ambulatory O 2 sat of 8 5 % ) , and also had cloudy urine . 
He was treated with Ciprofloxacin X 2 - 3 days for UTI , but because his hypoxia persisted and he had progressively worse dyspnea , he was admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 7 - 2 7 * * ] . 
A new right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on CXR during that admission , which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia . 
Patient was evaluated by Speech and Swallow who felt he had silent aspirations . 
He was treated with an 8 day course of broad antibiotics ( Vancomycin and Zosyn ) which ended on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 8 - 4 * * ] . 
He was discharged to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] on the 2 0 th , but on the 2 1 st he was sent to the [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] because his O 2 sats were down in the 8 0 s . 
At the OSH , a CT chest was performed that showed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changes and a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe . 
Patient received 4 days of levofloxacin IV . 
On the 2 4 th , the patient and his family requested transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further management of his treatment because this is where he gets the majority of his treatment . 
Of note , the CTA chest from [ * * 7 - 1 5 * * ] states : " Extensive consolidation involving the left upper lobe , could represent infection . 
Also , since the patient ' s discharge from first admission , on [ * * 7 - 2 0 * * ] there has been concerns regarding ongoing altered mental status . 
For a while , the patient ' s wife had to have friends take turns supervising him at home when she was out . 
Geriatrics was involved during the patient ' s last [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] admission for difficult to manage delirium which was felt somewhat more consistent with that of acute brain injury . 
Psychiatry at [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] saw the patient during his current admission and felt he was delirious from ongoing hypoxia , and pulmonary disease . 
Prior to his presentation to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 7 - 1 5 * * ] , the patient had been functional and travelling through [ * * Country 1 8 0 8 4 * * ] where he climbed up to Edinburgh Castle . 
Upon transfer to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , the patient was stable . 
When interviewed , however , he was alert and oriented X 2 but not making much sense in his answers . 
When asked about his symptoms , he would talk about his coming from [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] many years ago . 
He did endorse trouble breathing and anxiety . 
The RN noted he coughed up mucous with blood . 
Review of systems : Difficult to get an accurate ROS as patient ' s responses do not make sense . 
H / o drinking [ * * 2 - 1 8 * * ] pints of beer daily for nearly 2 0 years . 
Cut down 3 - 4 years ago , drinking one glass daily . 
Both parents died of CVA ? ? ? ? ? ? s . 
Physical Exam : Vitals : T : afebrile BP : 1 1 7 / 7 1 P : 7 6 R : 1 8 O 2 : 9 4 % on 4 L General : Alert , oriented , no acute distress HEENT : Sclera anicteric , dry mouth , EOMI Neck : supple , JVP not elevated , no hepatojugular reflux Lungs : Expiratory crackles present in lower lung bases , L > R , no wheezing / rhonchi / rales CV : irregularly irregular . 
No murmurs / gallops / rubs Abdomen : soft , non - tender , non - distended , BS + Ext : Warm , well perfused , no peripheral edema , no cyanosis / ecchymosis . 
Respiratory failure worsened during his hospital course despite treatments . 
He was made CMO and terminally extubated on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 8 - 2 7 * * ] . 
The patient died at 7 : 0 3 pm . 
We began treatment of LUL pneumonia empirically with levofloxacin ( for CAP coverage ) , vancomycin ( HAP coverage ) , and cefepime ( for pseudomonal coverage ) . 
On the second day of hospitalization , levofloxacin was stopped and he was continued on vanc / cef for total of a 1 4 day course . 
Due to the fact that his pneumonia was not improving since his original diagnosis [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 7 - 1 5 * * ] , pulmonology was consulted . 
Urine legionella was negative , LDH was elevated at 3 9 2 . 
A CT of the Chest on [ * * 8 - 9 * * ] showed marked worsening of nonspecific multifocal ground - glass opacities and consolidations predominantly involving the left upper , right upper , left lower and portions of the right lower lobes of infectious v . inflammatory v . hemorrhagic etiology . 
Bronchoscopy on [ * * 8 - 1 4 * * ] was grossly normal , no signs of hemorrhage ( only abnormality small nonobstructing membrane extending about one - third of the way into the airway lumen in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe ) . 
BAL showed hemosiderin - laden macrophages and multinucleated histiocytes and was negative for malignant cells , PCP , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) 1 8 0 9 2 * * ] , and CMV , and was significant only for 1 + PMNs and 1 0 - 1 0 0 K yeast , most likely colonizer ) . 
Blood cultures were negative x 5 , HIV was negative , aspergillus negative , hepatitis serologies were negative . 
Infectious w / u was significant only for a positive serum beta glucan ( 1 6 3 ) , and at time of transfer to the MICU cryptococcus and quantiferon gold were pending . 
Inflammatory w / u negative for anti - GBM negative , complement normal , ANCA negative , ESR elevated at 6 0 . 
He completed a 1 4 day course of vanc / cef without improvement in pulmonary status . 
Repeat chest CT on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] showed interval progression of multifocal consolidations , likely representing infections , although inflammatory condition is a possibility as well as new small bilateral pleural effusions . 
He was again started on 4 0 mg IV lasix daily with appropriate diuresis . 
Infectious disease was consulted on [ * * 8 - 2 1 * * ] and recommended VATS for definitive diagnosis as it was not felt that the underlying pulmonary process represented an infectious etiology , however he was not deemed to be a surgical candidate due to his many comorbidities . 
Per chest CT , there was concern that the ground glass opacities on repeat chest CT may represent usual interstitial pneumonitis , the treatment of which would be steroids . 
On [ * * 8 - 2 1 * * ] he was started on empiric IV solumedrol 8 0 mg TID which was tapered to 8 0 mg IV BID on [ * * 8 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Repeat CXR on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] showed no significant change from prior and plans were for steroid taper . 
Throughout hospital stay , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was on supplementary O 2 as needed , incentive spirometry , and albuterol / ipratropium nebs . 
O 2 was weaned and sats were consistently in the low 9 0 s on room air and in the mid - high 9 0 s on 2 L O 2 NC . 
The likely etiology of his delirium was considered his ongoing infection + / - hospitalizations . 
UA was performed and was negative , a UCx showed no growth , which ruled out UTI as the cause of delirium . 
A CT head at last admission was negative for any intracranial process and repeat head CT on [ * * 8 - 1 9 * * ] , obtained after an unwitnessed fall from bed with no signs of trauma again showed no acute intracranial process , again showed small vessel ischemic disease , unchanged old lacunar infarcts in the bilateral basal ganglia and extreme capsule , and prominent ventricles and sulci . 
On admission he was initially given Olanzapine 5 mg po q 6 h PRN agitation and haldol . 
Geriatrics follwoed the patient for management of his persistent delerium and sundowning and per their recommendations olanzapine was swithced to seroquel and uptitrated to 1 2 . 5 QAM and 3 7 . 5 QHS with PRN seroquel and haldol . 
Delerium was also managed with soft restraints and cage bed in order to keep Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] from injuring staff and pulling out his lines . 
Neurology was consulted on admission and initially felt his confusion was due to his underlying pulmonary process . 
However , when he failed to improve despite antibiotics and no source of infection was identified , they were reconsulted on [ * * 8 - 2 1 * * ] and recommended LP , MRI w / and w / o contrast , and EEG due to concern for limibic encephalitis vs . paraneoplastic process vs . temporal lobe epilepsy . 
Patient is not a candidate for MRI due to his Zenith AAA stent graft . 
At the time of transfer LP had so far shown normal glucose , protein , and WBC , no organisms on Gram stain , no growth on preliminary bacterial , fungal , and acid fast cultures , negative cryptococcal antigen . 
CSF HSV and VDRL pending at time of transfer . 
Anti - [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] antibodies were negative . 
Serum RPR and [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] - [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] antibody panel , and 1 , 2 5 vitamin D were pending . 
Patient was also undergoing EEG monitoring at the time of transfer . 
He was initially continued on his home Lasix 4 0 mg po qd for CHF management , and medical management was continued with continued Carvedilol and Losartan . 
His lasix was discontinued for several days due to worsening delerium and no IV access and NPO status . 
Repeat chest CT on It was restarted intermittently at 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
On [ * * 8 - 1 9 * * ] a loud MR murmur was noted on physical exam and repeat TTE was poor quality and showed EF of 3 0 - 3 5 % , question of worsening MR , and antero / anterolateral hypokinesis . 
He was a poor historian and intermittently [ * * Month / Day ( 1 ) 1 2 8 6 1 * * ] substernal chest pain . 
EKGs demonstrated TWI in the anterior , anterolateral , and inferolateral leads . 
On the morning of transfer , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 1 2 8 6 1 * * ] [ * * 4 - 2 4 * * ] substernal chest pressure , as he had intermittently reported throughout hospitalization and cardiac enzymes were again checked and showed troponin 0 . 0 2 ( down from prior ) and ECG showed no significant change from baseline . 
Patient had an elevated INR ( 3 . 8 ) on admission with no evidence of acute bleed , so coumadin was held but rate control was continued with carvedilol . 
His carvedilol dose was stopped and restarted after he developed an episode of A . fib with RVR on [ * * 8 - 1 3 * * ] . 
INR trended down and coumadin was again started on [ * * 8 - 1 4 * * ] at a low dose of 2 mg daily . 
It was deemed to be safely stopped on [ * * 8 - 1 6 * * ] in preparation for G - J tube placement in IR , as the patient had no reported history of stroke , and patient was given one dose of 1 mg of IV vitamin K on [ * * 9 - 1 * * ] and [ * * 8 - 2 2 * * ] ( 3 mg total ) . 
Warfarin has been held since [ * * 8 - 1 8 * * ] . 
We continued home Losartan 1 0 0 mg Tablet until [ * * 8 - 1 8 * * ] when Cr bumped . 
We continued soft diet and nectar thick fluid with aspiration precautions . 
Video swallow on [ * * 8 - 1 1 * * ] showed aspiration of all consistencies and he was made NPO . 
Repeat video swallow on [ * * 8 - 1 5 * * ] again showed florid aspiration . 
On [ * * 8 - 2 1 * * ] he was allowed to take sips and eat a dysphagia diet because he had been NPO for 1 0 days , had poor IV access , and had not tolerated multiple attempts at dobhoff placement on the floor and G - J placement in the IR suite . 
It was also felt that his underlying lung process was due to a significantly more severe process than aspiration alone . 
He was also started on PPN on the evening of [ * * 8 - 2 2 * * ] and received intermittent PPN . 
On the evening of transfer he was permitted to receive supervised milkshake spoon - feeding administered at bedside by his daughter . 
He was spoon fed water and intermittently received up D 5 W with improvement in his Na to 1 4 4 on the day of transfer ( [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] ) . 
A true vanc trough the following morning was elevated at 4 2 . 
Vancomycin was d / c ' d and the patient was hydrated with D 5 1 / 2 NS . 
His creatinine remained elevated , FeNa was < 0 . 1 % on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] , and his [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] and lasix continued to be held until the patient triggered on the evening of [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] , prompting him to receive 4 0 mg of IV lasix prior to transfer to the MICU . 
He has a concurrent eosinophilia ( 1 4 . 3 % ) . 
Biopsy was consistent with leukocytoclastic vaculitis . 
Ddx included vasculitis vs . drug reaction . 
He had started cefepime 3 - 4 days prior to the rash . 
He was continued on cefepime and the rash resolved as did the eosinophilia ( 5 . 5 % when last checked on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] ) . 
LFTs trended down , statin was restarted . 
LFTs inadvertently checked [ * * 8 - 2 3 * * ] , mildly elevated again , statin held . 
Medications on Admission : 1 . 
Warfarin 2 . 5 mg daily 2 . 
Carvedilol 1 2 . 5 mg Tablet twice daily 3 .

Olanzapine 2 . 5 mg Tablet , Rapid Dissolve q 6 h PRN severe agitation . 
Per OSH also reported fevers , chills , and nausea . 
Had gveen given bactrim for a UTI one week prior . 
He underwent an abdomen CT which showed intrahepatic and extrahepatic obstruction likely secondary to metastatic cancer to the pancreatic head . 
He was started on flagyl , zosyn , and vanc and transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for ERCP . 
While being prepped for ERCP ( while under MAC ) and turned prone he regurgitated coffee - brown material so he was electively intubated due to concern for his risk of aspiration . 
They proceded with ERCP , but were unable to cannulate the biliary tree . 
A dudodenal stent was placed due to external compression of the duodenum . 
He was placed on propofol for sedation and his SBP ' s dropped to the 8 0 ' s in the PACU . 
He was started on neo through a PIV for pressure support . 
In the ICU the neo was rapidly weaned and he was extubated easily [ * * 1 1 - 5 * * ] . 
It was thought that his inability to extubate post - procedure and hypotension were due to sedation rather than aspiration given his rapid improvement .

MRSA screen [ * * 1 1 - 4 * * ] : pending . 
CXR port [ * * 1 1 - 4 * * ] : Lung volumes are quite low . 
With the chin down , the tip of the ET tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is 3 cm above optimal placement . 
A band of atelectasis is present at the base of the right lung which is otherwise clear . 
Heart is mildly enlarged . 
No pneumothorax . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right , are likely present . 
An apparent bulge in the right mediastinal contour could be a skin fold instead . 
Repeat radiographs , conventional if possible , recommended when feasible . 
ERCP [ * * 1 1 - 4 * * ] : A large amount of gastric fluid was found when the endoscope was passed into the stomach , suggestive of outflow tract obstruction . 
Unable to pass the scope to the second part of the duodenum due to obstruction , most likely extrinsic compression from colon cancer metastases . 
A duodenal stent ( 9 cm x 2 2 mm Wallflex enteral duodenal stent ) was placed successfully under fluoroscopic guidance to alleviate the gastric outlet obstruction . 
Ref 6 5 0 2 . 
Lot [ * * Numeric Identifier 2 5 8 0 3 * * ] ( stent placement ) . 
Fluoro [ * * 1 1 - 6 * * ] : IMPRESSION : Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating moderate intra - and extra - hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with obstruction of the common bile duct at the level of the ampulla . 
Likely secondary to propofol , however also in the differential is hypotension from sepsis . 
He has two potential sources for sepsis : biliary obstruction and recent apsiration . 
Also could have volume depletion . 
Since coming to the floor his pressures had recovered and phenylephrine weaned off . 
Given the possibility of sepsis , he was started on vancomycin , flagyl and cefepime , but then changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl . 
The vancomycin was discontinued after the cultures were negative x 4 8 horus . 
On the day before discharge he was transitioned to PO levofloxacin to complete a full course through [ * * 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] , cultures no growth to date at discharge . 
He failed ERCP due to external compression of the duodenum limiting their ability to pass the scope . 
A duodenal stent was placed by the ERCP team to help to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction . 
Given the failed ERCP attempt , IR was consulted and performed an IR guided biliary drain on [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 1 1 - 6 * * ] . 
He was transferred to the floor and his LFTs trended down after the stent was placed . 
His drain was clamped on [ * * 1 1 - 8 * * ] and with continued improvement of his liver tests and symptoms . 
He was discharged with a clamped biliary drain to follow up with interventional radiology . 
If symptoms return , the drain can be unclamped to a bag . 
On the following morning he was successfully extubated and breathing appropriately on room air . 
He was anemic with a Hct of 2 6 at the OSH and 2 5 on admission labs here . 
Vit B 1 2 and folate normal at the OSH . 
Fe low , but other Fe studies not sent . 
Haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely . 
Most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due to oncologic treatment . 
Started an IV PPI due to concern for coffee ground regurgitant . 
His hematocrits were stable and did not need transfusions . 
He will follow up with his outpatient surgeon after discharge .

You went for a procedure that stented open your small bowel allowing you to eat liquids and solids . 
You then went to the have a drain placed in your biliary duct in order to the relieve the obstruction . 
Resume all of your home medications except Lipitor , until follow up with your doctors . 
You will need to continue the levofloxacin for 7 days until [ * * 2 1 9 9 - 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] . 
You will need to follow up with your primary surgeon and your primary care doctor . 
Additionally , interventional radiology will contact you to follow up with your drain management . 
Return to the hospital if you experience fevers / chills , abdominal pain , recurring jaundice , or any other concerning symptoms . 
Followup Instructions : As above , you will need to follow up with your primary surgeon , Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 2 5 8 0 4 * * ] when you return home , as well as with your PCP [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
You will also need to follow up with the interventional radiology department in order to change the drain in 3 months . 
They will contact you to schedule this . 
CHF exacerbation was in the setting of new inferior HK and he was diuresed with hopes of pursuing RHC / LHC . 
Hospital course was complicated by [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] ( Cr > 3 . 0 ) , PIV - associated MSSA bacteremia ( did not want [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] dc ' ed on IV nafcillin x 4 weeks ) . 
RHC was done and showed elevated filling pressures , so he was transferred to the CCU for Milrinone to assist with Lasix gtt . 
Due to infection , he was only on milrinone for a few hours . 
He was transferred back to the floor and was diuresed well prior to discharge . 
He followed up in clinic on [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 0 - 2 7 * * ] and was found to have creatinine elevated to 5 . 4 despite holding torsemide on [ * * 1 0 - 2 2 * * ] ( took it [ * * 1 0 - 2 7 * * ] ) .

Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 0 - 2 9 * * ] , biventricular systolic function has decreased . 
Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures . 
The mean RA pressure was severely elevated at 1 8 mmHg , and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 2 2 mmHg . 
There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 8 0 / 3 3 mmHg and a mean PA pressure of 4 9 mmHg .

The cardiac output and index were reduced at 4 . 3 L / min and 2 . 0 L / min / m 2 . 
The pulmonary vascular resistance was moderately elevated at 3 1 6 dyne - sec / cm 5 . 
Ultrasound of the right internal juggular vein suggested thrombus which is possibly related to the patient ' s right sided PICC line , however subsequent imaging indicated no thrombus but RIJ very medially displaced . 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS : 1 . 
Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures . 
Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension . 
Reduced cardiac output / index . 
Moderately elevated PVR . 
Possible thrombus in the right internal jugular vein which was not confirmed by subsequent studies which showed RIJ very medially displaced . 
Yesterday ' s mild pulmonary edema has resolved . 
There is no pneumothorax , pleural effusion or mediastinal widening . 
Heart is top normal size , unchanged over the long term . 
Also unchanged since at least [ * * 1 0 - 1 9 * * ] are fractures of the two uppermost sternal wires , which developed sometime after [ * * 2 1 8 6 - 4 - 2 6 * * ] when non - fusion of the manubrium was already evident radiographically . 
Specifically , there is no evidence of pneumothorax . 
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs . 
PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Heart size is enlarged in a globular manner , unchanged . 
Mediastinum is stable . 
Multiple broken sternal wires are redemonstrated . 
As compared to the prior study , there is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema , currently mild . 
There is also improvement in more focal right upper lobe opacity . 
Prominence of pulmonary arteries is demonstrated , most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension . 
No appreciable pleural effusion is seen . 
Small right renal nonobstructing stone . 
Acute on chronic renal failure : Baseline Cr 2 . 1 , presented last admission at 2 . 5 , and presented at this admission with creatinine 5 . 4 in clinic . 
His renal function fluctuated , and he was initially managed with 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] torsemide . 
However , he did not respond well and had worsening renal function . 
Accordingly , he underwent R heart cath , which showed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures , severe pulmonary hypertension and depressed CO / CI . 
He was admitted to the CCU for milrinone drip and more aggressive diuresis . 
On admission , urine studies suggested pre - renal cause of [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] ( FEurea 4 4 % is indeterminate , FENa 0 . 8 6 % ) . 
Torsemide had been held between hospital admissions . 
Nephrology was consulted and recommended cefazolin to substitute for Nafcillin ( though due to the short time period , they did not believe [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] was consistent with nafcillin - associated acute interstitial nephritis and urine eosinophils were positive . 
Sarna lotion and hydroxyzine were given for symptomatic relief of uremia - related pruritus . 
Pt ' s Cr trended down to mid 3 s , plateaued and then steadily rised . 
After pt was switched from milrinone drip to dobutamine drip as well as optimized afterload reduction with hydralazine and Isordil , Cr consistently trended down . 
Upon discharge , Cr was 3 . 3 . . 
Acute on chronic CHF : Due to continued weight gain and poor response , he underwent a R heart cath [ see above ] . 
Pt ' s beta blocker was restarted at a low dose and then later on discontinued as pt was in decompensated HF and later on put on dobutamine drip . 
Afterload reduction was successful while up titrating hydralazine and Isordil . 
Upon discharge , pt ' s BP was ranging 1 3 0 - 1 4 0 . 
Heart failure team believed CHF is both related to significant dyssynchrony and contractility issues , both most likely related to ischemia . 
Pt was diuresed aggressively throughout course initially with Lasix drip and then transitioned to IV Lasix boluses with goal of [ * * 3 - 1 2 * * ] . 5 L negative in 2 4 h using 1 2 0 mg boluses . 
Pt was transitioned to 1 0 0 mg Torsemide at discharge . 
Dyssynchrony component of HF was addressed with attempting to place CRT - D . 
Unfortunately , coronary sinus could not be accessed successfully and thus LV lead was not placed . 
Contractility was addressed with dobutamine drip which pt was discharged with . 
After starting dobutamine infusion , EF improved from 2 0 to 3 0 % on TTE . 
Pt will need to followup with EP in order to access LV for appropriate resynchronization and will probably have a cardiac catheterization to assess coronaries . 
Peripheral IV - associated MSSA bacteremia : - Changed nafcillin to cefazolin per ID recs ; he underwent a [ * * Date Range * * ] this admission , which did not show any valvular vegetations . 
As a result , he underwent a shortened course of IV antibiotics ( 2 weeks ) , which ended on [ * * 2 1 9 5 - 1 1 - 2 * * ] . 
Pt remained afebrile and stable thereafter . 
Loose stools - Recent hospital stay could raise concern for C . diff ( pt nauseous , but no f / c ) . 
Per patient , he feels that loose stools began w / nafcillin . 
Either way , may contribute to pre - renal cause of [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] ( along with recent poor intake ) . 
Loose stools resolved after stopping nafcillin . 
In addition , he was c . diff negative . 
TTE on prior showed new inferior HK . 
He was continued on ASA , Pravastatin , and beta blocker ( Metoprolol changed to Carvedilol ) . 
In the future he needs L heart catheterization in order to assess grafts / native vessels . 
Pt was continued on ASA and statin . 
Carvedilol was ultimately held given decompensated heart failure and pt put on dobutamine infusion . 
Neuropathic & venous stasis ulcers : Pt was seen by wound care specialist during hospitalization . 
Ulcers appeared to heal more optimally when LE edema decreased with aggressive diuresis . 
Pt is to followup with PCP to continue DM management and may need referral to vascular surgery if ulcers persist or worsen . 
Diabetes mellitus : Stable on ISS , and discharged with Lantus 4 4 u at bedtime with ISS . 
Iron studies showed low level of iron and pt was given 5 days of ferric gluconate IV 1 2 5 mg to replete iron deficit . 
Pt ' s anemia was stable thereafter and discharged with hct of 2 8 . 1 . 
This was attributed to Vitamin K deficiency secondary to antibiotic use , malnutrition and malabsorption from congested bowels related to decompensated CHF . 
DIC labs were not remarkable . 
Pt ' s elevated INR was refractory to PO Vit K which supported hypothesis of congestion in GI tract causing malabsorption issues . 
As pt ' s nutrition improved and preload reduction , INR trended down to 1 . 4 at time of discharge . 
Pt was followed by nutrition during stay and would benefit from outpt nutrition management . 
Information was obtained from webOMR .

[ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] in Orthopedics on Thursday , [ * * 4 - 4 * * ] , at 1 0 : 0 0 am on the [ * * Location ( un ) 1 3 8 5 * * ] of the [ * * Hospital Ward Name 2 3 * * ] Clinical Center at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
Please call his office at ( [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 2 0 0 7 * * ] if there are any problems with this appointment . 
Initally the patient was hypotensive with SBP in the 8 0 s . 
The patient was given fluids and was transfused 2 U of FFP and 2 U of PRBC . 
Only poor peripheral access was obtained ( 2 0 G in foot ) and therefore a CVL was attempted . 
An attempt for a R femoral line was unsuccessful . 
A RIJ attempt was unsuccessful as the wire was traveling in the head . 
When trying to place a L subclavian line , the physician in the OSH was unable to withdraw the wire . 
A CXR revealed the CVL wire coiled in the IVC filter . 
The patient is transfered for IR intervention to withdraw the wire . 
On arrival to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , the patient denied any CP , SOB , abdominal pain , back pain . 
She denied any BRBPR prior to this episode . 
She states that the BRBPR started last two days . 
The patient denies ever having had any colonoscopy before . 
She denies any LH or dizziness . 
The patient is s / p recent THR that was complicated by a DVT . 
The pt had an IVC filter placed and was on Heparin sc TID for DVT prophylaxis . 
Past Medical History : PMH : Rheumatoid Arthritis - c / b chronic right pleural effusion , s / p recent thoracentesis , felt to be due to RA HTN Atrial fibrillation h / o of CVA with residual L sided weakness Frequent UTIs . 
Readmitted in [ * * 6 - 1 4 * * ] with thigh pain and a DVT was seen . 
On lovenox , plavix and aspirin , she developed a thigh hematoma complicated by hypotension , so anticoagulation was stopped and they placed an IVC filter . 
She was D / C ' d to [ * * Location ( un ) 9 3 1 * * ] House . 
She was readmitted [ * * 8 - 1 5 * * ] for chest pain and hypotension and found to have RA pericarditis , pericardial effusion , and pleuritis . 
Placed on steroids . 
Readmitted [ * * 1 0 - 1 5 * * ] for the same and also developed A fib which spontaneously recovered . 
Readmitted [ * * 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] from rehab because she was placed on heparin SQ despite the IVCF and developed BRBPR and hypotension . 
Social History : She has been living in a Rehab since her THR in [ * * 9 - 1 4 * * ] . 
Prior to this , she lived alone with help from her son . 
She denies ETOH and tobacco use . 
Subsegmental atelectasis right base . 
Increased density in the retrocardiac area , which may represent atelectasis or consolidation . 
CT Abdomen / Pelvis : 1 . 
CT colonography unable to be performed due to lack of rectal tone . 
Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis . 
Assessment of the nondistended colon is limited , but there is an area of asymmetric wall thickening with mucosal enhancement in a loop of redundant sigmoid colon low in the left lower quadrant . 
While this could be related to recent colonoscopy or represent inflammatory changes from diverticulosis , given the history of GI bleeding , a neoplastic process cannot be excluded . 
Targeted colonoscopy of this area or single - contrast barium enema could be performed for further assessment . 
Given lack rectal tone , single contrast enema may not be successful . 
Findings consistent with proctitis . 
Air in the bladder . 
Correlate with recent history of Foley catheter placement . 
Given extensive diverticular disease , in the absence of prior Foley catheterization , this would raise suspicion for enterovesicular fistula . 
No areas of asymmetric bladder wall thickening are identified adjacent to sigmoid colon to indicate an enterovesicular fistula . 
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis . 
Brief Hospital Course : A / P : [ * * Age over 9 0 * * ] F with PMH of RA , THR c / b DVT , s / p IVC filter placement , admitted to MICU with LGIB . 
She received 2 units of FFP and 2 units of PRBC ' s at outside hospital and was subsequently transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further management . 
She was admitted to the MICU at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] and GoLytely was administered in preparation for a colonoscopy . 
On admission to this institution , she had a large drop in her hct from 3 3 . 8 to 2 6 . 6 and was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBC ' s and started on IV PPI . 
She was subsequently hemodynamically stable for the duration of her hospital course . 
EGD / colonoscopy revealed ischemic - appearing mucosa in the sigmoid colon and severe sigmoid narrowing , which they were unable to pass with the colonoscope . 
This study revealed severe sigmoid diverticulosis and findings consistent with proctitis . 
If indeed these findings are consistent ischemic colitis , it may be related to hypotensive event ( reported per PCP ) which occurred at outside hospital . 
At time of discharge , she was hemodynamically stable , and no further intervention was advised . 
This was discussed with both patient ' s son and her PCP who stated their agreement with plan for conservative management . 
IR found that in fact this was not the case , and they were able to remove the wire without difficulty . 
A left SVC triple lumen catheter was placed by IR for access in the setting of active GI bleeding , as patient had a tenuous situation with peripheral IV ' s . 
Current dose of 2 0 mg was continued to prevent adrenal insufficiency . 
Her PCP will continue to manage the slow taper after discharge . 
No clinical , radiographic , or other laboratory evidence of infection . 
Once GI bleeding had subsided , it was restarted . 
Heart rate was well - controlled . 
She is not currently a candidate for anticoagulation given GI bleed . 
Following colonoscopy , diet was slowly advanced from clear liquids to regular cardiac diet , which patient tolerated well . 
Electrolytes were repleted as needed to maintain K > 4 , Mg > 2 . 
Patient has IVC filter in place given h / o DVT . 
PPI for GI prophylaxis . 
Home Meds : included sq heparin . 
Atorvastatin 1 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO DAILY ( Daily ) .

Prednisone 2 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO DAILY ( Daily ) . 
Sotalol 8 0 mg Tablet Sig : 0 . 5 Tablet PO DAILY ( Daily ) . 
You were evaluated by Interventional Radiology , and the catheter was disentangled . 
You have also been evaluated for the source of your GI bleeding . 
Initially you received a blood transfusion to stabilize your hematocrit . 
Your colonoscopy showed evidence of diverticulosis and of ischemia in your sigmoid colon ( which means that your bowel may not be getting adequate blood supply to it ) . 
Ischemic colitis is likely the source of your lower GI bleed . 
There is no further intervention necessary for these conditions . 
Your bleeding has subsided , and you have been hemodynamically stable for several days . 
You should return to the hospital if you experience gross blood in your stool , shortness of breath , or chest pain .

Brief Hospital Course : The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service with duodenal perforation status post ERCP . 
The patient was made NPO with NGT , started on IV fluids and IV Zosyn , and Dilaudid PCA for pain control . 
CT scan on HD # 2 demonstrated large amount of fluid in the right anterior and posterior pararenal spaces tracking down to the lower quadrant of the abdomen and large amount of free air . 
Nutritional consult was called for TPN recommendations and PICC line was placed . 
The patient continued to spike low grade fever and her blood cultures were positive for STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS , Vancomycin Iv was added on HD # 6 . 
The patient continued to spike fever and IR drainage of the right retroperitoneal fluid collection was ordered . 
The patient underwent CT - guided percutaneous drainage catheter placement into the right perinephric space on HD # 6 and fluid was sent for cultures . 
The patient ' s diet was advanced as tolerated on POD # 8 , and was well tolerated . 
The cultures were positive for [ * * Female First Name ( un ) 5 6 4 * * ] Albicans and IV Fluconazole was added . 
The decision was made to take the patient in OR for washout . 
On [ * * 2 1 1 2 - 3 - 2 0 * * ] , the patient underwent wide incision and drainage of retroperitoneal abscess / infection / hematoma , [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] patch of potential duodenal perforation region with drainage and antecolic isoperistaltic side - to - side gastrojejunostomy and JP drains placement x 4 , which went well without complication ( reader referred to the Operative Note for details ) . 
Intraoperatively patient received 2 units of pRBC , she was extubated post op and was transferred in ICU for observation . 
On POD # 2 , patient received 2 units of pRBC for HCT 2 3 . 4 , her post transfusion Hct was 2 8 . 3 . 
The patient was transferred to the floor on POD # 3 , NPO on TPN and IV fluids , and Dilaudid PCA for pain control . 
The patient was continued to have low grade fever and she was continued on IV Vancomycin , Zosyn and Fluconazole . 
The patient was hydrodynamically stable . 
Neuro : The patient is an active Heroin user . 
Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA and she had high requirements for pain medication . 
When tolerating oral intake , the patient was transitioned to oral Dilaudid and Chronic Pain Service was consulted . 
The patient ' s pain medications was weaned to [ * * 1 - 1 4 * * ] gm of Dilaudid PO Q 4 H and patient instructed to continue wean off her pain medications in home . 
CV : The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint ; vital signs were routinely monitored . 
Pulmonary : The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint ; vital signs were routinely monitored . 
Good pulmonary toilet , early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization . 
GI : The patient was started on TPN on admission . 
Her diet was advanced to clears on HD # 6 and to regular on HD # 8 . 
The patient was made NPO prior surgery and TPN was continued . 
Diet was advanced to clears on POD # 5 and to regular on POD # 9 , TPN was weaned off and d / c / d on POD # 8 . 
The patient was able to tolerate regular diet prior discharge . 
Electrolytes were routinely followed , and repleted when necessary . 
Renal / GU : The patient ' s Cre / BUN were monitored routinely , on HD # 2 1 ( POD # 1 0 ) her Cre increased to 1 . 9 . 
During hospitalization patient underwent several abdominal CT scans with contrast , she received IV Vancomycin x 1 4 days , and she received IV Toradol for pain control . 
The combination of these factors and inflammatory respond from fluid collection , which lead to mild right kidney hydronephrosis contributed to patient ' s acute renal injury .

She is a 7 7 - year - old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 1 0 0 - pack years quitting approximately eight years ago . 
She suffers from hypertension , hyperlipidemia , glucose intolerance , and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD . 
She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain , and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine . 
She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler . 
With these treatments , her dyspnea improved , but would worsen as the steroids were tapered . 
She does report some episodes of chest heaviness , which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest , which will last for minutes at a time . 
These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week . 
She was placed on Nexium with some improvement , but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes . 
To further evaluate her symptoms of persistent cough and shortness of breath , she underwent a CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolus . 
This was performed on 0 5 / 2 0 / 2 1 0 1 and did not show any evidence of PE , however , there was coronary artery calcification with plaque noted in the left main coronary artery . 
There was a focal 9 mm aneurysm of the right coronary artery . 
She was then referred to me for further evaluation . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
Glucose intolerance . 
Left bundle branch block . 
Diverticular bleed . 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease . 
Hypothyroidism . 
COPD . 
Mother with " an enlarged heart , " who died at 8 2 . 
She lives alone but her daughter lives above her in the same building . 
She has intermittent headaches relieved with Advil . 
She reports chronic cough and wheeze , which has been improved on prednisone . 
She has shortness of breath with exertion but denies exertional chest pain . 
No lower extremity edema , palpitations , or dizzy spells . 
She reports her reflux symptoms are improved on her Nexium . 
She has no history of stroke , no history of anemia . 
She reports her sugars have been diet controlled . 
Otherwise extended review of systems was negative . 
She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare , which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy . 
Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm . 
I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study , and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high - risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan . 
She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD . 
Adenosine MIBI to evaluate for ischemia in distributions of the left system as well as the RCA aneurismal segment . 
Treatment of her emphysema as per your office . 
I will see her again in follow up in one month and consider cardiac catheterization for further evaluation . 
I have instructed her to proceed to the emergency room with the development of any significant chest pain or progressive shortness of breath . 
Briefly , 7 8 YO female with recent hip fracture in 8 / 0 1 ( not surgically repaired ) who did well until 3 days PTA when she developed sudden onset CP , non - productive cough and was noted to have RA sat of 8 9 % .

She initially presented ~ 3 weeks ago with neck / swallowing pain and was found to have the above abscess on CT imaging , which was drained and cultures ultimately grew beta streptococcus group A and propionobacterium acnes . 
She was treated with meropenem for this ( changed to ertapenem upon discharge ) . 
Her initial hospitalization ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 6 1 4 3 6 * * ] ) was complicated by intubation for airway protection x several days , neutropenia ( WBC nadir 0 . 6 with 6 7 % neutrophils on [ * * 2 - 2 6 * * ] ) , anemia to Hct < 2 1 ( received 2 units pRBCs ) . 
She also developed left IJ nearly - occlusive clot , which was not felt to be septic in origin . 
After multispecialist discussion , the decision was made not to anticoagulate as risks were felt to outweigh benefits . 
She was seen by hematology during that admission and started on Neupogen , which was stopped when WBC count came > 3 5 0 0 .

Coronal , sagittal reformations were performed at 2 mm slice thickness . 
FINDINGS : Extensive soft tissue swelling throughout the superficial and deep spaces of the left neck and abnormal thickening and enhancement of the left sternocleidomastoid and posterior cervical muscles are again seen ( 2 : 2 9 ) . 
There is increased rim thickening and enhancement of an organizing fluid collection along the left neck extending posteriorly ( 2 : 3 3 ) since [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 2 - 2 8 * * ] , with a dominant collection measuring 3 4 x 7 mm ( 2 : 2 8 ) . 
Previously noted drains have been removed with subcutaneous gas likely reflecting packing material within a lateral incision ( 2 : 5 4 ) . 
No bony erosions are detected . 
There is improved retropharyngeal swelling with decreased mass effect on the neighboring airway , including slight restoration of the left piriform sinus and decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic fold and epiglottis . 
The airway remains patent . 
No new fluid collections are seen . 
There is no subcutaneous emphysema . 
Neighboring great vessels remain patent , although there is continued marked narrowing of the left internal jugular vein ( 2 : 3 4 ) as it passes through the area of inflammation in the left neck . 
Included views of the lung apices demonstrates minimal paraseptal emphysema ( 3 0 1 b : 6 8 ) . 
The thyroid is normal . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Organizing rim - enhancing fluid collection concerning for an abscess tracking along the left lateral and posterior neck , overall slightly worsened since [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 2 - 2 8 * * ] , with increased size of a dominant posterior collection measuring up to 8 mm , and increased thickeness of an enhancing rind . 
Improved retropharyngeal swelling with decreased mass effect on the neighboring airway , including slight restoration of the left piriform sinus and decreased swelling of the left aryepiglottic fold and epiglottis . 
Removal of surgical drains with subcutaneous gas in the left neck possibly reflecting packing material within the surgical incision . 
Continued severe focal narrowing the left internal jugular vein as it courses through the area of inflammation in the left neck .

The gallbladder is collapsed . 
Brief Hospital Course : 3 0 F hx [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] and idiopathic neutropenic who was recently d / c s / p neck I & D of an infected abscess , now readmitted with increased drain output and night sweats . 
Found with reaccumulated fluid collection and s / p I & D / washout on [ * * 3 - 1 4 * * ] . 
She was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged with a PICC line and continued ertapenem . 
She re - presented on [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 3 - 1 4 * * ] to the emergency room noting several days of increasing swelling around the surgical site with increasing drainage and pain , as well as night sweats and fevers . 
CT scan of the neck showed reaccumulation of fluid in her left cervical region concerning for worsening infection , and patient was taken emergently to OR by ENT for L neck exploration and incision and drainage . 
Procedure was well - tolerated and proceeded without issue ; 3 penrose drains were placed . 
No fevers / chills while in house and no signs of sepsis . 
Was able to protect airway , breath / swallow comfortably post - op . 
Per ID , it was not felt that this episode was antibiotic failure , so she was continued on meropenem . 
She continued to spike temps > 1 0 1 for the first few days post - op and eventually her fever curve downtrended . 
The penrose drains were removed every 1 - 2 days until the final drain was removed on [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 3 - 2 4 * * ] . 
Her wound and blood cultures did not grow any organisms . 
Pt was treated with meropenem while hospitalized with initial plan to switch to ertapenem 2 days prior to discharge . 
However , LFTs were found to be elevated on [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 3 - 2 4 * * ] and [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 3 - 2 5 * * ] , which ID felt may be due to ertapenem .

Warfarin 2 . 5 mg Tablet Sig : Two ( 2 ) Tablet PO at bedtime : Talk to your doctor about whether you should change your dose of warfarin . 
The doctors performed two [ * * Name 5 ( PTitle ) 1 2 9 6 4 * * ] ; one looked inside your large intestine , and the other looked inside your stomach . 
The study that looked inside your stomach showed that there were some spots in your stomach lining that had eroded away , and were bleeding . 
You have been taking coumadin ( also called warfarin ) , a blood - thinning medicine that is important for you because you have mechanical heart valves . 
Coumadin helps to prevent strokes in people with these heart valves . 
But coumadin can also make it easier to bleed . 
It is likely that with too high a coumadin level , the erosions in your stomach bled more than they would have otherwise . 
You should continue to take the coumadin , and to get your blood checked regularly . 
Your doctor or nurse may need to change the dosage in order to make sure the coumadin level is correct . 
Sometimes leafy green vegetables can lower your coumadin level . 
If eating leafy green vegetables is important in your diet , talk to your doctor about trying to find ways that you can eat your vegetables and have a stable coumadin level . 
For now , avoid leafy green vegetables like kale and collard greens until you can discuss this with your doctor .

A repeat MRCP performed on [ * * 2 1 8 3 - 9 - 1 1 * * ] was normal . 
CXR , UA , blood cultures , and MRCP were unrevealing . 
Infectious disease was consulted and suggested that a drug reaction to penicillin be considered as part of the differential diagnosis , but also recommended Hep C , Hep B , RPR , and HIV as initial work up . 
These were obtained and returned negative prior to the patient ' s discharge except for the Hepatitis C serologies which are still pending . 
As the workup was in progress , the patient ' s fever curve decreased and she subsequently became afebrile 3 days prior to her discharge . 
Because the patient deffervesced , the infectious disease service did not feel that an echocardiogram , blood smears for parasites , or other serologies needed to be pursued as an inpatient . 
The service made two other recommendations : A ) a shorter follow up interval for her small lung nodule than 1 2 months due to her history of fever . 
B ) That after her acute illness subsided to consider checking crp , esr and nuclear medicine studies if all else was negative ; and to also consider checking anaplasma / ehrlichia serologies , anca , [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] , spep / upep and consider Rheumatological evaluation + / - Oncology evaluation .

No significant cord compression is noted at any level . 
Etiology for these collections could include infection or hematomas . 
Appearance is not suggestive of neoplasm , although correlation with CSF evaluation would be recommended . Evaluation is limited due to lack of contrast . 
Extensive degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with clumping of nerve roots at L 5 - S 1 . 
Given noncontrast technique , pyelonephritis cannot be excluded . 
Recommend clinical correlation . 
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function . 
Mild pulmonary hypertension . 
In presence of high clinical suspicion , absence of vegetations on transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis . 
Severe degenerative changes are identified with foraminal narrowing as above . 
The previously noted tiny epidural collection at L 5 - S 1 level is not apparent but mild epidural enhancement is seen . 
No definite new collection is identified . 
Note that MRI or radionuclide bone scan are more sensitive for the detection of early infection . 
The electrophysiologic findings are consistent with a severe , subacute multilevel polyradiculopathy involving cervical and lumbosacral myotomes diffusely and would be consistent with either an inflammatory / infectious meningeal process . 
The abnormalities are most pronounced in the midcervical region . 
In addition , there is evidence for a superimposed neuromyopathy , as may be seen in acute quadriplegic myopathy of intensive care . 
There is an interbody anterior graft at C 5 - 6 and apparently C 7 body has been partially replaced by a metallic device . 
No acute infarction or hemorrhage . 
Sinus disease as described above , the activity of which is to be determined clinically . 
Enhancing fluid within the left temporalis region suggestive of phlegmon . 
This enhancing collection previously demonstrated restricted diffusion . 
Additional subcutaneous scalp fluid collections in the bilateral parietal regions may represent soft tissue edema ; however , there is no evidence of enhancement to suggest abscess . 
New posterior epidural abscess extending from the level of L 4 - L 5 to the level of S 2 with phlegmonous extension into the paravertebral and paraspinous musculature . 
No evidence of enhancing intervertebral discs to suggest discitis . 
Advanced degenerative changes of the lumbar spine , unchanged since the previous examination . 
No evidence of abnormal signal within the thoracic spinal cord . 
Epidural abscess is again demonstrated at the level of T 7 / T 8 , causing anterior thecal sac deformity and also demonstrating pattern of enhancement . 
Heterogeneous signal is again redemonstrated in the bone marrow , likely consistent with a combination of osteomyelitis / discitis . 
Persistent bilateral pleural effusions . 
These demonstrate the lower lumbar spine . 
At the lumbosacral junction , instrumentation is demonstrated . 
Background degenerative change is demonstrated in the remainder of the lumbar spine in the single intraoperative radiograph . 
For full details of surgery , please consult the operative report . 
Persistent multiloculated small epidural abscess anterior to the thecal sac at the L 5 - S 1 level measuring up to 2 cm in the SI dimension and compressimg the thecal sac at this level . 
Markedly improved epidural abscesses at C 5 through T 1 , T 3 - T 4 and posteriorly at L 4 - L 5 . 
Fluid collections in the resection bed within the cervical and lumbar spine may be postoperative , though infection cannot be excluded . 
Persistent multifocal abnormal bone marrow signal abnormality , consistent with extensive osteomyelitis . 
Large bilateral pleural effusions . 
Fibrin sheath identified around PICC line in the right basilic vein . 
The fibrin sheath does not extend beyond the basilic vein . 
No deep venous thrombosis identified in right upper limb . 
Normal compressibility , flow , waveform , and augmentation demonstrated . 
No intraluminal thrombus is identified . 
Subcutaneous edema is noted bilaterally . 
IMPRESSION : No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis bilaterally . 
Brief Hospital Course : # . 
MSSA infection ( including epidural abscesses / vertebral osteo / meningitis / bacteremia / skin lesions / UTI ) : Pt found to have MSSA from blood and also grew MSSA from urine . 
Vancomycin was started , then switched to Nafcillin when the organism was identified . 
TTE was performed and showed no vegetations . 
It is unknown what the portal of entry for the MSSA was . 
The bacteremia , skin lesions and UTI resolved with appropriate antibiotic therapy . 
Ortho spine was consulted and recommended serial imaging to determine whether epidural abscesses were increasing in size or causing spinal cord compression . 
Pt got MRIs approximately once a week and on the 3 rd it was more clear that the patient would require surgery . 
She underwent neurosurgery [ * * 1 0 - 3 0 * * ] and for epidural abscess drainage ( and C 7 corpectomy , C 4 - T 1 fusion , T 3 - 4 laminectomy ) . 
Multiple abscesses present ( ~ 5 , with 3 major ones ) , hardware place , cultures sent , debrided . 
Upon repeat imaging post operatively , MRI showed expanding T - spine epidural abscess , so she then underwent L spine decompression [ * * 1 1 - 2 * * ] with debridement . 
Per ID , Gentamycin was added to help with Nafcillin penetration for a 5 - day course , which was completed on [ * * 1 1 - 6 * * ] . 
Pt will continue on nafcillin for at least 8 weeks and will follow up with spine and ID . 
Her tentative stop date for nafcillin is [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] , or it may be stopped on [ * * 1 2 - 1 4 * * ] when she visits ID . 
She has an appointment with Spinal surgery on [ * * 2 1 8 6 - 1 2 - 2 7 * * ] . 
She is to have weekly [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] draws faxed to the Infectious Disease Physician , [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
Her nafcillin was stopped during this treatment and was restarted on [ * * 1 1 - 1 9 * * ] . 
Altered mental status : The patient was initially minimally responsive . 
This was thought to be secondary to meningitis as well as the severity of her infection . 
This resolved substantially with antibiotics . 
She did remain minimally delerious throughout her stay ( generally oriented x 3 with moments of confusion ) . 
MRI head was normal . 
Neurology was consulted who felt that some of the weakness could be [ * * 1 2 - 2 5 * * ] cord inflammation and so pt recieved pulsed steroids early in her admission without significant effect . 
Pt underwent EMG which showed a mixed picture ( see EMG report for full details ) . 
Pt did undergo decompression on [ * * 1 0 - 3 0 * * ] and [ * * 1 1 - 2 * * ] but strength remained similar . 
IV PPI was continued and she recieved 1 U of prbcs and had an EGD which showed severe ulcerations in stomach and duodenum most consistent with nsaid use ( pt did use ibuprofen at home ) . 
Per pt she had had a normal colonoscopy at [ * * Hospital 1 1 1 2 * * ] 4 yrs ago and this was not repeated as an inpt . 
Pt also reports h / o duodenal ulcers in the [ * * 2 1 4 7 * * ] . 
An h pylori was sent and was positive . 
Treatment of h pylori was deferred in setting of nafcillin therapy and severe infection . 
She should continue lansoprazole until her visit with the Gastroenterologist in [ * * Month ( only ) 4 0 4 * * ] . 
Persistent Sinus Tachycardia : Pt maintained HR of ~ 1 0 0 throughout her admission ( ~ 1 month ) . 
This was felt to most likely be related to her severe underlying infection and recurrent low grade fevers . 
Intravascular volume depletion was also a likely contributor given pt ' s low albumin and anasarca and clinical appearance of being dry ( dry mouth , low JVP ) . 
PE was considered , however , pt was on DVT ppx throughout admission and EKG did not have any changes . 
Further , pt ' s oxygen requirement was minimal to none and ultimately it was decided that PE was highly unlikely . 
Also given her prolonged stay may be a PE , though this is less likely . 
Edema : Patient was noted to have anasarca and an albumin of 1 . 9 . 
Pt was not diuresed aggressively as she appeared intravascularly depleted and had minimal oxygen requirement . 
Her edema improved upon discharge . 
Anemia : Pt remained anemic throughout her stay . 
Perhaps she has had ulcers for some time contributing to her anemia . 
Her reticulocyte count was 6 . 7 arguing against marrow suppression as the etiology , however , iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease . 
The transfusion goal was set at 2 2 . 
She recieved 2 U of PRBCs throughout her stay . 
Pain : Patient had severe back pain throughout her admission that was ultimately treated with a fentanyl patch with small boluses of IV morphine for breakthrough pain . 
A kanair bed was also found to help with her pain . 
Rash : On admission pt had 2 rashes . 
She had diffuse small pustules which grew MSSA and resolved c antibiotics . 
She also had , on the left back , a 4 x 3 cm erythematous plaque with a central brown / black , rough , necrotic area which was biopsied by dermatology and showed " Focal necrotizing vasculitis in mid - dermis with focal thrombosis , and ischemic necrosis of epidermis and appendages " which dermatology felt was consistent with a reactive process , rather than representing a primary vasculitis , given the clinical scenerio . 
Acute renal failure : Pt had [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] on admission , which resolved c IVF . 
Elevated transaminases : Pt had elevated LFTs on admission , most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS . 
RUQ ultrasound unremarkable . 
This was trended and resolved . 
Thrombocytopenia : in combination with direct bilirubinemia was concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC on admission , however no chistocytes on smear . 
Most likely due to poor production in the setting of infection and resolved during admission . 
Nutrition : she failed speech and swallow on [ * * 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] . 
A percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube was placed on [ * * 1 1 - 1 5 * * ] and tube feeds continued . 
Standing electrolyte orders were instilled and should be continued in rehab until levels normalize . 
Also , a Chem - 1 0 should be checked every other day while taking these medications . 
Access : Patient has a PICC placed in the right arm on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 1 0 - 1 9 * * ] .

Discharge Instructions : You were admitted with a bacterial infection of your spinal fluid and the bones of your spine as well as your urine and blood and skin . 
You were treated with antibiotics and the orthopedic surgeons did two surgeries to take out the abscesses . 
You also had a lot of weakness , for which we had neurology see you . 
They felt that your weakness was due to a combination of factors including the infection around your spine and also some muscle weakness from being so weak . 
You worked extensively with physical therapy and will continue to do so at rehab . 
You were having difficulty swallowing as well , thought secondary to pharyngeal inflammation from your cervical spine surgery and muscle weakness from prolonged hospitalization .

He denied fevers , chills , chest pain , abdominal pain . 
Emesis x 1 that AM . 
In ED he was found to be hypoxemic w / sats 8 5 % on RA , pulmonary edema on CXR and SBP in the 8 0 ' s . 
On presentation , however , the patient was alert and oriented , appropriate and mentating well . 
He initially received 2 L NS for IVF hydration , as well as antibiotics including ceftriaxone , azithromycin , vancomycin for suspected community acquired pneumonia . 
The patient then went into rapid afib with HR in the 1 4 0 ' s . 
He was given 5 mg Lopressor IV and his HR decreased to 1 0 0 . 
However , the patient ' s respiratory status declined precipitously and his sats dipped to 8 6 % on a 1 0 0 % face mask . 
He was placed on a nonrebreather and subsequently intubated in the setting of impending respiratory failure . 
Peri - intubation the patient again became hypotensive with SBP in the 8 0 - 6 0 ' s and was started on dopamine and dilt for rate control . 
After intubation and central line placement , the patient was transferred to the MICU and admitted with a running diagnosis of sepsis caused by an underlying community acquired pneumonia . 
Although the patient had a extensive medical history and problem list , prior to presentation and subsequent admission to the hospital he was fairly independent and ambulatory , living at home with his wife .

Mild to moderate ( [ * * 1 2 - 1 1 * * ] + ) aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened . 
There is moderate / severe mitral valve prolapse . 
There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail . 
There is a echodense mass on the posterior leaflet consistent with probable old vegetation on the mitral valve ; small mobile echodense mass is associated that may represent a possible new vegetation . 
Eccentric , anteriorly directed , moderate to severe ( 3 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
No vegetation / mass is seen on the tricuspid or pulmonic valves .

Mild to moderate ( 2 + ) aortic regurgitation . 
Mild to moderate ( 2 + ) tricuspid regurgitation . 
Normal biventricular systolic function ( LVEF 6 0 - 7 0 % ) ( intrinisic LV systolic function may be depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation ) . 
ECHO Study Date of [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] Conclusions : Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen . 
There is partial mitral leaflet flail . 
Moderate to severe ( 3 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen .

The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
There is partial mitral leaflet flail . 
Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified . 
Compared with the findings of the prior study ( tape reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] , the mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet is more prominent . 
This may represent a flailed mitral valve leaflet with chordae or it may represent a vegetation . 
If the mass is a vegetation , and because this mass appears calcified , this mass might be a healed vegetation . 
The mitral regurgitation is hard to quantify in this present study . 
TEE ECHO Study Date of [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 3 * * ] Conclusions : The left atrium is markedly dilated . 
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium / left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium / right atrial appendage .

Mild ( 1 + ) aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened . 
There is partial flail of the posterior leaflet with leaflet tethering and a very small ( ~ 2 mm ) mobile echodensity at the leaflet tip that likely represents a ruptured chordae ( cannot exclude a vegetation if clinically suggested ) . . An eccentric jet of severe ( 4 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
An echodense " mass " is seen in close proximity to the mitral annulus . 
This may represent a healed abscess or atypical mitral annular calcification . 
A mobile mass is seen attached to the posterior leaflet . 
This may represent a torn chordae or a healed vegetation . 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
No vegetation / mass is seen on the pulmonic valve or tricuspid valve . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
There is bibasilar atelectasis as well . 
A pneumonia in these consolidative areas cannot be fully excluded . 
The previously noted bilateral upper lobe air space disease has progressed and appears more densely consolidated , particularly within the right upper lobe , and to a lesser extent the left upper lobe . 
Additionally , Hounsfield units within the areas of dense consolidation measure up to approximately 6 7 Hounsfield units , which is denser than simple fluid , indicating complex fluid , possibly hemorrhage .

The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
Mild ( 1 + ) aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened .

Brief Hospital Course : The patient was admitted to the MICU with a diagnosis of sepsis and community acquired pneumonia . 
He had a long and complicated hospital course that will be described by system . 
Respiratory : The patient was intubated on the day of admission for hypoxic respiratory failure presumably related to sepsis and CAP in the setting of baseline CHF . 
In the ED , the patient received a dose of ceftriaxone , azithromycin , and vancomycin . 
He was initially continued on Vancomycin and also started on Levaquin for ABx coverage for presumed community acquired pneumonia . 
Blood cultures drawn on the date of admission [ * * 1 0 - 4 * * ] showed 1 / 2 bottles positive for Staph Coag Neg . 
Further blood cultures were negative . 
He then developed ventilator associated pneumonia with MRSA . 
He was given Linezolid for coverage of MRSA and completed a 2 - week course on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 2 5 * * ] . 
He required trach placement on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 2 5 * * ] for failure to wean . 
His sputum cultures were repeatedly positive for MRSA and pseudomonas and enterobacter cloacea througout his hospitalization . 
He was treated with vancomycin and meropenem from [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 3 1 * * ] through [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 1 3 * * ] . 
The vancomycin was restarted on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 1 5 * * ] after he spiked a fever and had MRSA in sputum again and this was continued until his discharge . 
He was started on ceftazidime on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 2 3 * * ] and that was also continued until his discharge . 
He was also treated with Flagyl early in the hospitalization for presumed aspiration pneumonia . 
Most recent sputum cultures from [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 2 9 * * ] were positive for MRSA and pseudomonas sensitive to ceftazidime . 
His latest ventilator settings were AC / 0 . 4 / TV = 6 0 0 / RR = 1 0 / PEEP = 5 . 
He had repeated trials with a Passy - Miur valve that were unsuccessful leading to coughing fits . 
CV : The patient was initially hypotensive at the time of admission , likely related to sepsis + / - possible adrenal insufficiency . 
On admission , he was started on stress dose steroids and overnight remained on dopamine . 
The patient was able to be weaned off pressors after the first night , but subsquently required intermitent use of pressors to maintain his SBP . 
Rhythm : He was in afib with a rapid ventricular response on admisison that was treated with a diltiazem drip , lopressor and digoxin . 
He developed polymorphic VT with a transition to Vfib on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] that responded to defibrillation . 
He was started on a lidocaine drip and then switched to amiodarone . 
The amiodarone dose was decreased on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 2 8 * * ] in attempt to decrease the beta blocker effect in the face of CHF . 
He is to remain on Amiodarone 2 0 0 mg PO daily . 
He also went into atrial fibrillation early in the hospital course that resolved with discontinuation of dobutamine . 
He was in normal sinus rhythm at the time of discharge . 
Mitral Regurgitation : Per echo he has 4 + MR , which has been refractory to medical therapy . 
Fluid overload was a major issue . 
He underwent ultrafiltation in the CCU for several days with removal of 1 8 L of fluid . 
Upon completion of ultrafiltration he was diuresed unsuccessfully with lasix boluses . 
He was started on a lasix drip with a goal of even to negative fluid balance . 
However , we were limited given his hypotension and had to be held frequently . 
His blood pressure also did not tolerate nesiritide . 
Captopril was added at a dose of 1 2 . 5 mg TID for afterload reduction , along with Lasix drip as tolerated by BP . 
Digoxin was also added for inotropic effect . 
Close to discharge , the patient was tolerating captopril plus intermittent lasix drip of 2 mg / hr titrated to blood pressure . 
The lasix drip was converted to a standing dose of 4 0 mg IV BID . 
Metolazone 5 mg po BID was also added for synergy . 
Pt did well on this regimen x 4 8 hrs prior to the time of discharge . 
Pt was initially informed that he may be candidate for MV replacement surgery , but was subsequently refused this surgery by the CT [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] service who felt that his operative risk was too high given his significant comorbities . 
Subsequently , low suspicion . 
Agitation : Pt was kept on a standing dose of haldol 2 . 5 mg TID which was effective . 
Nutrition : Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] has a PEG tube and was tolerating tube feeds using Respalor Full strength at 5 0 cc / hr . 
Vit C and Zinc were added per nutrition recommendations . 
Endocrine : Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] has known panhypopituitarism . 
He was admitted on prednisone 5 mg daily ( home dose ) . 
He required stress dose steroids for his adrenal , subsequently tapered to 2 0 mg PO daily , on which he remains at the time of discharge . 
Regarding his diabetes , serum glucose was well controlled on an insulin sliding scale starting with 5 units for FSG > 1 5 0 and incrementing by 2 units . 
Hematology : He had thrombocytopenia initially on admission . 
HIT antibody was negative . 
His thrombocytopenia was subsequently attributed to Linezolid , and resolved several days after linezolid was discontinued . 
Platelet count 1 7 0 s on day of discharge . 
Prophylaxis : Pt was treated with Carafate for GI prophylaxis ( given thrombocytopenia ) and Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis . 
Physical Therapy : Pt was felt to be progressing well from a PT standpoint . 
He will need continued aggressive PT follow - up . 
Access : A right subclavian was placed on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 1 4 * * ] and a PICC line was placed on [ * * 2 1 6 2 - 1 1 - 3 0 * * ] .

Her hospital course was complicated by Mental Status changes which after ICE therapy necessitating an admission to the ICU without any acute evidence of an intracranial process . 
Her hospital course at this time was also complicated by persistent ATLL , hypercalcemia , renal tubular acidosis , acute renal failure , C . Diff colitis , and CMV viremia . 
Subsequently she developed hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to invasive aspergillosis with pulmonary hemorrhage . 
She underwent a pulmonary embolization procedure and a second intubation and ICU stay . 
Upon returning to the floor , no additional therapeutic intervention was started for her ATLL . 
Her mental status continued to deteroirate , and she stopped taking PO . 
Due to disease progression in addition to a persistent fungal infection and concern for aspiration goals of care were discussed with her family .

According to her family she was in her usual state of health until about a week ago when she started having difficulty with word finding , short term memory , using household items , and was walking slowly . 
They also state that she seemed slightly unsteady while walking but has had no other abnormal movements . 
Of note , she was prescribed TMP / SMX on [ * * 7 - 3 0 * * ] for nasal cellulitis . 
Her son , a nurse , suspected lithium toxicity and called her PCP who referred them to the ED . 
She was found to have a Cr of 1 . 3 from a baseline of 0 . 7 and a lithium level of 2 . 0 . 
Glucose was 2 1 5 ( she has had episodes of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic episodes in the past ) . 
Toxicology was consulted , recommending dialysis due to her symptoms . 
Nephrology recommended aggressive hydration first , and regardless , the patient refused to have dialysis or Foley catheters placed . 
She received 3 L NS in the ED with marked improvements in her symptoms , although she did not return to baseline . 
She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring and aggressive diuresis . 
Upon arrival , her vitals were T 3 6 . 4 , HR 6 6 , BP 1 5 4 / 6 9 , RR 1 9 , Sat 9 9 % RA . 
She was comfortable and in NAD . 
She had no fevers , chills , chest pain , dyspnea , nausea , vomiting , dysuria , urinary frequency , or extremity pain . 
Lives at home with husband . 
Family History : Strokes in mother and father . 
Renal disease and MI in brother . 
No evidence of infection on UA , no fever or leukocytosis . 
She has a history of AMS with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states , but her hyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity was normal . 
Toxicology initially recommended dialysis , but nephrology recommended trying aggressive diuresis before dialyzing the patient , who said that she would refuse a dialysis catheter . 
Lithium was held , [ * * Known lastname * * ] was held and she was hydrated agressively with LR , since patient has received 6 L NS and developed a hyperchloremic acidosis . 
This was thought to be most likely intrinsic from TMP / SMX usage , but there she may have had prerenal physiology as well due to decreased PO intake . 
There was no evidence of obstruction or infection . 
She was kept on her sliding scale insulin , metformin was held . 
Continued home levothyroxine . 
She has no mood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at all consistent with mania or depression . 
We continued her home benzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acute toxicity . 
No evidence of acute bleeding . 
Stool Guiac was negative and serial crits were stable . 
Transitional Issues : - She was told to hold her [ * * Location * * ] . 
Restarting should be decided by outpatient physician [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) * * ] [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) * * ] may have increased her Lithium level in setting of [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] . 
Again , she was instructed to follow up with her outpatient PCP regarding [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] use . 
Take fasting with water only . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid ( walker or cane ) . 
You were admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] with Lithium toxicity and Acute Kidney Injury . 
It is believed that because of your nasal cellulitis you became dehydrated which affected your kidneys ability to clear Lithium . 
The [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] antibiotic you took for cellulitis may have also caused some kidney injury which may have increased your Lithium level as well . 
Dehydration , kidney injury and increasing Lithium levels in your blood caused your altered mental status , difficulty finding words and unsteady walking . 
You were treated with aggressive hydration and stopping Lithium . 
You were observed and as your Lithium levels fell to normal range you became more alert and mentally clear . 
You are being discharged in stable condition with a normal Lithium level . 
The following changes to your medications were made : - You can begin taking your Lithium again tomorrow [ * * 8 - 6 * * ] at your regular home dose - You should avoid taking [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) * * ] again in the future because it may have increased Lithium levels on your body - Please do not take your [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 2 1 1 7 7 * * ] until you see your outpatient physician . 
You will be reconnected with your primary care physician after this visit .

Over the past 6 weeks he has been only taking liquids to stay hydrated , no solid food , and has lost at least 1 5 lbs as a result . 
He has a very mild shortness of breath but in general aside from " not wanting to eat " denies anything else that is bothering him at present . 
He has visited his PCP several times and was finally referred for admission to [ * * Hospital * * ] Hospital due to failure to thrive . 
He had a CT today which shows a large left diaphragmatic hernia with abdominal contents in the left chest , with organo - axial volvulus . 
He received zosyn and Protonix 4 0 at [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and was transferred here for further management of this complex surgical problem . 
The heart shadow is difficult to delineate in detail because of overlapping mediastinal structures including a large left - sided hiatal hernia . 
Significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested . 
Relative prominence of the central pulmonary vessels is identified but more attenuated appearance of the periphery does not demonstrate any evidence of advanced CHF . 
There are some old parenchymal scars in the apical area but no active abnormalities are seen . 
Bilaterally , the lateral pleural spaces are blunted probably by pleural effusions mild - to - moderate degree . 
There is a large sized hiatal hernia with typical air - fluid level in retrocardiac position . 
No other pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities can be identified . 
Our records do not include previous chest examinations available for comparison . 
An outside chest CT has been transferred in to our PACS system and shows the presence of a large hiatal hernia . 
Based on his symptoms and anatomy , repair of his large paraesophageal hernia was recommended . 
Unfortunately he became delirious after having low dose Ativan which was given preoperatively to reduce his anxiety . 
He was taken to the Operating Room for surgery on [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 1 5 * * ] but immediately refused the surgery when he arrived in the Operating Room . 
He appeared confused and delirious , the surgery was cancelled and he returned to the floor . 
The Psychiatry service evaluated him and felt that the confusion and delirium was prompted by Ativan in combination with poor nutritional status and his age . 
At that point the patient wanted surgery again . 
A decision was made to place a PICC line and give TPN for 4 - 5 days prior to operating with the attempt to help improve his nutritional status . 
A PICC line was placed on [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 1 6 * * ] and TPN began . 
In the mean time he worked with Physical Therapy and had no more episodes of confusion or delirium . 
On [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 2 0 * * ] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with PEG tube placement . 
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition . 
He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled . 
Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make good progress . 
His pain was controlled with Tylenol alone and his mental status was intact . 
His TPN continued and eventually tube feedings were started and well tolerated . 
He was maintained on 2 cal HN 1 can TID . 
His TPN was weaned off [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 2 3 * * ] and his PICC line was removed . 
His chest xray on admission to the hospital was notable for bilateral pleural effusions but his respiratory status was not compromised . 
His effusions did increase in size and on [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 2 3 * * ] he has a left thoracentesis for 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid . 
He tolerated it well and his subsequent chest xray demonstrated no pneumothorax and a clear diaphram . 
He was breathing comfortably off of oxygen and had room air saturations of 9 5 % . 
He continued to work with Physical Therapy who recommended that he go to a short term rehab prior to returning home to increase his mobility and endurance . 
From a surgical standpoint he continued to do well . 
His post sites were healing well and his PEG site was dry . 
After a long hospital stay he was discharged to rehab on [ * * 2 1 3 0 - 3 - 2 4 * * ] .

I have not seen him since November . 
About three weeks ago he stopped his Prednisone on his own because he was gaining weight . 
He does feel that his shoulders are definitely improved . 
It is unclear what he is actually taking , but I think based on the color of his pills and the timing of the medication that he continues taking his Atenolol for hypertension and 1 Hydroxychloroquine tablet . 
He is concerned because of the relatively recent onset of difficulties turning his head to the right . 
When he does this , he will note that he feels as though he is going to pass out although this has not actually happened . 
This only occurs when he turns to the right and not to the left . 
He has no visual changes otherwise and denies any headache or other cranial complaints . 
On examination today , BP 1 2 0 / 8 0 . 
He has no bruits over the carotid . 
He has no tenderness in this region either . 
He has good peripheral pulses at the arms . 
His joint examination is much improved with better ROM of the shoulders and no peripheral joint synovitis . 
He has stopped the Prednisone , and I would not restart it yet . 
Will arrange for carotid ultrasound studies . 
Patient advised to call me if he develops any worsening symptoms . 
He has been taking 1 aspirin per day prophylaxis long - term , and I stressed that he continue to do so . 
He will follow - up with me shortly after the ultrasound study .

Pt has had increasing CP and SOB on exertion for past two months , seen at PCP on 2 / 0 3 with EKG showing RBBB . 
Pt was scheduled for stress MIBI today to eval for cardiac ischemia . 
MIBI was reportedly stopped 2 / 2 to chest pain , though pt denies having pain during procedure . 
MIBI was read as positive for moderate to severe inferior ischemia and pt was referred to the ED for admission and catheterization . 
No focal weakness or paresthesias . 
The ECG is positive for ischemia . 
LV contractile function is normal . 
Findings are consistent with moderate to severe ischemia in the inferior and inferolateral ischemia at low work load ( 1 . 5 min EX ) .

No variation with food . 
No change with position ( e . g . , leaning forward ) . 
Denies productive cough , fever , chills , nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations .

IVCD ( toward RBBB , but does not meet criteria ) ; inverted Ts in II , III , AVF . 
Compared with 8 / 7 9 - - the QRS complex is slightly narrower . 
Sx are different from his original anginal pain - - and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the sternotomy site . 
No sign , currently , of local or systemic infection . 
Doubt pneumonia ( no cough or fever , lungs clear ) or GI cause . 
Pericarditis a possibility ( he had post - op pericarditis after his CABG ) , but no signs on ECG , and the pain is not positional . 
The patient is intubated and non communicative at the time of initial exam . 
Her daughter and health care proxy is able to relay the events from the time of the patients fall at 4 3 0 pm [ * * 4 - 2 * * ] . 
Her daughter reports that she was in another room when her mother fell .

Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage . 
Inferolateral ST - T wave changes with ST segment depressions may be due to ischemia , etc . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 6 9 - 4 - 2 * * ] precordial voltage is more prominent . 
ST - T wave changes are more apparent . 
Clinical correlation is suggested .

No evidence of larger pleural effusions . 
Brief Hospital Course : Patient was admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] after transfer from OSH with significantly sized intracranial hemorrhage while on anticoagulation therapy from previous cardiac surgery . 
Upon admission ; she was administered platelets and admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring . 
On [ * * 4 - 3 * * ] , repeat head CT was performed and determined to be stable , and not indicitative of ongoing hemorrhage . 
She was subsequently extubated . 
On [ * * 4 - 4 * * ] , she was observed to have difficulty managing her secretions , and an arterial blood gas was performed and revealed a PaO 2 in the 5 0 s , and was reintubated . 
Head CT was again performed to evaluate whether the ICH had evolved to attribute to the poor respiratory effort , but was stable . 
On [ * * 4 - 5 * * ] , a bedside mini bronchoscopy was done to evaluate if she had aspirated any secretions during her period of poor respiratory effort . 
A lung consolidation was identified , and antibiotics were started . 
On [ * * 4 - 5 * * ] her exam was stable and social work was consulted for family regarding the possibility for trach / peg & DNR / I status . 
On [ * * 4 - 6 * * ] her sodium was 1 5 3 , mannitol was stopped , free H 2 O was increased to 1 5 0 cc QID , and her exam was stable . 
On [ * * 4 - 7 * * ] she had a troponin leak 1 . 1 9 and a family meeting w / palliative care where the conclusion was to make her CMO and she was eventually extubated and started on morphine for comfort . 
On [ * * 4 - 8 * * ] she passed away . 
He reports being in his normal state of health until 4 days ago , when he noticed slight stomach ache , then had maroon bowel movements , [ * * 4 - 1 3 * * ] daily .

Three days prior to admission , the patient was awakened from sleep short of breath , diaphoretic , and with 3 / 1 0 chest pressure radiating to both shoulders . 
These symptoms resolved upon sitting up . 
Similar episodes ocurred more frequently over the next few days , and the patient decided to seek medical attention . 
He denies nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , lower extremity edema , increased abdominal girth . 
He has been sleeping with 2 pillows , which is unchanged . 
At baseline , the patient is able to walk without shortness of breath or chest pressure .

Family History : Several family members on both sides of the family have significant vascular disease . 
Two brothers with extensive history of MI and PVD . 
CNII - XII are intact , and patient with 5 / 5 strength throughout , normal sensation throughout . 
No pronator drift . 
His cardiac catherization demonstrated a right dominant system with 8 0 % stenosis of the LMCA distally , bilateral 6 0 % renal artery re - stenoses along with a diffuse 4 0 % occlusion of his left subclavian resulting in 5 0 mmHg drop in his peripheral blood pressures compared to his central blood pressure . 
He also had an elevated PCWP of 3 5 mm Hg . 
He was thus admitted to the CCU for agressive blood pressure management and diuresis with lasix and niseritide . 
On return to the floor , the patient continued to have poorly controlled hypertension and recurrent congestive heart failure exacerbations . 
Lasix and niseritide were employed again with good effect . 
After several family meetings to explain the [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] medical status to both the patient himself and his family , the patient agreed to accept home oxygen supplementation in light of his tenous fluid status . 
He will be followed by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] in 2 weeks to discuss renal MRA and possible vascular intervention because it was not possible to accurately assess the patient ' s renal arteries with ultrasound . 
The patient was discharged on maximal doses of blood pressure medications with the exception of starting an ace - inhibitor or [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] in light of his poor renal function secondary to renal artery stenosis . 
The patient ' s underlying etiology of hypertension is unclear but likely related to renal artery stenosis . 
This issue will be addressed as an outpatient with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] and Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 1 4 9 6 6 * * ] , the patient ' s cardiologists . 
Cardiac catheterization revealed severely elevated left and right sided filling pressures which were indicative of the congestive heart failure described above . 
There was no evidence of GI bleeding at this hospital . 
Further analysis of the patient ' s Hct over the last few years reveals a chronic anemia . 
The patient was transfused a total of 4 units while in the unit and just prior to discharge . 
In the long term , it may be considered to send the patient for colonoscopy or endoscopy to evaluate for GI pathology that could account for chronic slow bleeding . 
With respect to etiology of the patient ' s chronic anemia , iron studies are pending at the time of this discharge summary . 
With aggressive diuresis , the patient ' s dye nephropathy resolved and creatinine returned to his baseline of 1 . 6 prior to discharge . 
The patient did not require hemodialysis . 
This status was confirmed with the patient , his son , and his daughter .

He underwent diuresis and was started on levo / flagyl for ? LLL PNA , started [ * * 3 - 3 1 * * ] . 
On [ * * 4 - 3 * * ] , levo / flagyl d / c ' d as all cx negative , pt afebrile . 
Another reason abx d / c ' d was b / c pt developed a rash thought to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction , which improved post d / c abx . 
ID was consulted [ * * 4 - 4 * * ] for continued fevers and recommended the initiation of broad spectrum abx incl . 
Vancomycin , Aztreonam , and Flagyl ( stopped [ * * 4 - 8 * * ] ) , RUQ US to r / o cholangitis ( b / c pt had elev LFTs ) , and stated would not give steroids , and would do bronchoscopy / BAL for most likely pulm source . 
Chest CT demonstrated b / l lower lobe infiltrates c / w pulm edema vs . PNA . 
Pt underwent Bronch [ * * 4 - 5 * * ] , showing limited eval of right sided airways , lavage with RLL post segment , result : no PMN , no microorg , grew OP flora , PCP negative , AFB negative . 
He has been on Vanco for 8 days . 
The pt ' s LFT elevation was attributed to IL - 2 therapy , a known side effect . 
Also , he was noted to have renal insufficiency , with Cr to 1 . 6 , and eosinophilia , with presumed AIN . 
His creatinine continued to rise to 2 . 6 ( baseline 0 . 9 ) . 
He was given prednisone , which was subsequently d / c ' d . 
Renal was consulted [ * * 2 1 7 0 - 4 - 5 * * ] and recommended for pt to increase free water intake . 
They felt he had a number of reasons to have ARF , including : capillary leak syndrome , NSAIDs , infection , contrast on [ * * 4 - 2 * * ] , and drug reaction though no eos or WBC in urine . 
The pt ' s creatinine demonstrated slow improvement , was 1 . 4 [ * * 4 - 7 * * ] , and on transfer from ICU , his Cr was 0 . 9 ( baseline ) . 
Subjectively on transfer from [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] to the medical floor , the pt felt well , is laughing and joking with family , and has no pain complaints . 
States his breathing if fine . 
No cough , fever , chills . 
No N / V . 
No abd pain . 
No diarrhea or constipation . 
No dysuria . 
No chest pain or shortness of breath . 
Resolved ARF . 
Pulmonary status s / p respiratory distress : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 6 4 7 3 0 * * ] was intubated initially [ * * 3 - 3 1 * * ] for resp distress , thought secondary to non - cardiogenic pulm edema from capillary leak syndrome from Il - 2 , with possible contribution from PNA . 
LLL inbfiltrate on CXR , fevers , but sputum never grew anything , so unclear if PNA vs atalectasis . 
He was intially started on levaquin and flagyl . 
Chest CT showed lower lobe infiltrates c / w pulm edema vs PNA . 
Lenis were neg , but he did not have a CTA because of renal failure . 
He has no h / o CHF , COPD or asthma . 
No Echo on file . 
The pt was then taken off all abx on [ * * 4 - 1 1 * * ] because all cx data was negative and fevers seemed likely due to acute interstitial nephritis given eosinophilia , ARF , rash versus due to his melanoma and IL ' 2 treatment . 
ID was consulted , recommended bronchoscopy and labs , empiric sntibiotics for presumed Hospital acquired PNA vs . line infection , so he was started on vancomycin . 
Bronchoscopy from [ * * 4 - 5 * * ] was negative . 
He remained on vancomycin for 8 days until his central line was pulled . 
We then discontinued Vancomycin IV . 
However , eos negative in urine . 
Renal consulted felt to be pre - renal also question contrast induced nephropathy . 
This fully resolved with hydration , so finally appeared to be most likely pre - renal and contrast related . 
His creatinine continued to be at his baseline . 
We ended up restarting his outpatient ACEI . 
Will see PCP [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] 1 week . 
He has been hemodynamically stable . 
ID was consulted in the setting of contemplating starting steroids . 
ID recomended to r / o infection BAL prior to starting empiric antibiotics , multiples serologies histoplasma antigen , EBV viral load , CMV viral load , cryptococal antigen , Strongiloides serology . 
RUQ u / s . 
All work up unrevealing to date , and fevers tapered off . 
Afebrile for 6 days prior to leaving ICU . 
Initial empiric a / b regimen with flagyl , aztreonam and vanco was D / C ' d . 
He has remained afebrile on the medical floor and has been instructed to report to the ED for fever , chills . 
Hypernatremia , resolved : Likely due to increase insensible lossess . 
Free water boluses and D 5 w was given with normalization of sodium . 
Other sources excluded , so IV vamco empirically given . 
His line was pulled , no drainage and erythema at site .

With evidence suggestive of prior TB , current active TB infection is not excluded . 
CT CHEST [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 7 - 2 8 * * ] IMPRESSIONS : 1 . 
Peribronchovascular opacities in the right upper and middle lobes most suggestive of bronchopneumonia . 
Given history of TB and a partly calcified mass in the right upper lobe which could represent a large granuloma , active tuberculosis is an important differential consideration . 
Hemorrhage is another consideration . 
Calcified nodule in the right lung ( 2 0 x 1 0 mm ) , probably sequela of prior infection versus a tumor . 
CT follow - up is recommended to resolution of opacities and surveillance of the lung nodule within three months . 
If available , comparison to prior studies could also be helpful . 
PET scanning could also be considered once the more acute process has resolved . 
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN . 
OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA . 
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD ( S ) . 
STAPH AUREUS COAG + . 
Bacterial culture results are invalid . 
PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN . 
Given the patient ' s prior history of TB and the inability to exclude this on presentation , he was admitted to a negative - pressure room . 
On the floor , he remained hemodynamically stable . 
He had three negative AFBs and was removed from respiratory precautions . 
He had a CT scan on [ * * 7 - 2 8 * * ] which showed peribronchovascular opacities and a 1 cm x 2 cm right lung nodule felt to be chronic granuloma / prior infection sequelae vs . malignancy . 
On [ * * 7 - 2 9 * * ] , he again had moderate hemoptysis and reportedly vomited blood and had black stools . 
Pulmonary was consulted , and he was started on Ceftriaxone / Azithromycin empirically for CAP on [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 7 - 3 1 * * ] . 
Durnig his course , he had a recurrence of massive hemoptysis . 
He was bronched on [ * * 8 - 1 * * ] and found to have substantial bleeding from the posterior segment of right upper lobe . 
He then went to IR and had embolization of the right bronchial artery and right upper intercostal arterial branch . 
After the procedure , he was intubated with a dual - lumen endotracheal tube to prevent extravasation of blood into the left lung if bleeding recurred . 
He remained stable and was extubated on [ * * 8 - 2 * * ] . 
Ceftriaxone was replaced with Cefpodoxime on [ * * 8 - 3 * * ] . 
His pulmonary hemorrhage was attributed to inflammation of prior eroded tissue from old TB , with a new pneumonia as the precipitant . 
The patient was transferred to the medical floor on [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 8 - 3 * * ] , and his creatinine normalized with IV fluids and time . 
He demonstrated continued clinical improvement , with small amount of hemoptysis post - procedure . 
He remained afebrile with normal vital signs after transfer from the ICU . 
He was discharged on [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 8 - 4 * * ] and will complete a 7 day course of both azithromycin and cefpodoxime , to be completed on [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 8 - 6 * * ] . 
He will schedule a follow up appointment with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] , his PCP , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) * * ] the week of discharge . 
No other medications were started . 
The patient is a full code . 
Cefpodoxime 1 0 0 mg Tablet Sig : Two ( 2 ) Tablet PO Q 1 2 H ( every 1 2 hours ) for 3 days . 
Disp : * 1 0 Tablet ( s ) * Refills : * 0 * 2 .

You were treated for a pneumonia with antiobiotics . 
Tests showed that you did not have tuberculosis again . 
You had another episode of coughing up blood while in the hospital , and you had a short stay in the intensive care unit . 
At this time , a procedure was performed to help stop the bleeding in your lungs , which was successful . 
You continued to do well after the procedure , and you were discharged on [ * * 2 1 9 3 - 8 - 4 * * ] . 
Please call Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] to set up an appointment this week . 
You should discuss with him when to have another exam of your chest . 
This exam of your chest should be within the next 3 months . 
The following changes were made to your medications : you were not taking any medications before you came to the hospital . 
Followup Instructions : Please call your PCP , [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] .

There he was intubated for airway protection in the setting of a GCS of 8 . 
CT A & P demonstrated an advanced tumor of the left lobe of the liver and abdominal varices . 
RLL consolidation consistent with PNA was also seen . 
CT Head negative for acute process . 
He was sent to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further managemnt .

Alcohol use per HPI . 
No current IV , illicit or herbal drug use . 
He is not currently sexually active . 
He is on disability . 
Recently broke up with his girlfried , which is an additoinal stressor and contributed to his increased drug and alchohol use . 
Family History : He does not know of any liver disease or colon cancer . 
The NG tube is seen traversing the gastroesophageal junction and following a course towards the stomach . 
There are bibasal effusions along with atelectasis / probable consolidation at the lung bases . 
Follow up with AP and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to assess for atelectasis vs . consolidation . 
There is apparent deformity of the left humeral head which is not well visualized and if there is suspicion of trauma to the left shoulder joint , dedicated views of the left shoulder would be helpful . 
Cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left lobe of the liver consistent with patient ' s known hepatocellular carcinoma . 
There is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein which is non - occlusive . 
Encephalopathy - The etiology of the patient ' s AMS was likely multifactorial involving end stage liver disease , ? anoxic - insult given unknown down time , and opiate toxicity . 
Head CT negative at OSH . 
Upon admission , the patient was sedated and intubated . 
Pt began regimen of lactulose with > 4 BMs per day ; with a decrease in NH 4 from 1 4 0 - - > 3 8 during his MICU stay . 
The patient ' s mentation improved during his admission , sedating medications were weaned down before extubation , and upon transfer out of MICU he was A & O to person and place and following commands . 
Pt . 
AT time of D / C he was A / Ox 3 for several days . 
Pt was intubated for unresponsiveness and a GCS of 8 at an OSH . 
CT of chest demonstrated RLL consolidation c / w possible aspiration PNA . 
Upon admission to the MICU , the patient was still intubated and sedated with propofol . 
Empiric zosyn was started for coverage of aspiration PNA which was changed to Unasyn on [ * * 1 0 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Repeat CXR on [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] showed improving lung fields with no signs of consolidation . 
Sputum GS grew GPCs in pairs , chains , and clusters on [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] . 
The pateitn was weaned off sedation on [ * * 1 0 - 1 1 * * ] , extubated , and placed on 2 LNC O 2 with adequate oxygen saturation . 
Upon transfer , the patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint . 
On the floor he did not have any pulmonary distress , but did spike a fever to 1 0 2 . 5 while on unasyn , so he was switched to vanc / levo / zosyn . 
His CXR was negative and he quickly defervesced so Abx were stopped after a short course . 
Per recent history , the patient has a h / o EtOH abuse , his HCC is rapidly progressing and his liver function is rapidly declining . 
Upon admission , he had many stigmata of liver disease , both on exam ( encephalopathic , scleral icterus , palpable mass in epigastric area c / w HCC mass in left lobe , mild ascites , spider angioma , extensive ecchymosis ) and laboratory testing ( elevated INR and abnormal liver enzymes ) . 
Pt was given vit Kx 1 without change in his INR . 
The liver team was consulted and followed the patient during his stay . 
An U / S of RUQ on [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] showed no signs of portal vein thrombosis , cirrhosis and large infiltrative mass in the left lobe of the liver c / w patient ' s known hepatocellular carcinoma ; there is probable new tumor ingrowth into the left portal vein which is non - occlusive . 
Pt . 
Hx of heavy EtOH abuse - The patient was maintained on CIWA scale with 1 mg of ativan per protocol in the MICU . 
The ativan was weaned to 0 . 5 mg on [ * * 1 0 - 1 2 * * ] and completely off two days later . 
Pt . 
Hypotension : On [ * * 1 0 - 1 1 * * ] , the patient developed hypotension to 8 0 / 4 0 ' s . 
Likely secondary to physiology of hepatic failure and possibly opioid toxicity . 
Given IVF boluses and bolus of albumin with good response . 
Home BP medications were held . 
Pt remained hemodynamically stable afterwards .

You have been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma . 
You will need to take your lactulose and Rifaximin exactly as prescribed so that you do not become confused again . 
We stopped your clonidine and nadolol because your blood pressure was low . 
We started you on a calcium supplement because your nutrition was poor . 
We increased your spironolactone to 2 0 0 mg daily and your lasix ( furosemide ) to 8 0 mg daily because your legs were swelling with fluid . 
We did not change any of your other medications . 
We started you on rifaximin to help stop you from getting confused . 
Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed . 
If you have any confusion , fevers , chills , nightsweats , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , bleeding , black tarry stools , vomiting blood or any other concerning symptoms call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency department . 
The patient has had bilateral carotid stenosis . 
On [ * * 2 - 2 1 * * ] while he was sitting in a chair he developed sudden onset of right arm and leg numbness , followed by right arm and leg weakness . 
He also had difficulty speaking . 
He was admitted to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] and underwent a left carotid endarterectomy on [ * * 2 - 2 6 * * ] and afterwards began having severe left sided headache behind his left eye that lasted for hours and was constant . 
Nevertheless , he visited [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] for continued headaches and nausea and vomiting . 
During one of those visits he had a contortion of his right face and bilateral arm jerking and was started on Dilantin with presumptive diagnosis of seizures . 
He has recovered from that event when was again discharged home . 
On [ * * 3 - 1 3 * * ] he again presented with persistent headaches , confusion and inability to talk . 
He had difficulty getting his words out . 
He had a head CT at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] which showed a linear hyperintense region in the left central temporal lobe but also other lesions in the left posterior parietal lobes . 
At that time he was transferred to the [ * * Hospital 1 6 9 * * ] . 
MRI of his head showed left MCA / ACA and left MCA / PCA watershed strokes with acute and subacute hemorrhage conversions . 
It was thought at that time that he had extended his watershed infarcts after carotid endarterectomy leading to a carotid hyperperfusion syndrome . 
The patient was discharged from the neurologic Intensive Care Unit to a rehab facility . 
On Thursday , [ * * 2 1 3 3 - 3 - 2 6 * * ] , patient ' s wife noticed erythema on patient ' s face . 
On [ * * 3 - 2 7 * * ] the visiting nurse [ * * First Name ( Titles ) 8 7 0 6 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 1 1 2 8 2 * * ] of a rash on his arms as well . 
The patient was noted to be febrile and was admitted to the [ * * Company 1 9 1 * * ] Firm . 
In the EW , patient ' s Dilantin was discontinued and he was given Tegretol instead . 
The patient works as a carpenter . 
In general , alert , oriented times three , no apparent distress . 
No lymphadenopathy . 
Cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs . 
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
Abdomen soft , nontender , non distended , positive bowel sounds . 
Extremities , no cyanosis , erythema , edema . 
Neuro , cranial nerves II through XII intact . 
Skin red maculopapular blanching erythema on face , torso and extremities , sparing the soles . 
Bilateral lower extremity petechiae , no significant oral lesions noted . 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 1 . 
The patient was initially continued on Tegretol . 
The patient had worsening rash throughout his torso with lip swelling and tongue swelling . 
The patient did not experience any respiratory difficulties throughout the course of his stay on the [ * * Company 1 9 1 * * ] service . 
A derm consult was obtained . 
The dermatology team recommended discontinuing Tegretol . 
Their thought was that the patient ' s symptoms were secondary to his hypersensitivity to Dilantin . 
The patient was treated symptomatically with IV fluids , Zantac , Benadryl and Synalar cream . 
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit overnight for observation given risk of respiratory distress . 
Skin biopsy was also consistent with hypersensitivity reaction . 
Over the course of patient ' s stay in the hospital , patient ' s rash started to improve with decreasing erythema and edema . 
They recommended stopping all anti - epileptic medications since they thought that his symptoms were likely secondary to carotid reperfusion syndrome and anti - seizure medications are not necessarily beneficial under these circumstances . 
The patient ' s Lipitor was held due to increased LFTs . 
His increased LFTs were likely secondary to Dilantin . 
Patient to follow - up with his PCP to make sure LFTs are trending down and before restarting Lipitor . 
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : 1 . 
Dilantin hypersensitivity reaction . 
Discharged to home . 
Patient ' s PCP to assess blood pressure before restarting Atenolol . 
Her course was complicated by graft versus host disease of the skin and lungs , hypertension and numerous steroid - related complications such as diabetes , steroid myopathy , and increased peripheral edema . 
She presents today from clinic with right arm swelling ( she had a PICC in the arm ) and was found to have a completely occluded right basilic vein . 
She has some pain in the right arm , especially with movement . 
The PICC line was pulled and she was admitted for anticoagulation . 
Of note , she was recently discharged after she was admitted with Enterococcal bacteremia ( vanco sensitive ) ; she finished her course of ampicillin yesterday . 
She has otherwise been doing well at rehab - - she has been slowly diuresed and is making some progress with PT . 
Past Medical History : PMH / PSH : 1 ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia type M 2 s / p matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant [ * * 1 0 - 2 9 * * ] ; complicated by GVHD of the liver , skin and lungs . 
Currently unemployed . 
Previously worked as stock clerk . 
Quit smoking 2 years ago . 
Occasional EtOH use . 
Family History : No history of oncologic diseases . 
Physical Exam : Vitals on arrival to the floor : 9 7 . 7 , 6 0 , 1 2 0 / 9 2 , 1 0 0 % 3 L NC Gen : Obese cushingoid female pleasant , sitting up in bed .

No areas of cellulitis on legs or arms . 
Some weeping of clear fluid from anterior left leg and right arm ( at sites where she has scabs and scratches ) . 
Extremities somewhat cool to touch , but 2 + DPP b / l and radial pulse . 
Neuro : CN II - XII grossly intact . 
Gait deferred . 
Upper extremities : No increases tone . 
No reflexes elicited . 
Brief Hospital Course : 1 . 
Anasarca : The patient appeared to be total body overloaded by intravascularly dry at admission . 
She [ * * Month / Day / Year 1 8 3 4 * * ] right heart catheterization on [ * * 2 1 2 6 - 1 2 - 6 * * ] that showed pulmonary hypertension ( systolic BP 4 5 , diastolic BP 2 0 , mean BP 2 8 ) . 
She was therefore started on sildenafil . 
The nephrology service was consulted , and she diuresed well on a regimen on albumin , lasix , and chlorthiazide ( then metolazone ) . 
Her diuresis was discontinued on [ * * 1 - 8 * * ] because of development of hypotension occuring in the setting of a urinary tract infection . 
Subsequently , she was transferred to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] for hypotension ( see below ) where sildenafil was d / c ' d as the patient was unlikely benefiting from it in the setting of relatively mild to moderate pulmonary HTN and overall systemic hypotension . 
UTI : She developed a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas on [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacin then ciprofloxacin . 
A repeat urine culture was obtained for followup on [ * * 1 - 2 * * ] although she was afebrile and had no urinary complaints . 
This culture again grew out Pseudomonas , this time quinolone resistant . 
Her foley catheter was changed , as she refused to have it removed . 
She subsequently developed a fever to 1 0 1 . 3 on [ * * 1 - 7 * * ] and was started on cefepime , with addition of vancomycin and flagyl on [ * * 1 - 8 * * ] . 
Upon transfer to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] for hypotension and tachycardia ( see below ) , she was continued on vancomycin , cefepime , and flagyl . 
A central venous line and arterial line were placed under sterile conditions . 
After 2 4 hours in the ICU , the patient was on 3 pressors with the differential diagnosis including septic vs . cardiogenic shock . 
Meropenem was added as for double gram - negative and Psuedomonas coverage . 
In spite of maximal medical therapy , the patient remained maxed out on 3 pressors . 
A repeat family meeting was held with the pt ' s HCP and mother , who agreed to make the patient CMO . 
She expired shortly thereafter . 
An autospy was offered , but declined . 
Hypotension and tachycardia : She developed hypotension to the 7 0 ' s sytolic on [ * * 1 - 8 * * ] which responded initially to fluid boluses . 
Her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresis and possible urosepsis . 
She developed tachycardia to the 1 2 0 ' s on [ * * 1 - 9 * * ] with a new RBBB . 
She was transferred to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] where she was given adenosine 6 mg X 2 with conversion to sinus tachycaria after the second dose of adenosine . 
However , she went back into a wide complex tachycardia with a RBBB pattern soon thereafter . 
The cardiology team evaluated her and felt that this rhythm was most likely an SVT with rate related aberancy ; however the following day , after reviewing the EKG strips with the EP attending , the patient was determined to have a fasicular ventricular tachycardia in the setting of no known prior CAD or ischemic scar . 
The treatment of choice in this setting would have been verapimil ; however this was not feasible as the patient was already on 3 pressors ( neo , levophed , and vasopressin ) . 
The following day , a dose of verapimil was tried given concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock ( however the patient ' s extremities remained warm to palpation , which suggested likely septic shock ) with conversion back to sinus tachycardia . 
She was not cardioverted secondary to the patient ' s wishes to remain DNR / DNI . 
Given the patient ' s lack of improvement in spite of maximal medical care , the patient was made CMO after another family meeting and expired shortly thereafter . 
C . diff colitis : She experienced loose stools after admission and a stool sample was positive for C . diff toxin on [ * * 1 2 - 8 * * ] ; she was subsequently treated with a 1 4 day course of flagyl . 
This was restarted on [ * * 1 - 8 * * ] as noted above in the context of recurrent fever and increased stooling . 
Right basilic vein thrombosis : The patient ' s PICC line was removed and she was started on IV heparin and then coumadin . 
Her anticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positive stools and widely varying INR ( thought likely to be due to interactions with her many medications ) . 
A repeat ultrasound of the upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombus therefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation . 
AML with history of GVHD : She was continued on cyclosporine , Cellcept , and her prednisone was titrated down per BMT recommendations . 
Elevated LFTs : Her transaminases , alkaline phosphatase , and bilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondary to GVHD of the liver after review of her medication list and right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causes of these findings . 
Her alkaline phosphatase elevation was probably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bone specific fraction was elevated as well . 
Acute renal failure : The patient ' s creatinine was 1 . 3 at admission peaking at 1 . 9 . 
She was thought to be intravascularly dry with prerenal failure . 
Her creatinine improved with addition of albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this . 
Pulmonary hypertension : Ms . [ * * Known lastname 2 8 3 3 1 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 1 8 3 4 * * ] right heart catheterization on [ * * 1 2 - 7 * * ] to assess whether pulmonary hypertension might be contributing to her significant edema . 
This study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 2 8 and she was subsequently started on sildenafil , which was subsequently d / c ' d upon transfer to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] ( see above ) . 
Heme positive stools : As noted above , she had heme positive stools in the setting of anticoagulation with IV heparin and warfarin and recent C . difficile colitis infectoin . 
In addition , she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and was receiving steroids for her GVHD . 
She was started on a PPI and her Hct was followed closely . 
Hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency : The patient ' s PTH was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes noted on plain films included osteitis fibrosa . 
She was evaluated by the endocrinology consult service who felt that her hyperparathyroidism was likely secondary , perhaps due to renal failure or steroid use . 
Her vitamin D levels were rechecked and found to be low . 
She was started on weekly vitamin D and daily calcium . 
She will need repeat vitamin D studies and should follow up with endocrinology for further management . 
She was started on a bisphosphonate per endocrine recs . 
Pulmonary osteoarthropathy : She complained of diffuse body pains and aches . 
Imaging of her extremities was notable for diffuse periosteal reaction . 
The endocrinology service reviewed the films and felt the history and imaging were most consistent with pulmonary osteoarthropathy . 
Her pain was treated with oral dilaudid as needed for pain control . 
Eye pains : Ms . [ * * Known lastname 2 8 3 3 1 * * ] complained of eye soreness . 
This was thought to be secondary to GVHD . 
She was started on cyclosporin eye drops and artificial tears . 
She was evaluated by the opthalmology consult service who recommended addition of Refresh eye drops which she continued with relief of her symptoms . 
Briefly , she presented 2 days ago with hematemsis and melana x 1 day and was sent in by her PCP . 
She was admitted to the ICU . 
Post transfusion Hct 2 9 , then down to 2 7 , another 1 U pRBC , then Hct 3 0 . 
EGD showed gastric ulcers with likely recent bleed , but no intervention was undertaken except for biopsies which are still spending . 
GI service was consulted and recommended [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] IV PPI . 
She was Briefly electively intubated for EGD for concerns of airway protection , then extubated without complication . 
She has not been hypotensive since admision , and atually was hypertensive to SBP 2 0 0 s due to discontinuing home BP meds , and got IV labetalol . 
She has now been restarted on home oral PO meds . 
Her stay in the ICU was unfortunately complicated by a fever to 1 0 1 . 6 - repeat CXR after extubation showed a possible LLL infiltrate vs . effusion vs . atelectasis which was suspicious for VAP and she was started on cefepime Vancomycin today on [ * * 1 0 - 1 4 * * ] . 
Of note , she was scheduled for lower extremity PVD revascularization , and the GI and vascular surgery services have been coordinating her outpatient antiplatelet regimen in the setting of this GI bleed Pt is feeling well today and says she does not feel light headed , dizzy , or fatigued . 
She reports no abdominal pain right now .

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST ( Final [ * * 2 1 1 2 - 1 0 - 1 4 * * ] ) : NEGATIVE BY EIA . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient . 
Bibasilar opacity is likely atelectasis larger on the left . 
Pneumonia cannot be excluded . 
There is no pneumothorax . 
The aorta is tortuous . 
The patient underwent EGD which showed multiple ulcers in the stomach with evidence of recent bleed . 
She was transfused 3 U pRBCs during the admission - two in the ED and one in the MICU , and put on IV PPI and sucralfate . 
Patient was hemodynamically stable throughout with and hematocrits held around 3 0 . 
These meds were d / ced on the floor as repeat CXR did not show good evidence of pneumonia and she did not look clinically infected . 
She was treated empirically with Vancomycin 7 5 mg q 1 2 and Cefepime 1 g q 1 2 hr . 
A repeat CXR PA and Lateral was obtained which was not impressive for an infiltrate - the patient remained asymptomatic and afebrile so the abx were discontinued at 2 4 hrs . 
However , on exam the patient was noted to have crackles about halfway up on both lung fields . 
She was given a one time IV dose of lasix and restarted on her home regimen . 
Her oxygen requirements were optimized by the time of discharge and she was on her home lasix regimen . 
She was noted to have downtrending WBCs to 1 . 6 by [ * * 1 0 - 1 5 * * ] and was technically still anemic . 
A smear noted some occasional schistocytes but hemolysis labs were negative . 
Hematology was consulted and thought the vancomycin or cefepime was causing marrow toxicity . 
She was monitored for the next few days until her counts began to increase . 
They went up to WBC 2 . 6 2 1 % neutrophils ( ANC still below 1 0 0 0 ) . 
Per heme recs she was given 1 dose of neupogen . 
Her CBC then increased to WBC 7 . 1 with almost 7 0 % neutrophils . 
She was discharged with close follow up with her hematologist . Her CBC was closely monitored during her hospital stay . 
She actually became hypertensive during this time . 
Upon arrival to the floor her home BP meds were restarted as below . 
She remained stable , although with an episode of overnight hypertension 2 days prior to discharge . 
This was obviously postponed , but the issue of her anticoagulation remained . 
She had a prior DVT which she takes warfarin for but this has been held since [ * * Month ( only ) 1 1 6 * * ] due to recurrent GI bleeds . 
The vascular surgery team expressed they would like her anticoagulated for her PVD . 
After consulting with both GI and Vascular it was decided that she could go out on plavix , and hold aspirin given her risk of rethrombosis in her vascular stents combined with the stability of the bleed .

Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
You were given 2 units of blood in the emergency department and then transferred to the ICU and given 1 unit of blood . 
The gastroenterologists took you down for an endoscopy which showed a recently bleeding ulcer - they took biopsies of it which showed inflammation - there was no other intervention performed . 
You were briefly given antibiotics for pneumonia but were taken off after 2 4 hrs treatment . 
Your WBCs were noted to be abnormally low and a hematology consult was obtained . 
It was thought that either the vancomycin or cefepime caused your low blood counts . 
We watched them for a few days and they struggled to increase . 
You received one dose of neupogen , which helps stimulate the bone marrow , and were cleared for discharge as your WBC increased to 7 . 1 with almost 6 0 % neutrophils . 
Please make this appointment .

He was initially treated with vanc and cipro for question of septic left knee ; the aspirate showed [ * * Numeric Identifier * * ] WBC and 9 4 % PMN but neg gram stain and culture and no crystals so abx discontinued . 
LENI was negative for DVT or [ * * Hospital Ward Name * * ] cyst . 
No fx on x - ray . 
This was thought to be a psoriatic arthritis flare , so his prednisone was increased from his home dose of 3 0 mg to 6 0 mg daily with improvement in his inflammation . 
His pain subsequently reutrned and repeat LENI was negative . 
Pt was started on gabapentin for presumed fibromyalgia and discharged yesterday on a stable pain regimen of MS contin with prn dilaudid . 
He saw Rheum today who referred him to Derm for evaluation of a superficial erythematous plaque , questioned erythema nodosum . 
Derm did not think this was consistent but was concerned about compartment syndrome so referred pt to ED . 
In the ER , vitals were : T 9 8 . 2 , P 7 9 , BP 1 4 5 / 7 7 , RR 1 7 , O 2 sat 9 8 . 
LENI neg for DVT but pt was noted to have an extensive left posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection . 
Ortho did not see evidence of compartment syndrome and recommended vascular c / s to rule out necrotizing fasciitis given the fluid collection . 
Vascular did not think this was consistent with necrotizing fasciitis . 
An MRI of the LE was done per Rads recs , and this showed small fluid collections concerning for abscess in his gastrocnemius that were too small to be drained with no evidence of osteomyelitis . 
He was given vancomycin , zosyn , and clindaycin . 
He also received his home meds of gabapentin , MS contin , and po dilaudid . 
He was admitted to medicine with VS on transfer : T 9 8 . 5 , P 7 6 , BP 1 3 6 / 6 8 , RR 1 5 , O 2 sat 9 8 RA . 
On evaluation on the floor , patient complains of persistent LE pain and tenderness which is controlled on his pain regimen . 
His LLE knee effusion has improved markedly since his recent admission . 
He denies any fevers , chills , or night sweats . 
ROS : Mild constipation d / t pain meds . 
Review of systems otherwise negative .

Pitting edema b / l . 
DP / PT pulses 2 + b / l . 
Neuro : AAOx 3 , strength 5 / 5 in LE . 
Imaging : [ * * 2 2 0 2 - 1 - 2 0 * * ] US : No significant change in size of fluid collection in the left popliteal fossa extending into the left posterior calf , which contains small foci of gas . 
No evidence of left lower extremity DVT between the left popliteal and common femoral veins . 
Left popliteal fossa collection extending into the calf , again seen . 
Redemonstration of two loculated fluid collections in the left calf . 
Slightly increased inferior extent of the collection along the anteromedial edge of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle . 
Otherwise no significant change . 
Subcutaneous edema along the anterior left leg , in keeping with cellulitis , unchanged . 
Small loculates of air within the lower collection is attributed to recent aspiration procedure . 
No other evidence of soft tissue emphysema identified . 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size . 
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis . 
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve , but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
There is no mitral valve prolapse . 
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve , but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality . 
No mitral regurgitation is seen . 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
IMPRESSION : Suboptimal image quality . 
No obvious echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis . 
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global LV systolic function . 
Mild pulmonary hypertension . 
If clinically suggested , the absence of a vegetation by 2 D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis . 
Persisted popliteus muscle collection and collection at the anteromedial aspect of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle . 
Post - surgical findings following incision and drainage is a new collection posterior to the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle , contiguous with the medial open skin defect and contains low signal intensity foci , which may be due to air or possibly packing . 
Muscle edema in the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle and vastus medialis obliquus muscle , likely postoperative . 
A small knee joint effusion and mild synovitis without definite findings of septic arthritis . 
As previously noted , the popliteus tendon sheath can communicate with the knee joint . 
Cartilage thinning and subchondral cysts along patella may be degenerative . 
Clinical correlation is requested . 
Large complex fluid collection tracking from the left popliteal fossa along the medial left calf to the proximal mid calf region . 
Since it is difficult to fully assess the extent and geography of this collection on ultrasound , an MRI is suggested for further characterization . 
Smaller fluid collection at the left anterior knee measuring 3 . 5 cm . 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg . 
Extensive left posterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection . 
Two loculated fluid collections concerning for abcess collections , one in the substance of the popliteus muscle , and the other along the anteromedial edge of the medial gastrocnemius muscle . 
Subcutaneous edema likely represents cellulitis in this setting . 
No evidence of osteomyelitis . 
Limited assessment of knee joint - - please see comment ( No obvious direct communication between these collections and the knee joint effusion is identified , but the popliteus abscess does extend along the popliteus tendon , which can communicate with the knee in some patients . 
All urine lytes testing indicated pre - renal etiology . 
Resolved after fluid challenge . 
He again had acute renal failure on [ * * 2 2 0 2 - 1 - 2 7 * * ] in the setting of having received increased doses of pain medications and resultant hypoperfusion . 
His peak creatinine was 3 . 0 , and resolved to his baseline of 0 . 8 - 0 . 9 by the time of discharge . 
No compartment syndrome per Orthopedic evaluation . 
No osteomyelitis on MRI and not consistent with necrotizing fascitis per Vascular surgery . 
It was noted on imaging that he had gastroceminis fluid collection and overlying cellulitis . 
No signs of septic joint from evaluation of knee aspiration . 
He had one positive blood culture with pan - sensitive staph . 
He was placed on zosyn , later narrowed to nafcillin . 
All other microbiology data were negative . 
IR and vascular surgery helped drained the fluid collection . 
Leg incision is to heal via secondary intention . 
He developed a body rash that was determined to be folliculitis . 
He completed the 2 week course IV antibiotics in house . 
His major issue remained to be pain management . 
He required a large amount of narcotics to control his pain , but after overdose ( see below ) he was switched to a very conservative regimen . 
It was determined that the swelling / fluid collection is from psoriatic arthritis versus idiopathic spondylarthropathy . 
He was discharged in stable condition . 
Muscle biospy showed necrotic muscle with granulation tissue . 
Later that night , Pt fell while ambulating . 
He had a CT scan which was negative for acute intracranial pathologu . 
Morning after the fall , Pt was noted to be somnolent and hypotensive . 
He was given Naloxone 0 . 4 mg X 3 and would arouse briefly after each dose . 
He continued to be hypotensive after a bolus of 1 L of NS . 
He was transferred to the MICU for further monitoring . 
In the MICU he was monitored closely and his hypotension and mental status gradually improved . 
He was called out back to the floor on [ * * 2 2 0 2 - 1 - 2 8 * * ] . 
He never required intubation . 
After being called out , he was normotensive and alert and oriented X 3 . 
It was believed his hypotension and altered mental status were caused by medication overdose in the setting of acute kidney injury . 
He was discharged on oxycodone 5 mg Q 4 hours , which he did well on for the 3 days prior to his discharge . 
He will follow up with the pain clinic as an outpatient . 
Rheumatology was consulted and suggested to decrease prednison level to 2 0 mg from 3 0 mg .

You were admitted because your left knee was swollen , red and painful and you also had a pain on your left leg and foot . 
The rheumatology team evaluated and took fluid from your knee . 
You were initially treated with antibiotic for possible infection and pain medications . 
The fluid was cultured for infection but this was negative . 
You did have a blood culture that was positive and we provided you with a two week course of antibiotics . 
We also had interventional radiology and vascular surgery to help drain the fluids from your leg . 
This helped your swelling . 
You required a lot of pain medications to control the pain , and at one point went to the ICU because your system did not clear the medicines adequately . 
You are now on a much more conservative pain regimen . 
You will follow up with pain doctors as [ * * Name 5 ( PTitle ) * * ] outpatient . 
We determined that the fluid collection is not due to infection , and more likely a rheumatological problem . 
Please note we made the following changes to your medications . 
Decrease prednisone from 6 0 mg to 2 0 mg 2 . 
Stop MSContin 3 . 
Stop gabapentin 4 . 
Stop dilaudid 5 .

Brief Hospital Course : 8 5 - year - old man with Kaposi ' s sarcoma with visceral involvement , CHF , CKD presents with confusion , dyspnea , odynophagia , generalized weakness . 
Goals of Care : Patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia to the high 8 0 s from pulmonary edema and the plan to initiate dialysis to remove fluid . 
The patient did receive one round of dialysis before he and his family decided to change his goals of care . 
While in the ICU , it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures only . 
The patient was started on a Morphine drip , Benadryl for itching related uremia , and Haldol for terminal delirium . 
The patient was subsequently transfered to the oncology inpatient service . 
Pt expired the following night . 
Dyspnea : Patient presented with some wheezing on exam , bilateral crackles R > L . 
CT showed right - sided pleural effusion . 
Intermittently tachypneic but with good O 2 saturation . 
There is no clear evidence of pneumonia . 
Patient does not have significant coughs and the chest CT showed no clear infiltrate . 
Antibiotics were discontinued on the oncology service . 
The patient received nebs prn . 
Patient further received Furosemide given concern for CHF on exam . 
Pt had one round of dialysis but did not resolve pt ' s tachypnea . 
Confusion : Not at home but started being delirious at [ * * Hospital 1 9 4 8 7 * * ] . 
Might be due to hospitalization - related delirium in an elderly person , CHF exacerbation , pneumonia . 
Head bleed is a possible cause given thrombocytopenia . 
Uremia ( urea > 1 0 0 ) from CKD was ultimately presumed to be the most likely cause . 
HTN : Normotensive on admission . 
The patient was continued on Hydralazine , Labetolol and Ranolazine initially , though these meds were held for hypotension that may likely happen with dialysis . 
Odynophagia : Was presumed due to mucositis from recent chemotherapy . 
Patient received pain control with narcotics and was monitored closely for thrush . 
Pt was also started on Fluc and Acyclovir . 
CKD : Cr 4 . 0 at baseline but urea in the 1 3 0 s from the usual 8 0 s . 
The patient subsequently received one round of dialysis before his goals of care were changed . 
Kaposi ' s sarcoma with known visceral involvement : Patient was pancytopenic from recent chemotherapy . 
Pt was started on Neupogen and WBC responded appropriately . 
Pt was DNR / DNI on admission , then made CMO in ICU . 
Pt was NPO given high risk of aspiration .

On a CT scan in [ * * 2 1 5 1 - 8 - 1 4 * * ] , there was an incidental finding of a focal aneurysmal outpouching of his ascending aorta along with a left lingula mass . 
Further review by Dr . [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] thought it looked like a penetrating atherosclerotic plaque that had ulcerated and that it was only covered by a very thin aortic wall and thus was at risk for rupture . 
He underwent a stent graft repair of this in [ * * 2 1 5 1 - 1 1 - 1 4 * * ] . 
Follow - up CT scan has shown an endoleak with expanding pseudoaneurysm into his aortic arch . 
Given his endoleak and expanding psuedoaneurysm , it has been decided to return to the operating room for repair .

A large lesion in the right frontal lobe , measuring 6 . 8 x 5 . 2 x 9 cm , seen to extend into the region of the frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] of the right lateral ventricle , and in proximity to the septum pellucidum . 
Given the large size and lack of priors , the exact site of origin of the lesion is not clear . 
This can either represent a low - grade neoplasm vs a complex cyst , with the differential diagnosis including subependymoma , pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma , oligodendroglioma , the latter two being less likely given the pattern of enhancement and lack of calcifications . 
An unusual complex cyst cannot be completely excluded . 
The lesion does appear to have some vascularity , with tiny vessels noted within the lesion .

No evidence of infarction . 
FLAIR abnormality around the surgical resection margin may be related to recent surgery , though residual tumor cannot be excluded . 
While there is no abnormal enhancement , there is no enhancement of the tumor prior to surgery , so this cannot be used as metric . 
Brief Hospital Course : Patient presented to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED after having an MRI of her brain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed her to have a right frontal mass which communicated with the right lateral ventricle . 
She was evaluated by neuromedicine and neurosurgery in the ED and was admitted to the neurosurgery service . 
A CTA / V was obtained to gain information on the vascularity of the mass .

She remained stable on the floor overnight and on [ * * 1 0 - 1 1 * * ] was taken to the OR for surgery . 
Surgery was without complication . 
She was admitted to the ICU but remained in the PACU overnight . 
Post op CT revealed good resection and no hemorrhage . 
ON POD # 1 she was neurologically intact . 
She was cleared for transfer to the floor .

QUALITY OF SPECIMEN CANNOT BE ASSESSED . 
YEAST . 
MODERATE GROWTH . 
Imaging : [ * * 2 1 6 9 - 2 - 1 6 * * ] CXR - Endotracheal tube 2 . 5 cm from the carina . 
Linear parenchymal opacities in the right upper lung , potentially chronic ; however , followup of this region recommended on future exams . 
No acute intracranial abnormality . 
Generalized parenchymal atrophy with changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease . 
Confluent hypodensity in the central pons likely represents additional sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease , given the such findings in other typical locations . 
However , possiblity of osmotic myelinolysis ( " central pontine myelinolysis " ) cannot be excluded entirely , in the appropriate clinical context . 
Tiny , 2 mm aneurysm arising from the proximal portion of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery . 
Unremarkable CTA of the neck . 
Prominence of superior ophthalmic veins in both orbits , likely varices . 
Severe emphysematous changes in the visualized lung apices with ill - defined nodular opacities in the right upper lobe . 
Comparison with previous ( outside ) cross - sectional studies , if available , is advised . 
No evidence for pulmonary embolus with suboptimal opacification of the left lower lobe subsegmental arteries where there is scarring ; therefore , pulmonary embolus cannot be excluded in this region . 
Severe emphysema . 
Trace bilateral pleural effusions . 
TTE [ * * 2 - 2 1 * * ] - The left atrium is normal in size . 
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and global systolic function are normal ( LVEF 6 5 % ) . 
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied . 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
Mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation . 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
Tricuspid valve prolapse is present . 
Moderate [ 2 + ] tricuspid regurgitation is seen . 
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion . 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade . 
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures . 
CXR [ * * 3 - 2 * * ] - As compared to the previous radiograph , there is no relevant change . 
Large lung volumes , moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema . 
No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions . 
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities . 
Brief Hospital Course : 7 7 year old female with h / o COPD on 2 L nc , hypercarbic resp failure , HTN , pulmonary nodules who was found to be unresponsive at her nursing home , intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress , found to be hypothermic in ED , hyperNa , and w / fluctuating BPs . 
Her pH suggests compensated process and elevated bicarb suggest that her respiratory status likely has deteriorated over a chronic period of time due to worsening COPD . 
Although CXR was not notable for PNA , CTA showed some suggestion of retrocardiac opacities and sputum w / Gram positive cocci on gram stain . 
PE was ruled out w / CTA . 
Patient was treated for HCAP ( vancomycin , levofloxacin and cefepime ) , along with standing nebulizers . 
There was difficulty controlling her anxiety with recurrent hyperventilation on pressure support . 
Initial extubation attempt on [ * * 2 - 2 0 * * ] failed due to tachypnea , low minute ventilation and eventually hypercarbic respiratory failure . 
Patient was continued on HCAP coverage and started on steroids for COPD exacerbation and marked bronchospasm on examination . 
TTE showed a moderate pericardial effusion w / o signs of tamponade with diastolic dysfunction . 
Patient underwent IV diuresis . 
A major barrier to her extubation was felt to be anxiety leading to tachypnea , in addition to above factors . 
She was tried on multiple sedative and antipsychotics and best regiment was felt to be clonazepam 0 . 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] ( prior attempted medications w / o significant improvement - xanax , ativan , zydis , seroquel ) . 
Per [ * * Hospital 1 2 1 7 7 * * ] records , baseline ABG was confirmed to be 7 . 3 3 - 3 7 / 7 0 - 8 0 / 3 9 / 8 0 - 1 0 0 . 
Patient was extubated on [ * * 2 - 2 6 * * ] . 
She tolerated this well , however was noted to be very sensitive to hyperoxia ( as during nebulizer treatments or increased supplemental oxygen ) with resultant hypercarbia , resp . 
This improved w / reduction of supplemental O 2 . 
She was restarted on antibiotics with vancomycin , levofloxacin , cefepime though there was no CXR evidence of recurrent pneumonia . 
She was narrowed to levofloxacin and remained afebrile and stable . 
Her goal O 2 sat should be 8 8 - 9 2 to prevent resultant hypercarbia and acidosis . 
Patient ' s Advair dosing was increased to 5 0 0 / 5 0 and tiotropium was restarted w / albuterol inhalers . 
Nebulizers were discontinued seondary to hyperoxia as above . 
Patient was stable on 1 . 5 L NC at the time of discharge , sat ' ing 8 8 - 9 6 % . 
Patient will continue levofloxacin through [ * * 2 1 6 9 - 3 - 1 0 * * ] for total 8 days treatment . 
Patient w / leukocytosis and hypothermia on admission , though infectious w / o negative . 
Labs also notable for hyperNa , and appeared volume depleted by exam . 
CTA head / neck unremarkable , and neuro exam in non - focal . 
Seizure seemed unlikely given the above factors . 
No meningeal signs on exam . 
Urine and blood cultures were negative ; sputum culture positive as above . 
Sodium was corrected . 
Much of this was felt to be due to transient hypercarbia and benzodiazapines . 
At time of discharge , patient was alert and oriented x 3 . 
She was tolerated clonazepam 0 . 5 mg qAM and qHS . 
Lactate mildly elevated . 
Hypotensive in the ED , but normotensive in ICU . 
See above for further discussion . 
Patient completed vancomycin and zosyn course for HCAP . 
On return to the ICU , concern for RLL pneumonia , so patient was restarted on antibiotics , vancomycin and levofloxacin . 
Patient was narrowed to levofloxacin and is now day [ * * 5 - 1 2 * * ] , should be dosed through [ * * 2 1 6 9 - 3 - 1 0 * * ] . 
Albuterol inhaler as needed and daily tioptrium restarted per home regimen . 
Patient is on a long steroid taper , currently 3 0 mg po daily , with plan to decrease weekly by 1 0 mg ( next decrease Saturday [ * * 2 1 6 9 - 3 - 1 2 * * ] ) . 
TTE here showed moderate effusion that seemed unchanged on repeat TTE .

He had asthma exacerbation 3 wks ago requiring prednisone taper , which he completed about 1 wk ago . 
Over the past few days , he has had productive cough and pleuritic chest pain , but no F / C . 
Went to [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] HC on day of admission and was treated w / albuterol / atroven nebs and solumedrol , but symptoms were unrelieved , prompting referral of pt to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED . 
In ED , he was placed on continuous nebs and given prednisone 4 0 mg , then admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] for ongoing care . 
On arrival to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] , ABG was 7 . 2 9 / 4 7 / 8 3 , which was concerning for respiratory fatigue . 
He was treated w / heliox and eventually offered BiPAP , though he refused BiPAP treatment . 
Though he was afebrile , empiric treatment for CAP was begun w / ceftriaxone and azithromycin . 
He was found to have RSV infection on viral culture , which is a likely explanation for his current asthma exacerbation . 
His respiratory status improved steadily until the present time , when he is transferred to the Medicine team for ongoing care . 
Currently , the pt complains of ongoing dyspnea and cough that are moderately controlled w / nebulized albuterol . 
He complains of lumbar back pain that is partially relieved by percocet .

Since previous tracing of [ * * 2 2 0 0 - 3 - 1 2 * * ] , lateral T wave amplitude lower . 
CULTURE CONFIRMATION PENDING . 
Brief Hospital Course : 1 . 
Asthma Exacerbation : Pt ' s nasal washings returned positive for RSV . 
On admission he had marked wheezing and poor air movement , with ABG of [ * * 2 1 4 2 - 9 - 4 * * ] / 8 3 . 
He gradually improved on solumedrol , continuous nebs , advair , singulair , heliox , Azithro ( 5 days ) and Ceftriaxone . 
Pt did not require intubation , and his nebs were spaced out to q 4 hrs . 
Pt ' s breathing was comfortable and non - wheezy by HD # 5 when observed from the door , however , pt appears to exagerate end - expiratory wheezing and laboured breathing when approached . 
He was felt to have a component of psychogenic dyspnea overlying his asthma exacerbation . 
He was slowly titrated down on his steroid dose , and he frequently requested to be placed on higher doses of steroids despite an improving exam and vitals . 
Eventually , he had both subjectively and objectively improved to the point where he was tolerating oral steroids and was able to be discharged home on a taper with plans to follow - up with his outpatient pulmonologist . 
Psych / Neuro : Cocaine Abuse and Opioid Dependence . 
Pt ' s urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and opioids . 
Pt was requiring two percocets every 4 hours for low back pain s / p laminectomy . 
Attempts to wean his percocets were made in effort to minimize suppression of his cough . 
However , pt was unhappy with this recommendation and insisted on his usual dose of percocets , stating that the wheezing / coughing greatly exacerbated the back pain . 
He was seen by the addictions consult and social work while he was an inpatient ; their discussions culminated in an agreement that Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] would seek outpatient counseling for his substance abuse difficulties , which are both worsened by and worsen his chronic pain . 
He was discharged on a brief course of oxycodone / acetaminophen , with the understanding that should he have ongoing pain medication requirements , he would need to finally establish a primary care physician ; he has been stating that this is something he would do , but has failed to do so for months . 
He was provided with multiple names and numbers of providers in his area , and he informed the team that he was dedicated to being seen by one of them . 
Hypertension : Pt was hypertensive on admission in setting of his acute asthma exacerbation . 
He continued to be hypertensive and HCTZ was started , with a good effect and was tolerated well . 
His electrolytes and renal function remained stable on this new medication , and he was advised to see a primary care doctor to follow both this and his numerous other medical issues .

Left lower lobe was collapsed in [ * * Month ( only ) 1 0 9 6 * * ] , now reexpanded and densely consolidated . 
There may be left hilar adenopathy and small left pleural effusion . 
Overall , findings are consistent with extensive pneumonia though under the appropriate clinical circumstances , this could be infiltrated malignancy . 
Small region of ground - glass opacity in the right apex persists since the chest CT done on [ * * 2 1 1 4 - 1 - 1 3 * * ] . 
Mild - to - moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung shows some mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe pulmonary edema is playing any role .

Mild - to - moderate brain atrophy is seen . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Multiple small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts including infarct in the left frontal watershed distribution as described above . 
Mild diffuse decreased signal within the bony structures of the head could be due to marrow hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical correlation recommended .

She received 5 UPRBC with improvement of her HCT from 1 3 . 6 on admission to 2 3 . 2 . 
She developed respitratory distress likely secondary to combined insult of her pneumonia and volume overload for which she triggered . 
She was found to be in flash pulmonary edema . 
She received supportive therapy . 
Her respiratory status improved and she was transferred to the floor . 
She was started on albuterol nebulizer treatement for possible bronchospasm , but this may not need to be continued at the rehabilitation facility . 
PNA / recurrent fevers : She had presented to clinic where she was found to be febrile to 1 0 2 and neutropenic . 
She was started on vancomycin and cefepime . 
A DFA was negative . 
Blood cultures were negative . 
In the interim , the patient was managed with meropenem , voriconazole , azithromycin , and vancomcyin in the setting of recurrent fevers and night sweats . 
She was discharged after being afebrile for 1 - 2 days , with a short course of meropenem to be completed . 
MDS / Anemia : She has a history of sideroblastic anemia for which she is on azacitidine . 
She received 5 units of pRBC over the first 2 days of her hospitalization . 
There was a consideration , given the recurrent fevers and night sweats , that the patient had a hematologic etiology , perhaps transformation to AML . 
A smear was obtained and was unremarkable , so bone marrow biopsy was deferred . 
She received a unit of pRBC on the day of discharge , which she completed prior to transfer to rehabilitation . 
Altered mental status / right hand - wrist weakness : The patient developed right hand / wrist weakness on [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] .

Hepatic US showed Small amount of free perihepatic fluid , collapsed gallbladder with wall edema , and small amount of pericholecystic fluid . 
LFTs were improved by day of discharge . 
Neutropenic Fever : Her neutropenia was likely secondary to her chemotherapy . 
She was placed on neutropenic precautions and her ANC was trended . 
Her neutropenia resolved with periodic dosing of neupogen . 
She had had no fevers for 1 - 2 days prior to discharge . 
Per ID recommendations , she was discharged on meropenem , to be continued for six days following discharge . 
Prophylaxis : She did not receive heparin SQ prophylactically given the contraindication posed by her azacitidine therapy . 
As her platelet count remained normal , and there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on imaging , SC heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis .

Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to the hospital because you were fatigued and having fevers . 
You were found to have a pneumonia treated with antibiotics . 
You also received blood transfusions . 
Your breathing initially improved , however your lungs became overloaded with fluid and you went to the intensive care unit . 
Your breathing improved and you came back to the regular floor . 
You coninued to have difficulty with your breathing and continued to have fevers so procedures were done to sample your lung fluid to culture and remove some of the fluid , which did not show obvious infection . 
Your pnuemonia was treated with antibiotics . 
You also developed some mild confusion and right hand weakness , due to a stroke , which was seen on MRI . 
A lumbar puncture did not show any infection of your cerebrospinal fluid . 
You had an EEG exam to look for seizure activity , the final results of which were pending at the time of discharge . 
The following changes were made to your medications : - You were started on MEROPENEM , an intravenous antibiotic . 
You will have an IV line placed at the rehabilitation facility to receive this medication . 
You will continue to take this for six days post - discharge , with your last doses on [ * * 2 1 1 5 - 1 - 8 * * ] . 
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you feel faint , light headed , experience nausea , vomiting , constipation , headache , blurry vision , weight loss , night sweats , chest pain , abdominal pain , shortness of breath , muscle aches , joint aches , fever , blood in your stool or urine , or any other symptoms that are concerning to you . 
Her symptoms began in [ * * Month ( only ) * * ] ( after a recent hospitalization ) , when she developed diarrhea ( which she relates to her metoprolol ) . 
The diarrhea ( multiple times daily , non - bloody , brown in color ) initially improved but then worsened again . 
She then developed nausea , vomiting , and dry heaves , without abdominal pain , and was admitted on [ * * 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] . 
She also reported worsening shortness of breath , 3 pillow orthopnea , and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . 
She was felt to be intravascularly dry , so she was given IV fluids . 
During the admission , an echocardiogram was performed , demonstrating worsening systolic function ( EF 1 5 - 2 0 % ) , but she was felt to be intravascularly dry , so her Lasix was held . 
Given the patient ' s concern that her diarrhea started at the same time as metoprolol ( 7 5 mg daily ) , this medication was also stopped ( and switched to carvedilol 3 . 1 2 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] ) . 
She was to have close follow up with her cardiologist . 
She had acute on chronic renal failure which returned to close to baseline ( 1 . 5 ) with IV fluids ; she had a renal biopsy during that admission , the results of which are still pending . 
Her Imuran was initially held during the last hospitalization but was restarted after a conversation with her [ * * Hospital 1 1 1 2 * * ] rheumatologist . 
During that hospitalization , her nausea was not fully explained , but there was a possibility that restarting her Imuran may have contributed . 
Her presentation today is similar . 
She has nausea and dry heaves ( non - bloody , non - bilious ) , along with worsening shortness of breath / PND / orthopnea . 
Her husband ( who follows her vitals closely ) has noted increased blood pressures and heart rates since she was discharged from the hospital . 
Given her worsened nausea and tachycardia to the 1 2 0 ' s , he brought her to the hospital . 
She denies any history of blood clot ( but had IUFD at 2 1 wks recently ) . 
In the ED , triage vitals were T 9 7 . 6 F , HR 1 2 4 , BP 1 2 6 / 1 0 9 , RR 1 8 , Sat 1 0 0 % . 
She was given 4 mg IV ondansteron x 2 , in addition to ceftriaxone and azithromycin given an equivocal chest x - ray . 
She was transferred to the floor for further evaluation . 
Her respiratory rate was noted to be as high as 3 3 . 
On review of systems , she reports nausea and vomiting , as well as shortness for breath and orthopnea as above . 
Diarrhea is unchanged . 
She denies fevers , chills , chest pain ( but perhaps some chest " heaviness " ) , palpitations , pleuritic chest pain , cough , weakness , numbness , tingling , abdominal pain , constipation , hematemesis , hematochezia , urinary symptoms .

Brief Hospital Course : 3 5 yF with multiple medical problems ( including SLE , restrictive lung disease , global cardiomyopathy with severely depressed systolic function , nephrotic syndrome ) , with recent admission [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 6 8 9 8 3 * * ] for nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , admitted with shortness of breath , tachycardia , and persistent nausea . 
Her cardiomyopathy was thought to be due to lupus . 
Peripartum cardiomyopathy was also considered however given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immune complexes seen on endocardial biopsy , lupus cardiomyopathy was thought to be more likely . 
She was treated with steroids , cytoxan , plasmaphoresis , IVIG and supportive care , and improved from an EF of 1 5 to 3 3 % . 
It is unclear which therapy led to improvement . 
She did require temporary CCU transfer for milrinone given worsening EF , however was weaned after a few days and transferred back to the floor in stable condition . 
Her mitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to her poor forward flow , and htn improved with diuresis , hydralazine , lisinopril and amlodipine . 
Reported 3 pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal noctural dyspnea , in the setting of recent d / c Lasix and IVF resuscitation , LE edema also suggested fluid overload . 
BNP extremely elevated at 6 5 , 1 8 7 . 
She also had non - specific sxs concerning for HF including throat tightness and GI sxs . 
Her sxs improved with diuresis and symptomatic management and she was discharged on oral torsemide . 
She was also treated with BP control and bblocker therapy . 
Given her SOB and LE edema R > L , a LE US was performed and showed no LE clot , therefore PE was thought to be unlikely . 
Pt diagnosed in [ * * 2 1 6 8 * * ] , manifested by kidney disease previously membranous nephropathy , facial rash , Sjogren ' s syndrome , Raynaud ' s phenomenon , and pleuritis . 
Previously followed by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 6 8 9 8 1 * * ] at B & W , however has requested to transfer her care to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] after this admission . 
Initially contined on Plaquenil and Imuran , as well as prednisone . 
Plaquenil dc ' d per rheumatology recs . 
Cardiomyopathy and renal failure on current admission were felt to be manifestation of underlying lupus . 
Rheumatology was consulted and recommended aggressive therapy with steriods , cytoxan and plasmapheresis . 
Received solumedrol 1 g daily x 3 followed by solumedrol 3 0 mg IV q 1 2 hrs , which was uptitrated to 6 0 q 1 2 hrs and subseuquently tapered and she was ultimately discharged on prednisone 6 0 mg orally daily . 
She was also placed on atovaquone PCP prophylaxis in the setting of immunosuppression . 
She recieved 1 dose of cytoxan 7 5 0 mg on [ * * 1 0 - 2 0 * * ] with mesna , cell counts with nadir on [ * * 1 1 - 5 * * ] . 
Prior to cytoxan , she received 7 . 5 mg Lupron for ovarian protection with plans to pursue egg harvesting for fertility as an outpatient . 
Received 5 cycles of plasmapheresis . 
Additional plasmaphoreis was considered but held due to her continued improvement . 
Initially thought secondary to restarting Imuran , however pt and husband attributed to bblocker therapy . 
Most likely due to gut edema in the setting of right HF . 
GI was consulted and agreed however recommended ruling out infectious etiology given her immunosuppression ; w / u was negative . 
She improved with symptomatic tx and treatment of her HH . 
Patient developed thrombocytopenia with nadir of 6 8 , likely multifactorial related to dilution , imunnosupression , and possibly pheresis . 
Heme consulted and recommended removing ASA , NSAIDs , all heparin products , f / u LFTs , fibrinogen . 
Platelet drop was too quick to be related to Cytoxan and likelihood of developping 4 T score is 3 . 
HIT ab negative . 
Fibrinogen nomralized . 
Thrombocytopenia quickly improved , however then fluctuated in the setting of cytoxan use . 
IgG and IgM ACA negative , so unlikely to have prothrombotic state . 
Pt previously with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy . 
She had repeat biopsy showing type 3 , 4 , 5 lupus nephritis . 
Worsening renal failure with creatinine increased to 3 . 7 up from 1 . 4 on admission . 
While her renal function showed some initial worsening with diuresis , diuresis was continued due to continued volume overload , and creatinine remained stable . 
Pt concerned that hydralazine may be causing joint pain . 
Given this and her improved renal function , lisinopril was uptitrated and hydralazine discontinued . 
Blood pressures stable . 
Pt was given one unit of PRBCs while in patient and started on epo with good improvement in her crit . 
Hydralazine was discontinued , symptomatic relief with tylenol , PT .

She lives at home with her and the patients husband who are her primary care givers . 
She is bedbound at baseline with quadraparesis with prominent rightsided weakness . 
This morning she was scheduled to see IR today to have G tube replace at 3 pm . 
This morning she had a questionable small seizure with non responsiveness and quivering of her lips but it was short lived . 
Daughter ; felt she had a low grade temp and a mild cough , but no overt illness . 
On the way to [ * * Hospital 3 9 7 1 7 * * ] she went into a generalized tonic clonic seizure at 2 : 3 0 pm with was refractory to 5 mg of ativan , she was intubated at 3 : 3 0 for airway protection and was given a paralytic so it was unclear if she was still seizing . 
They got a head ct and transferred her to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] for further management . 
They are often generalized and recover her to come to the emergency room . 
Seizure began around the beginning of her mental decline and discovery of her leukodystrophy back in 9 9 , she did have one seizure requiring intubation at that time . 
But cognitive decline started in 9 9 with slurred speech and weakness on one side , and wasn ' t sure if it was MS [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 2 5 8 0 9 * * ] and then had as seizure , has continued to decline and has been bedbound for about 6 years . 
Currently , her neurologic baseline is that she has some movement of limbs , weaker on right side ; does move a little bit , but not much , she fidgets a lot with her hands , rips blankets off and tips .

Severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy . 
The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3 . 4 cm above the carina . 
The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen . 
Contrast is seen within large bowel loops in the right upper quadrant . 
Linear areas of plate - like atelectasis in the right and left lower lungs are noted . 
There is no large consolidation or signs of CHF . 
No definite pneumothorax is present . 
The heart and mediastinal contours appear grossly unremarkable aside from atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob .

Brief Hospital Course : 6 4 - year - old right handed woman with a history of seizures , leukodystrophy , dementia , and G tube placement who presented as a transfer from [ * * Hospital 6 * * ] for status epilepticus . 
She had a GTC yesterday afternoon which was refractory to 5 mg of ativan and was subsequently intubated and paralyzed . 
Head CT showed severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy but no acute intracranial process . 
Upon transfer she was continuing to have some intermittent rhythmic movements of the left hand . 
She was admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring . 
She was maintained on continuous EEG monitoring which showed L sided slowing with polymorphic delta compared with R sided theta but no epileptiform activity . 
She was extubated in the am of [ * * 6 - 4 * * ] and quickly returned to her baseline , able to answer simple questions appropriately and follow basic commands . 
Dilantin level was 1 5 . 4 . 
She received an extra 2 0 0 mg dilantin on [ * * 6 - 4 * * ] and her home dose was increased to 1 0 0 mgQAM / 2 0 0 QPM 5 x / wk rather than 4 x / wk , with 1 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] 2 x / wk . 
Etiology of her seizure is somewhat unclear at this point . 
Infectious w / u has been negative thus far ; it is possible she could have had an underlying low grade viral URI given her recent hx of cough . 
Labs unremarkable except for leukocytosis which is now downtrending . 
The patient was transferred to the floor in good condition . 
The patient was extubated the day after admission and did well over the weekend , however on [ * * 6 - 8 * * ] the patient spiked a temp and was found to have a white count of 1 9 ( see below ) . 
She began having more seizures that responded acutely to ativan . 
She was frequently somnolent following the seizures - which had a unique semiology , including rather purposeful picking at covers and items real and imagined on her bed , waving her hand in the air as if being attacked by flies , and looking off into the corner of the room , often up and to the left . 
She received several boluses of Dilantin and her dose was increased to 3 0 0 mg total daily . 
A steady level was difficult to obtain and she was switched to infatabs that could be crushed and administered via g - tube . 
The patient tolerated this transition well with improved level . 
Her medications and seizures were discussed with her daughter and husband who care for her , as well as her primary doctor who has been managing her dilantin . 
Plan was made to continue at 3 0 0 mg total daily with plans to recheck the level in the week following discharge . 
The patient did generally well through the rest of her hospitalization with a single seizure the day prior to discharge for which she received an extra dose of dilantin with a level up to 1 4 . 4 on discharge . 
UA and CXR were unremarkable . 
Blood cultures were negative . 
She was continued on her home Bactrim for chronic UTI . 
On transfer to the floor she became more somnolent related in part to being post - ictal and also due to a new fever up to 1 0 3 , as well as an elevated WBC count and inflammatory markers . 
A CXR revealed bilateral aspiration pneumonias , likely related to her seizures . 
These were treated with empiric antibiotics with significant clinical improvement withing 3 6 hours . 
A PICC line was placed and Cefepime and Vanco were coursed conitnued for 4 more days following discharge ( ~ 1 0 day course ) . 
She received her medications and tube feeds via her PEG . 
Her temporary PEG tube was replaced by IR aas it had fallen out the week prior and was due to be replaced as an outpatient . 
A foley had been placed there temporarily . 
The patient tolerated the new tube well . 
She was continued on her home antihypertensives . 
CXR was clear . 
Subsequent aspiration PNA as above .

Discharge Instructions : Ms . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 6 9 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 3 9 - 6 - 3 * * ] after a prolonged seizure . 
She was initially admitted to the ICU , , requiring a mechanical respirations while her seizures came under control . 
She was transferred to the floor and had another seizure and subsequently developed bilateral aspiration pneumonias . 
She was treated with IV antibiotics and her Dilantin was increased . 
A large IV was placed for her to get medicine at home and her G - tube was replaced . 
Because we had trouble maintaining an accurate level with her Dilantin we switched to the infatabs and increased her dose to 1 0 0 mg in the morning and 2 0 0 mg in the evening every day . 
Her level the morning of discharge was 1 1 . 2 and she was given an extra 2 0 0 mg , which should bring her level up above 1 5 . 
Next week she should follow up with her primary doctor and get a level drawn . 
The Visiting nurses who will remove her PICC line may be able to do this for you . 
Followup Instructions : With PCP , [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
Vital signs are normal . 
No CVA tenderness . 
Chest x - ray is clear . 
CK is 1 5 5 . 
Troponin is 0 . 1 3 . 
Electrolytes are normal . 
Hematocrit is 3 9 , white count normal . 
Most likely low probability for ischemia . 
As you know , he is a 5 3 - year - old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 0 2 / 1 1 / 6 0 for presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring . 
His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . 
Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of his history of exertional chest pain . 
He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds . 
The test was terminated for 7 / 1 0 substernal chest pain , but no hypotension and no overt EKG changes were noted , so we proceeded with the pacemaker implant . 
Since the implant Mr . Hess describes that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath have vanished , however , he has noticed that he is sleeping less well and occasionally has nocturnal palpitations , which potentially could represent pacing from his pacemaker . 
Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa QQ 6 2 6 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . 
His estimated battery longevity is 8 9 months . 
The atrial impedance is 5 6 9 ohms , the ventricular impedance is 5 2 9 ohms . 
The P - wave is 5 . 6 mV . 
The R - wave is 3 1 . 3 mV . 
The threshold in the atrium is 0 . 7 5 V at 0 . 4 mV , and the threshold in the ventricle is 0 . 7 5 V at 0 . 4 msec . 
In summary , Mr . Hess is doing extremely well after his pacemaker placement . 
His pacemaker incision is extremely well healed . 
There is no sign of erythema or hematoma . 
However , his sinus tachycardia is mildly perplexing . 
Looking at his heart rate histogram , it appears that this sinus rates have varied from 8 0 - 1 2 0 beats per minute for the most part aside from some low heart rate that potentially are nocturnal . 
I have performed some pacing maneuvers today in clinic to attempt to determine whether the mechanism of his current tachycardia is sinus and it appears that this is sinus tachycardia . 
For this reason , I have performed a TSH today , which is normal , however , I suggest to you that potentially a cursory endocrine workup and potentially a repeat echocardiogram at your facility might be indicated . 
I am available to discuss these findings with you at any time . 
I plan to see Mr . Hess in followup in three months ' time , and if any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me . 
As you know , he is a 5 4 - year - old gentleman who underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker on 0 2 / 1 1 / 2 0 6 0 for his presyncope and pauses on Holter monitoring . 
His past medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia , gastroesophageal reflux disease , and asthma . 
Prior to his pacemaker placement , an exercise stress test was performed because of a history of exertional chest pain . 
He was able to exercise for 8 minutes and 4 seconds . 
The test was terminated for 7 / 1 0 substernal chest pain , but no hypotension or overt ECG changes were noted . 
We proceeded to pacemaker implant and Mr . Hess has done well since that time . 
He remarks that his intermittent symptoms of lightheadedness have resolved . 
However , he occasionally still has nocturnal palpitations as well as occasional exertional chest discomfort . 
He tells me that he underwent testing at Wheatland Memorial consisting of a stress test with MIBI imaging that perhaps showed an abnormality , though the report of this test is not available to me today for review . 
Interrogation today of his Medtronic Kappa CTE 2 2 6 pacemaker reveals that his underlying rhythm is sinus tachycardia with intact AV conduction . 
The estimated longevity on the battery life is 9 5 months . 
The atrial impedance is 5 4 4 ohms and the ventricular impedance is 5 1 9 ohms . 
The P - wave in the atrium is 5 . 6 mV and the R - wave in the ventricle is 3 1 mV . 
The threshold in the atrium is stable at 0 . 5 V at 0 . 4 msec , and the threshold in the ventricle is also stable at 0 . 5 V at 0 . 4 msec . 
In summary , the pacemaker appears to be working quite well . 
However , Mr . Hess persists in a perplexing sinus tachycardia that has been present since his last pacemaker interrogation . 
I have therefore ordered an echocardiogram to rule out any ill effects of the sinus tachycardia or any structural heart disease that may be causing the sinus tachycardia . 
In addition , I have performed a 1 2 - lead ECG , which appears to show sinus mechanism rather than an atrial tachycardia . 
Today in the office , his sinus rate is 1 0 9 beats per minute with stable blood pressure . 
Mr . Hess and I have checked thyroid studies in the recent past and those have been unremarkable . 
I have discussed this case with Dr . Quatrell Swanson who has agreed to assist in Cardiology care for Mr . Hess in the near future , since Dr . Law is moving his practice to the NCHC . 
I plan to see Mr . Hess in followup in three months ' time for his pacemaker . 
If any issues arise in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me . 
He is a 5 4 - year - old man with obesity , dyslipidemia and hypertension , S / P dual - chamber pacemaker placement by Dr . Una Trujillo in February , 2 0 6 0 . 
He complained of fatigue and exertional throat tightness and a nuclear stress test in June , 2 0 6 0 , revealed apical ischemia and an ejection fraction of 7 0 percent . 
Cardiac catheterization performed by Dr . Leslie Campbell on 0 8 / 0 4 / 6 0 via the right radial artery revealed a right dominant system , a tight lesion in the proximal LAD , and no other focally occlusive disease . 
He received a 3 mm stent , postdilated to 3 . 5 mm , with an excellent angiographic result . 
He spent an uneventful night without complaints , ambulating and voiding without difficulty . 
His right wrist was stable , and his hand warm and well perfused . 
Morning labs included a BUN of 1 6 , creatinine 0 . 9 , negative cardiac enzymes , hematocrit 3 6 . 4 , platelets 2 3 8 , 0 0 0 , cholesterol 1 8 2 , HDL 3 7 , LDL 9 1 and triglycerides 2 6 9 . 
He was discharged home on aspirin , 3 2 5 mg po qd ; Plavix , 7 5 mg po qd , to be continued for at least six months according to the research trial protocol ; atenolol , 5 0 mg po qd ; Lipitor , 8 0 mg po qd ; Prilosec , 2 0 mg po qd ; Proventil , two puffs qid ; and sublingual nitroglycerin , prn chest pain . 
We ' ve asked him to see you in the next couple of weeks , and to call if he has questions before then . 
He also will follow up with the research staff per protocol guidelines . 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care . 
Please don ' t hesitate to call with questions . 
Unfortunately , we did not connect back in December following the receipt of his lipid data that included a marked and unacceptable LDL elevation . 
We had left a message with his daughter , Lea . 
Additional laboratory data at that time included a hemoglobin A 1 c of 6 . 2 % . 
He is seeking to establish a new relationship with a primary care physician through Barney Convalescent Hospital . 
He has also had problems of at least 2 years duration with erectile dysfunction and decreased libido . 
He apparently ran out of his clopidogrel some time ago and did not renew the prescription . 
It was his understanding that he was to remain on this medication for only six months following the PCI procedure . 
His initial blood pressure 1 4 9 / 9 6 , but then 1 5 0 / 8 2 on repeat , using a large cuff . 
His weight is down 4 pounds to 1 9 3 . 
His venous pressure and carotid upstrokes are normal . 
His lung fields are clear . 
He has no cardiac murmur . 
There are no pulse deficits or peripheral edema . 
His ECG shows a sinus tachycardia ( after rushing into the office ) and an incomplete right bundle - branch block pattern with a normal QRS duration . 
In comparison with his tracing from 1 2 / 2 4 / 2 0 6 0 , his resting heart rate has increased . 
It is possible that the higher dose beta - blocker contributes to his erectile dysfunction , though the problem may have antedated this medication altogether . 
We will refer him to the practice of Dr . Ohara and Dr . Xiao , as well as to Dr . Sutherland , the latter specifically to help us evaluate his longstanding erectile dysfunction . 
He will continue his efforts at weight loss . 
He is working out at the gym 2 - 3 times per week . 
Pt tolerated the procedure well . 
Prior to the ERCP pt was admitted to [ * * Hospital * * ] hospital [ * * 1 - 2 2 * * ] for severe recurrent epigastric pain after eating , lasting hours , in the setting of elevated transaminases ( AST : ALT 3 7 0 : 4 4 7 AP 1 6 6 , TB 4 , lipase 2 2 ) . 
Pt does have history of similar pain just a few days prior as well as approx one year ago which resolved on its own . 
On [ * * 1 - 1 8 * * ] and again on [ * * 1 - 2 2 * * ] pt underwent RUQ U / S which showed cholelithiasis but no evidence of cholecystitis . 
Pt denies fever at any point , but does admit to recent nausea and vomiting . 
Psych : flat affect . 
Impression : Normal major papilla Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free - hand technique . 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification . 
CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree was normal in calibre . 
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge in the distal CBD . 
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 1 2 o ' clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire . 
CBD was sweeped with balloon catheter and sludge was extracted . 
Bilateral heterogeneous opacification in the lungs , worst in the left lower [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 3 6 3 0 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] represent atelectasis ; however , underlying infectious process such as pneumonia or aspiration cannot be completely excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical setting . 
Status post cholecystectomy with percutaneous biliary drain . 
Fat - containing ventral periumbilical hernia and a fluid filled right inguinal hernia . 
Nondiagnostic examination in the evaluation of pulmonary embolism secondary to respiratory motion artifact . 
No evidence of venous clot in the iliac veins or veins of the pelvis . 
Increasing size and number of lymph nodes both in the mediastinum and right inguinal area . 
Clinical correlation recommended to exclude low grade hematologic malignancy . 
Areas of consolidation in bilateral lung bases and in the right upper [ * * Month / Day / Year 3 6 3 0 * * ] may be on the basis of atelectasis , although superimposed infection or central obstructing lesion cannot be excluded based on this examination . 
No clinically useful information was derived . 
If clinically indicated , a radionuclide ventriculogram may be better able to assess biventricular systolic function . 
Brief Hospital Course : He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery Service as a direct admission following ERCP . 
He was given IV hydration and made NPO . 
His LFT ' s and bilirubin were followed closely and slowly trended downward . 
Early discussions took place with patient for operative management with cholecystectomy for which patient wanted to discuss further with team and his family before definitively consenting for this . 
On [ * * 1 - 2 6 * * ] the he underwent a laparoscopic converted to an open cholecystectomy . 
POD # 1 his urinary output dropped and he received fluid along with 1 unit pRBC with adequate urinary response . 
On POD # 2 he was advanced to a regular diet . 
He continued to do well . 
However , overnight he began to drop his O 2 sats and became tachycardic . 
In addition , his Cr rose to 1 . 6 from 0 . 9 the day before . 
A CXR was performed which showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion . 
He was given a dose of Lasix with no response . 
An ABG revealed hypoxemia with pO 2 of 6 5 . 
Given the concern for PE and his ongoing hypoxia , he was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring . 
A CTA chest with PE protocol was unable to be performed because the patient ' s Cr had bumped to 1 . 9 . 
Therefore , a CT torso without contrast was performed which showed a bilateral lower [ * * Month / Day ( 4 ) 3 6 3 0 * * ] opacification ( L > R ) but was otherwise unremarkable . 
BLE duplex U / S was negative for DVT . 
While in the unit , he became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures ranging between 7 0 s - 8 0 s . 
He was empirically started on vanc / zosyn . 
The next day ( [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 2 - 1 * * ] ) , his antibiotics were changed to vanc / Cipro / cefepime to cover hospital acquired pneumonia . 
An NGT was placed with immediate return of 5 0 0 cc of coffee ground fluid ; his HCT was found to be 2 2 . 8 . 
He was transfused 2 units of pRBC ' s . 
GI team was consulted regarding a potential upper endoscopy . 
However , they felt EGD would require elective intubation and therefore the procedure was deferred . 
The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated and his urine output remained adequate . 
The following day his Cr dropped to 1 . 3 and he was sent for a CTA with PE protocol which was indeterminate for PE due to motion artifact but did not show thrombus in the aortoiliac or pelvic veins . 
Serial HCT were trended and remained stable . 
An echo was attempted [ * * 2 - 1 * * ] but the quality was suboptimal secondary to the patient ' s large body habitus . 
He still had a significant supplemental oxygen requirement . 
Over the next few days in the ICU his respiratory status remained tenuous . 
He was started on intermittent Lasix boluses [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 2 - 1 * * ] which resulted in large diuresis and he was able to be weaned to nasal cannula . 
On [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 2 - 2 * * ] , he was started on 2 0 mg PO Lasix daily and was given 4 0 mg IV Lasix as well as a dose of Diamox . 
He again responded with a brisk diuresis but then became hypotensive overnight requiring 2 . 5 L of fluid boluses . 
His HCT in the AM was 2 1 and he was transfused one unit pRBC ' s . 
The patient also developed an urticarial rash on [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 2 - 2 * * ] and this was attributed to having switched his Cipro from IV to PO . 
The Cipro was therefore discontinued and he was started on Levofloxacin . 
His rash has virtually resolved at time of this dictation . 
He remained on the Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for the pneumonia for a total of 7 day course , stop date [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 2 - 1 0 * * ] . 
He is also receiving Flagyl for a presumed C . difficile colitis given his stool volume . 
It should be noted that he has had 2 negative stool for C . Diff cultures . 
His treatment with Flagyl will continue for a total of 7 day course . 
A Flexi seal system was placed rectally for stool containment and protection of patient ' s skin given his large body habitus . 
Cholestyramine was started as well . 
He was also seen by Psychiatry for his anxiety and depression and it was recommended to increase his Celexa to 4 0 mg daily from 3 0 mg and to avoid benzodiazepines as this would put him at risk for delirium .

Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - Independent . 
Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to the hopsital with gallstones and underwent a procedure called an ERCP which looks inside of your biliary system . 
You then had your galbladder removed . 
You did well in the post operative period and your diet was advanced . 
You should avoid fried and / or greasey foods ; food choices should include those that are low in fat . 
You may resume your home medications as prescribed . 
If you have been prescribed an anitibiotic please continue the course as directed . 
Return to the emergency room if your symptoms come back . 
Followup Instructions : Follow up in [ * * 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] weeks in Acute Care Surgery Clinic . 
Please call [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 6 0 0 * * ] for an appointment . 
Follow up with your primary care providers as directed . 
Pt is a very poor historian , so most of the history is obtained through chart review and ED providers . 
The patient stated that he had the ERCP done , returned home , felt really fatigued and unable to walk ( [ * * 3 - 7 * * ] leg pain and weakness ) . 
His wife called 9 1 1 and he was taken to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED . 
Denied any chest pain , abd pain , nausea , vomiting . 
No headaches . 
No LOC , no h / o syncope . 
Patient had second , outpatient ERCP by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] the day prior to admission due to increasing pruritis and a CT at [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] that suggesting tumor ingrowth into the stent . 
He was pretreated with ampicillin 2 gm IV , and gentamicin 8 0 mg IV . 
ERCP demonstrated a malignant - appearing biliary stricture affecting the hilumand right and left ducts . 
There was debris visible with in the stent at early cholangiogram . 
Occulsion cholangiograqm revealed extensive stricturing of both left and right intrahepatic ducts . 
Although a small left intrahepatic radical opacified , it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter in this direction . 
For this reason , no stent could be introduced . 
Balloon sweeps were performed from just above the stent and down through the stent , and a moderate amount of debris was removed . 
Even after multiple sweeps , there was some filling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent , consistent with a degree of tumor ingrowth . 
Sticture not amenable to ERCP , and suggested PTCA as next intervention if futher obstructive symptoms occur . 
He was NOT discharged on any anti - biotic ppx .

Trimethoprim / Sulfa sensitivity testing available on request . 
IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED FROM AEROBIC BOTTLE . 
EKG : Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing . 
No previous tracing available for comparison . 
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST : There are mild dependent changes at the lung bases . 
A biliary stent is noted in the common duct . 
Moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is noted . 
Near the porta hepatis and adjacent to the proximal end of the biliary stent is an approximately 5 . 7 x 3 . 7 - cm area of hypodensity of the hepatic parenchyma with ill - defined borders . 
Multiple smaller satellite low - attenuation hepatic foci with similar ill - defined appearance are noted . 
There is associated moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation . 
There is no defined fluid collection and no subcapsular or perihepatic fluid . 
There is no ascites or intraperitoneal focal fluid collection or abscess . 
The pancreas , spleen , adrenal glands , stomach and bowel are unremarkable . 
At the upper pole of the right kidney is a 3 . 1 - cm exophytic lesion which measures 2 8 Hounsfield units , higher than expected for a simple cyst . 
Smaller bilateral parapelvic cysts are noted . 
There are bilateral extrarenal pelves . 
There is no pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy . 
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST : The rectum , urinary bladder and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable . 
The prostate is mildly enlarged . 
There is no free pelvic fluid or lymphadenopathy . 
BONE WINDOWS : No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions are identified . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
These findings are thought more likely to represent primary cholangiocarcinoma with intrahepatic metastases . 
The possibility of superinfection cannot be definitively excluded . 
Evaluation with ultrasound could be helpful to determine if there is a fluid component . 
If so , this could be aspirated for diagnostic purposes . 
Bilateral parapelvic renal cysts . 
Ultrasound is suggested to determine if this is a cyst or possibly a solid lesion . 
RUQ ULTRASOUND : FINDINGS : There is mild edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with liver disease . 
The gallbladder is relaxed and no pericholecystic fluid is identified to suggest cholecystitis . 
As noted on prior CT , there is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation . 
Upper pole cyst is identified on the right kidney measuring 3 . 1 cm x 3 cm x 2 . 1 cm . 
No fluid collections around the liver or gallbladder are identified . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No fluid collections identified in or around the liver or gallbladder . 
Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation also noted on CT one day previous . 
Edema within the gallbladder wall which may be seen with liver disease . 
No evidence of acute cholecystitis identified . 
AP CXR : Heart size top normal . 
Lungs clear . 
No edema or pleural effusion . 
Fullness in the mediastinum at the thoracic inlet to the right of midline could be due to goiter or tortuous head and neck vessels . 
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements . 
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion . 
HEAD CT W / O CONTRAST : FINDINGS : No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage . 
There is no shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus . 
Several areas of relative [ * * Name ( NI ) 3 3 2 1 4 * * ] is seen within vessels , including the MCAs and vertebrals , possibly secondary to recent contrast administration . 
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated . 
IMPRESSION : No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage . 
MRI with diffusion - weighted images is more sensitive in the evaluation for acute ischemia / infarct and for vascular detail . 
Brief Hospital Course : 1 ) Gram negative septicemia due to cholangitis : Bacteremia may have been secondary to manipulation during ERCP . 
RUQ ultrasound showed no evidence of cholecystitis . 
Culture grew enterobacter . 
Patient received ampicillin and gentamicin while in house and was discharged on po cipro . 
Surveillance blood cultures remain negative . 
Plan for total of 1 4 days of antibiotics . 
Patient is hemodynamically stable . 
LFTs are steadily improving . 
Percutaneous biliary drain was discussed but was not necessary given bili trending down with the cleaning of the stent done on initial ERCP . 
VT noted but did not temporally correlate with patient ' s episode . 
More likely this was due to transient hypotension in the setting of his sepsis . 
However , could certainly consider AICD once bacteremia completely treated given concurrent low EF ( EF 2 0 - 3 0 % ) . 
However , patient is in hospice and likely would refuse . 
This was not discussed during his inhospital course . 
Neuro exam was normal and head CT was negative . 
Orthostatics were negative . 
No significant arrhythmias on tele other than a transient tachycardia EP believes was possibly afib / flutter , ventricularly paced . 
Consider follow - up ultrasound to better characterize , as recommended , if patient agreeable . 
He denied any chest pain . 
His statin was held due to bump in LFTs . 
Could consider restarting at follow - up but likely little benefit given overall prognosis and patient will continue to be at risk of recurrent transaminitis . 
Likely prerenal . 
Please resume diovan at follow - up visit if creatinine and blood pressure remain stable .

Followup Instructions : Please follow - up with your primary care doctor , Dr . [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 6 1 6 4 * * ] , on Monday , [ * * 2 1 2 7 - 4 - 2 8 * * ] at 4 : 3 0 PM to follow - up this hospital admission . 
Patient presented to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] about 1 month ago with increased creatinine to 3 ( from 1 . 6 ) . 
A workup including renal biopsy revealed pauci - immune P - ANCA positive glomerulonephritis thought secondary to hydralazine . 
She was started on prednisone and cyclophosphamide at that point . 
In addition , according to the patient and records from [ * * Hospital * * ] she was also recently admitted to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] after a collapse one month ago . 
She was brought in and found to have AF with RVR . 
Was started on dilt and metoprolol with reportedly good control . 
Further workup there included an EGD and colonoscopy which revealed gastric ulcers and polyps as well as candidiasis . 
She received 2 units pRBCs and her hct came up to 3 0 . 
While there she was noted to be neutropenic . 
They thought this was possibly medication related . 
Cyclophosphamide , bactrim , and fluconazole were discontinued . 
She completed a course of caspofungin and a TTE was negative for vegetations . 
Her WBC count came up . 
She was discharged to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] . 
Today was feeling weak and tired and then had 3 episodes of BRBPR so decided to come to Ed . 
Presented to ED in AF with RVR to 1 6 0 s . 
Received 1 0 mg Iv Dilt with improvement in rate to high 9 0 s / 1 0 0 . 
Received then 3 0 mg PO dilt . 
Stable HRs since . 
Also received 5 mg IV metoprolol . 
Initial VS : 9 7 . 8 1 3 7 AF 1 1 1 / 7 8 1 6 9 9 . 
No N / V / Abd pain . 
Just feels tired . 
Rectal exam revealed guaiac positive dark stool . 
Received IVF and 4 0 mg IV protonix . 
Hct in ED is 2 7 consistent with baseline ( 2 5 - 3 0 ) here at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
Were going to do NGL but decided not to because didn ' t want her to go back into AF with RVR . 
GI called in Ed and will see her on the floor . 
On the floor , patient complained of being sick of being in the hospital and dry mouth . 
Otherwise densies fevers , chills , abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , nausea , and vomiting . 
Has had some weight loss worked up in the past and possibly related to depression ( per the patient ) after her friend died recently . 
Complained of occasional flank pain at biopsy site and a developing bed sore . 
Rest of ROS negative including no CP , palps , sob , dysuria . 
NG lavage was negative which was reassuring . 
She was given 2 u pRBC with stable blood counts and hemodynamics . 
She had an EGD on [ * * 4 - 1 3 * * ] without e / o active bleeding . 
Per GI likely LGIB and will need c - scope sometime during this admission . 
She was also given 2 u FFP given coagulopathy and concern for GIB and need for endoscopy . 
Bleeding ceased , however , colonoscopy deferred secondary to difficult to control AFib with RVR . 
She should follow - up as an outpatient for colonscopy . 
She was noted to have AF with RVR to 1 4 0 s . 
Initially felt to be worsened by volume depletion with GIB . 
However , despite blood products , she remained tachycardic and thus nodal agents were resumed . 
Anticoagulation was held in acute setting , with coagulopathy reversed in the setting of GIB . 
She was uptitrated on her PO regimen to Metoprolol 5 0 mg TID and Diltiazem 3 0 mg QID which kept her HR in reasonable control until she underwent a bowel prep for her colonoscopy . 
On the morning of the scheduled colonoscopy , she developed AFib with RVR in the setting of dehydration evidence by alkalosis and hypernatremia . 
She received agressive IV hydration and multiple IV medications to help control rate . 
Her heart rate initially responded and stabilized in the 9 0 - 1 0 0 ' s . 
However , the following evening , she required another bowel prep and her heart rate escalated to the 1 5 0 ' s . 
She received additional IV nodal agents and her PO regimen was increased . 
An electrophysiology consult was obtained and the recommendation was for rate control and uptitration with her current medications . 
Rhythm control was deferred . 
She was restarted on anti - coagulation on HD # 5 with a heparin gtt . 
A TEE showed no evidence of thrombus . 
A cardioversion was attempted and was unsuccessful . 
The patient was loaded with amiodarone and the Metoprolol was uptitrated to 1 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] to achieve adequate rate control . 
She was started on Diltiazem which was uptitrated to 4 5 mg PO QID . 
HR was in the 8 0 s on discharge . 
Her coumadin was re - started and heparin gtt was continued until the INR was therapeutic . 
Her INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held on discharge . 
She should follow - up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] as an outpatient . 
She should have INR checked in 2 days and coumadin restarted . 
If her Amiodarone converts her to sinus rhythm or drops her heart rate as she becomes therapeutic , she may need to stop her Metoprolol . 
The patient was diuresed adequately with Lasix and symptoms improved . 
The patient was weaned off supplemental oxygen and was staturating 9 5 % on RA . 
Her creatinine bumped and Lasix was stopped . 
Her peak creatinine was 2 . 8 on [ * * 2 1 8 2 - 4 - 2 1 * * ] and came down to 2 . 5 on [ * * 2 1 8 2 - 4 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Lasix can be considered as an outpatient if she develops signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure . 
Per renal , taper prednsione to 4 0 mg and then to 3 0 mg . 
She remained on prednisone 3 omg Daily and her creatinine remained stable . 
Her steroid ppx including PCP [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) * * ] , PPI , calcium , vit D were continued . 
She was followed by the renal consult service during her admission and Lasix was held when Creatinine was elevated .

Pt was initially treated in the ICU , where she developed a LLL PNA , treated with Augmentin and Flagyl . 
She also developed jaundice to propofol and was sedated instead with versed . 
She initally failed swallow eval and had an NG tube which remained until [ * * 2 1 3 3 - 6 - 1 5 * * ] when she pulled it out , however , susbequent repeat swallow eval suggested she could tolerate oral nutrition . 
Pt ' s BP originally controlled with labetalol gtt , but then placed on oral regimen of labetalol , lisinopril , and HCTZ . 
Systolic BP ' s are running 1 3 0 - 1 8 0 , and titration of her BP meds is ongoing . 
Symptomatically , she showed significant improvement , becoming drowsy with improved HA and nausea . 
Eye movements continued to improve , although on discharge she still has some dysconjugate gaze , giving her what appears as a partial one - and - a - half syndrome .

Pt called Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 1 0 7 5 * * ] of ID with report of feeling dizzy with black stool , and was referred to the ED . 
In the ED she initially vomited dark material but this progressed to bright red emesis . 
In the ED , vital signs were 9 8 . 4 1 2 5 1 1 1 / 5 1 2 2 1 0 0 % . 
EKG had shown sinus tachycardia . 
She was given 2 PIVs , 1 upRBCs , 3 L IVF , and Protonix 4 0 IV x 1 , then transferred to the MICU . 
Pt has a history of viral illness and tylenol / ibuprofen use of unknown amount . 
She has a history of prior EGD [ * * 4 - 7 * * ] that showed esophagitis . 
Contracted via heterosexual activity . 
CD 4 4 8 8 , VL > 4 8 as of [ * * 7 - 8 * * ] . 
Low limb lead voltage . 
Since the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 0 2 - 9 - 2 6 * * ] limb lead voltage is lower . 
Right CP angle is excluded thus limiting evaluation . 
Evaluation is also limited by underpenetrated technique . 
The lungs appear clear bilaterally . 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable . 
Osseous structures appear intact . 
Left AC joint hypertrophic changes are noted . 
IMPRESSION : Limited study without evidence of acute process . 
Right CP angle exclusion limits evaluation . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 1 2 - 1 2 - 8 * * ] There are relatively low inspiratory volumes on this examination . 
Right - sided IJ central venous catheter remains present , with the tip difficult to visualize but probably at the cavoatrial junction . 
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged . 
Allowing for low inspiratory volume , no gross pulmonary consolidation is seen . 
Osseous structures remain unchanged and grossly unremarkable aside from mild degenerative changes at the right acromioclavicular joint . 
IMPRESSION : Low inspiratory volumes ; no appreciable interval change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease . 
Brief Hospital Course : # . 
GIB : Hematemesis has been consistent with an upper GI source . 
Patient was transferred to the ICU from ED intubated for airway protection and underwent emergent EGD , with clot in fundus that was not unroofed , but no other sources of bleeding . 
Patient then underwent placement of a Right Internal Jugular central line and received a total of 3 units of blood for a hematocrit which nadered at 2 6 . 
She was initially started on a protonix drip which was changed to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] dosing of 4 0 mg after her HCT was stable . 
She was extubated on ICU day 2 and remained somewhat confused and disoriented . 
This was thought to be related to the Benzodiazepines administered for sedation . 
She underwent a second EGD by GI , which found flat lesions and an ulcer in the cardia treated with epinepherine and gold probe . 
She also had some evidence of esophagitis . 
On the third ICU day , patient remained somewhat confused , but was otherwise hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor .

Wet Read : MXAk FRI [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] 1 0 : 5 3 AM Unchanged right parenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the right lateral ventricle , the frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] of left lateral ventricle , and the third ventricle . 
These findings were discussed with Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] at 9 : 4 5 on [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] . 
Final Report INDICATION : Interval evaluation of known parenchymal hemorrhage . 
COMPARISON : Outside hospital CT from [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] at 6 : 4 1 a . m . 
TECHNIQUE : Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without intravenous contrast . 
Multiplanar reformatted images were prepared . 
FINDINGS : Again visualized is an unchanged 2 . 7 x 1 . 7 cm right basal ganglia parenchymal hemorrhage extending into the right lateral ventricle as well as the frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] of the left lateral ventricle and the third ventricle . 
A thin surrounding rim of edema is again noted . 
There is no shift of the normally midline structures . 
There are no new foci of hemorrhage , infarctions , mass effects , or herniation . 
No fractures are identified . 
The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses , mastoid air cells , and middle ear cavities are clear . 
IMPRESSION : Unchanged right basal ganglia hemorrhage extension into the right lateral ventricle , frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] of the left lateral ventricle and the third ventricle . 
Location and imaging features favor hypertensive hemorrhage , although CT cannot entirely exclude underlying vascular malformation or mass . 
These findings were discussed with Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] at 9 : 4 5 on [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 1 - 2 7 * * ] . 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist . 
Provisional Findings Impression : DLrc SAT [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 2 - 5 * * ] 9 : 4 9 PM Slight interval decrease in size of right basal ganglia hemorrhage with little change in known intraventricular extension . 
Stable size of the ventricular system . 
Final Report INDICATION : Patient is a 5 2 - year - old male with known intraventricular , intraparenchymal hemorrhage with worsening mental status . 
Evaluate for interval change . 
EXAMINATION : CT of the head without intravenous contrast . 
COMPARISONS : [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 2 - 2 * * ] . 
TECHNIQUE : Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain . 
No intravenous contrast was administered . 
Multiple sequences were attempted secondary to patient motion . 
This area of hemorrhage is centered in the right basal ganglia and demonstrates extension into the right lateral ventricle . 
Overall , there has been slight interval decrease in hemorrhage filling the right lateral ventricle extending into the right frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] . 
The ventricular system is stable in size and configuration , with the third ventricle measuring up to 7 mm and the right lateral ventricle measuring up to 1 0 mm . 
There are no new foci of hemorrhage . 
There is no evidence of shift of midline structures or transtentorial or uncal herniation . 
The [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 5 2 * * ] - white matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence of acute territorial infarction . 
The bony structures are unremarkable . 
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated . 
IMPRESSION : Slight interval decrease in size of right basal ganglia hemorrhage with little change in known intraventricular extension . 
Stable size of the ventricular system . 
As mentioned earlier , while this can relate to HTN , underlying vascular / neoplastic cause cannot be excluded and work up accdgly . 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist . 
The size of his bleed , the need for frequent neuro checks , and his need for antihypertensives via continuous drip necessitate ICU admission . 
His Left - sided sensory symptoms were well - explained by his Right - thalamic bleed , and there were no symptoms that were unexplained by this lesion . 
Although we do not have records of his blood pressure at the time of EMS contact , the presumptive etiology of this hemorrhagic infarct is uncontrolled hypertension . 
Renal consult was called re . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was transferred to the floor after several days in the ICU . 
Continued issues were blood glucose control ( managed with insulin sliding - scale ) and acute renal failure ( initially ~ 2 . 0 and steady , but then up to 2 . 7 in the setting of UTI and Cipro Tx , all above a reported baseline CKD / Cr 1 . 5 ) , despite IVF and holding the patient ' s previous indomethacin . 
On the floor , he became more confused and febrile , and was found to have a gram - negative UTI . 
Initially , he was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin , but this worsened his renal failure , and the patient became febrile and somnolent / lethargic , so he was switched to IV vancomycin and Zosyn ( vancomycin was discontinued [ * * 1 2 - 7 * * ] after UCx from [ * * 1 2 - 5 * * ] showed gram - positive bacteria ) . 
This UCx ultimately speciated a pan - sensitive [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 8 8 1 1 9 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] on [ * * 1 2 - 8 * * ] ( day of discharge ) after 3 . 5 d of treatment with IV Zosyn , he was switched to PO Bactrim , plan to finish a 7 - 8 d course for complicated ( male ) UTI . 
Fever defervesced rapidly and mental status improved markedly 1 - 2 d after starting IV antibiotics , and creatinine began improving after it peaked at 2 . 7 the day before discharge ( down to 2 . 5 on [ * * 1 2 - 8 * * ] ) . 
Blood cultures and a repeat UCx on [ * * 1 2 - 5 * * ] ( after first dose of Cipro ) have remained no growth to date . 
On the day of discharge , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was alert and oriented to place and date , with stable and normal VS . 
Breathing comfortably and BP in good control on current medication regimen , HDS . 
On Neurologic examination , his speech was fluent and he exhibited a stable mild flattening of his Left NLF , but full power in all tested muscle groups . 
He is working with PT and getting out of bed to chair [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
His FSBG were in good control ( 1 2 0 - 1 5 0 ) on increased dosing of SSI . 
PO DAILY ( Daily ) as needed for constipation . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
This caused the neurologic symptoms ( sensations , mild weakness ) that you experienced . 
This was caused by your high blood pressure along with your diabetes , which need to be kept in better control to prevent future strokes . 
Your kidneys , which were already chronically damaged , were also injured , at least in part due to the painkiller medicines ( indomethacin and naprosyn ) that you were taking every day . 
This was also related to a urinary tract infection you developed here in the hospital , which is being treated by antibiotic medication that will continue for 3 more days .

Brief Hospital Course : 8 7 yo woman with history of coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , presenting with diaphoresis , melana , and found to have upper GI bleed . 
During her hospitalization , the following problems were addressed : . 
Emergent EGD was done in the MICU showing an ulcer at the GE junction , but it was too obscured by blood for further investigation . 
She was monitored overnight in the MICU and then transferred to the floor .

The patient has past history of dramatic hct drop off epo . 
She received 1 x dose of tordol during ED visit on Monday . 
No other NSAID use or history of GERD . 
Most recent colonscopy in [ * * 2 1 4 6 * * ] demonstrated multiple polyps . 
Follow up colonoscopy deferred given NSCLC . 
Initially no evidence of acute bleed , guaic negative stool in the ED prior to transfer , however on the morning of admission the patient passed four melanolic stool , guaic positive . 
Her hct dropped to 2 2 , she was transfused 1 unit of pRBC and given desmopressin . 
Two PIVs were placed , she was started on PPI gtt and 1 more unit pRBC and transferred to MICU for EDG and further management . 
EGD revealed multiple gastric ulcers in antrum , one of which had stigmata of recent bleed with overlying dark area . 
This area was injected . 
There was no evidence of active bleeding . 
The duodenal bulb was acutely inflammed and edematous w / o discrete ulcer or bleeding . 
Patient received additional 2 units pRBCS after procedure , with subsequent stabilization in HCT and hemodynamics .

Peripheral blood morphological review shows high white counts , blasts with high N : C ratio , irregular nuclear contours , very sparse granules . 
No Auer rods seen . 
Given the absence of HLA - DR [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] CD 3 4 , while the morphology does not support it , the flow profile does not rule out acute promyelocytic leukemia . 
Correlation with cytogenetics and FISH is recommended . 
CT CHEST W / CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [ * * 2 2 0 0 - 6 - 2 4 * * ] IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Findings most consistent with typhlitis / neutropenic colitis , given patient ' s history . 
A small nearby nodule can also be reassessed at that time . 
Infectious etiologies could be considered or the nodule may incidental , though substantial in size ; it would be an unlikely presentation of leukemia . 
Right middle lobe tree - in - [ * * Male First Name ( un ) 2 3 9 * * ] process may represent early infection / inflammation . 
Small hypodensities bilateral renal cortices , too small to characterize fully . 
CT CHEST W / CONTRAST CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [ * * 2 2 0 0 - 7 - 1 * * ] IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Persistent cecitis and ascending colitis with persistent and perhaps slightly increased wall thickening and also greater inflammatory fat stranding . 
The appearance suggests neutropenic colitis given the patient ' s history . 
Left lower lobe pulmonary nodule , increased in the short one - week interval since the prior study , worrisome for an ongoing infectious etiology . 
Given lab findings , with elevated WBC count to 2 5 7 K with 9 8 % blasts , found to have likely acute myelomonocytic leukemia , course of 7 + 3 chemotherapy complicated by stroke , typhlitis , neutropenic fever , and likely fungal lung infection . 
She was admitted to the ICU for emergent pheresis . 
In the [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 1 5 3 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] IJ central line catheter was placed for pheresis given her WBC of 2 5 7 and risk for leukostasis . 
After pheresis , her WBC count dropped to 1 2 7 . 
She was also started on hydroxyurea , allopurinol , and emperic cefepime for chemo . 
After some discussions with the family she agreed to chemotherapy and was transfered to BMT service for further management . 
She underwent 7 + 3 cytarabine & idarubicin , course was complicated by ischemic CVA on [ * * 6 - 1 8 * * ] found to have PFO & no obvious source of thrombus , neutropenic colitis ( [ * * 2 1 9 8 - 6 - 2 3 * * ] ) , likely fungal lung infection and neutropenic fever as discussed below . 
After coming out of her nadir , patient had leukocytosis to 2 0 - 3 0 k , peripheral smear and flow showed mature monocytes , possibly consistent with myelodysplasia or robust recovery , less likely recurrence of leukemia or infection . 
Bone marrow biopsy was not done for evidence of remission as patient does not wish to have further chemotherapy , regardless of potential result . 
Pt on broad spectrum abx coverage with [ * * Last Name ( un ) 2 8 3 0 * * ] / vanco . 
CT chest / abd found new nodule in LLL that was increasing in size suggesting infectious process . 
Sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus . 
ENT was consulted and swab culture of the sinus was unrevealing . 
Before being transferred to the ICU for the second time during this admission , she also developed hypotension with SBP in 8 0 s after receving ambisome . 
She responded to fluid boluses and did not require pressor support . 
At time , the hypotension was consider to be mult - factorial including side - effect of ambisome as well as underlying infection . 
Cultures were negative . 
Pt was continued on broad spectrum abx coverage . 
A CT chest / abd ( [ * * 7 - 1 * * ] ) found enlarging nodule in LLL , and sinus CT found possible involvement of the right maxillary sinus with oral - antral fistula . 
ID consult also followed patient during this admission . 
Now ambulating better since starting PT . 
Pt will continue to benefit from acute PT . 
Concern was for leukemia cutis or fungal or drug rash . 
Dermatology was consulted and believed the rash was dependent erythema with early miliaria from recent fevers , biopsy showed likely drug hypersensitivity reaction . 
Rash resolved with removal of meropenem from regimen .

You tolerated the chemotherapy well and your blood counts dropped as expected . 
You also experienced a stroke which resulted in a left facial droop and left arm weakness . 
A work - up for the cause of the stroke revealed that you have a patent foramen ovale , which is a hole between two [ * * Doctor Last Name 1 7 5 4 * * ] of your heart . 
In addition you also developed neutropenic colitis which means that the wall of your large intestines was inflammed which is a complication of receiving chemotherpy . 
We put you on appropriate antibiotics to prevent an infection , rested your bowels , and provide you nutrition via an IV line . 
In addition you also developed a rash which was a side effect of the antibioitics you were taking . 
Your nutritional status improved as did the infection in your bowels by the time you were discharged .

Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without signs of acute diverticulitis . 
No CTA signs of active bleeding within the small or large bowel lumen , though limited evaluation in the bowel loops in the pelvis due to streak artifact from adjacent right hip total arthroplasty . 
Stable bilateral pleural effusions , large on the right and moderate on the left . 
Focal enhancement in the posterior spleen on delayed phase images , possible hemangioma or AV malformation . 
Brief Hospital Course : [ * * Age over 9 0 * * ] year old male with a pmh of a - fib and dCHF on coumadin and aspirin who presented with a lower GI bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR . 
Source is most likely lower given BRBPR mixed with stool . 
However , his BUN / Cr ratio was elevated , though this relationship has been present in historical blood draws . 
He was given FFP and 1 0 mg Vitamin K in the ED and subsequently sent to the MICU . 
He had a maroon bowel movement x 1 in the MICU and received 2 units PRBCs with an appropriate increase . 
CTA showed diverticulosis with no signs of active bleeding . 
His vitals and hematocrit remained stable , no further episodes of bloody bowel movements . 
The patient was offered colonoscopy , however upon discussion with his son , he decided that he would rather not undergo the procedure . 
Given that he was medically stable and his bleed was likely due to diverticulosis in the setting of supratherapeutic INR , this seemed a perfectly reasonable choice . 
He was warned , however , that the CTA could not adequately rule out other sources of bleeding such as AVM or new malignancy that has evolved since last colonoscopy in [ * * 2 1 7 8 * * ] ( though this is unlikely ) . 
He should follow up with his PCP as an outpatient to have hematocrit checked and ensure that he is no longer having blood in his BMs . 
Atrial fibrillation : Has a history of a - fib , and has been on coumadin since [ * * 2 1 8 5 * * ] ( CHADS 2 score is 2 ) . 
Mildly supratherapeutic INR to 3 . 6 in ED . 
In setting of LGIB , INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP . 
Coumadin held while inpatient , continued rate control w metoprolol . 
The patient was instructed to not restart the coumadin until his follow up with PCP , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) 3 * * ] he will need to discuss with him the risks / benefits of continuing coumadin in the the setting of GI bleed . 
Given GI bleed , lasix , lisinopril ( recently DC ' d ) and metoprolol were initially held . 
Metoprolol restarted at half dose , lasix and lisinopril were not restarted on discharge . 
Defer decision on restarting to PCP . 
Because his INR was reversed and coumadin stopped , he will need heparin bridging if he is to restart therapy . 
Vitamin C 5 0 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO once a day . 
Colace 1 0 0 mg Capsule Sig : One ( 1 ) Capsule PO twice a day . 
Tums 2 0 0 mg calcium ( 5 0 0 mg ) Tablet , Chewable Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet , Chewable PO three times a day . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid ( walker or cane ) . 
You required transfusions of blood and blood products . 
You had a high INR - or coumadin level . 
We believe that this INR contributed to the bleeding but the [ * * Last Name * * ] problem was likely in the colon , possibly diverticulosis . 
We discussed the risks and benefits of a colonoscopy and ultimately you decided to discuss this with your regular doctors . 
Moving forward , we ask you to do the following : 1 . 
STOP Coumadin 2 . 
STOP Lisinopril 3 . 
REDUCE the dose of your Metoprolol to a HALF pill twice daily ( 1 2 . 5 mg ) 4 . 
You will be reconnected with your primary care physician after this visit . 
He was golfing at the time , and suddenly developed weakness with no sensory changes . 
The weakness involved the face , arm and leg on the left side only . 
He went to Gilmore Hospital , where they checked his blood pressure , and found it to be 2 2 0 / 1 4 0 ( per his report ) . 
A CT scan was performed , and he was informed that it was normal . 
He became frustrated with the ER there and signed out AMA . 
He went to the HCH at Easton 2 days later , his BP was still elevated , and they started him on clonidine . 
They attempted to arrange for a renal angiogram to work up his hypertension , but he declined . 
No further stroke / TIA workup was performed . 
He comes to me for a second opinion regarding his workup . 
His weakness has greatly improved , but not back to normal . 
He has never had sensory changes , and no speech difficulties , anosognosia , neglect , or gait instability . 
He did have " flashing lights in both eyes " for fifteen minutes at the onset of the symptoms on the golf course , but none since then . 
He has never had transient monocular blindness , diplopia , or suddenly blurry vision . 
He is being worked up for possible renal artery stenosis . 
He has not had his cholesterol checked .

I have counseled him that most likely the best treatment for this type of stroke is to control his hypertension , and to use antiplatelet agents . 
I have asked that he increase his dose of ASA to 3 2 5 mg per day . 
In addition , he needs a work up . 
I have arranged for him to have CNIS , 2 4 hour Holter monitoring , and TTE with bubble study . 
Additionally , we should check fasting lipids . 
He wishes to have a PCP at FPC , and I have requested that he have the next available appointment with Dr . Harry Tolliver of the cardiology department , who could also be instrumental in adjusting his hypertension meds . 
He will return to clinic in 2 - 3 months , and is to page me immediately with any new symptoms or concerns . 
I last saw him on 1 0 / 1 / 2 1 3 2 , and he has continued to improvesince that time . 
He remains on ASA 3 2 5 mg po qd for stroke prevention , and continues to be worked up for renovascular hypertension . 
He has had no new stroke - like symptoms , and only very infrequently feels that the right leg is weak , usually at the end of the day when he is fatigued . 
He was recently seen by Dr . Harry Tolliver of the department of Cardiology . 
He underwent a 2 4 - hour holter monitor , which showed no evidence for atrial fibrillation or other significant dysrhythmia . 
His CNIS have no evidence for disease . 
He is to go for his TTE with bubble study later today . 
Speech fluent , non - dysarthric . 
EOM ' s full , no nystagmus . 
Face symmetric , full power x 4 .

We are likely left with small vessel disease causing a lacune in the internal capsule . 
The best for of treatment would be continued antiplatelet therapy with the ASA 3 2 5 mg per day , and continued treatment for his hypertension , as per Dr . Tolliver . 
I will see him again in 3 months time , and he will call me in the interim with any problems or questions . 
HISTORY : Mr . Slater is a delightful and active 8 0 - year - old man who was incidentally found to have a renal mass in 2 1 3 3 . 
At that time Dr . Updike performed a left partial nephrectomy , and the final pathology showed a 1 . 5 cm clear cell renal cell carcinoma . 
Since that date he has remained well with no clinical evidence of recurrent disease and has had interval CT scans . 
For the last 2 years , enhancing nodules have been noted within the region of the partial nephrectomy . 
A biopsy performed approximately 1 year ago did not demonstrate any cancer within modestly enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes . 
CT scan was repeated in December of 2 1 3 7 . 
This again showed some enlarged retroperitoneal adenopathy and also enlargement of the soft tissue nodules . 
Biopsy in March of this year showed probable recurrent renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type within the nodules . 
Biopsy of an adjacent adrenal gland showed no cancer . 
His metastatic workup has included CT scans of the chest , which have demonstrated small pulmonary nodules of uncertain significance . 
He has met with Drs . 
Eagle and Yzaguirre . 
Both have recommended completion of the nephrectomy and resection of any visible tumor , perhaps with intraoperative radiation as well . 
Hypertension . 
CVA with residual weakness on the right side . 
He is , however , still able to walk with a cane . 
High cholesterol . 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS : Atenolol , hydrochlorothiazide , lisinopril , Norvasc , Avapro , clonidine , Lipitor , and allopurinol .

He last smoked in 2 1 3 2 . 
He is a widow and came today to the appointment with 1 of his daughters . 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS : No respiratory symptoms suggesting progressive pulmonary metastases , no abdominal or GI symptoms . 
PHYSICAL EXAM : No anemia , jaundice , cyanosis , or clubbing No gynecomastia Respiration comfortable Mild right - sided motor weakness , walks with a cane . 
No hernias . 
RADIOLOGY : CT scans demonstrate multiple soft tissue nodules within the partial nephrectomy bed , the largest being 1 5 mm across . 
He also has prominent lymph nodes within the retroperitoneum , the largest of which is 1 4 mm , and an enlarged left common iliac lymph node of 1 8 mm . 
Chest CT shows scattered 2 mm nodules of uncertain significance . 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN : Confirmed local recurrence of renal cell cancer - for completion nephrectomy and resection of tumor bed . 
Lymph nodes will be also be sampled . 
For intraoperative radiation if appropriate and possibly adjuvant radiation to follow . 
Consent obtained today . 
His dermatologist started prednisone ( 6 0 mg daily ) three weeks ago for a pemphigiod flair . 
Mr Slater & # 8 2 1 7 ; s sugars were initially well controlled off insulin , but a week and a half ago he began to develop lower extremity edema , DOE , and general fatigue . 
He began to taper the prednisone ( to 4 0 mg daily ) and then stopped them altogether yesterday . 
He presented to the FPC ED complaining of fatigue and weakness and was found to have a FSBG & gt ; 5 0 0 .

Repeat labs showed Glu 4 7 9 w / partial resolution of other electrolyte abnormalities . 
He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management . 
On arrival to the floor , he reports feeling tired , but that his weakness and fatigue have improved since he arrived in the ED . 
He continues to have LE edema , which has worsened in the last day . 
He denies recent weight loss , fevers , cough , dyspnea or PND , syncope , N / V , diarrhea , constipation , melena , urinary symptoms , joint pain , bruising , worsening rash , skin lesions , double vision , dysarthria , headache , or focal weakness or numbness .

He reports developing BRBPR 8 - 9 months ago after starting pradaxa for afib . 
It remained stable , but over the past 4 - 5 days there has been increasing blood and rectal pain along with hematuria and dysuria . 
He reports this was in the setting of cold symptoms . 
He denies melena , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting . 
He had some mild shortness of breath and fatigue yesterday and today , but no CP . 
In the ED , initial VS were ED 9 7 . 2 5 7 8 2 / 5 8 1 6 9 6 % , and he triggered for hypotension . 
EKG showed sinus 6 0 na ni qtc 4 9 6 . 
WBC was 2 0 . 6 and Hct was 3 7 . 7 . 
INR was 1 . 3 . 
Cr was 2 . 0 but improved to 1 . 5 . 
Lactate 1 . 7 . 
UA showed 1 0 8 wbc and many bacteria . 
He had a CT a / p which showed cystitis but no major bleed . 
He received cipro / flagyl . 
He did not receive blood . 
He was seen by GI who felt that he may warrant a colonoscopy initially , but decided given his stable picture to defer for now . 
On arrival to the MICU , he is comfortable and without any complaints . 
Denies cough , shortness of breath , or wheezing . 
Denies chest pain , chest pressure , palpitations , or weakness . 
Denies nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , constipation , abdominal pain . 
Denies rashes or skin changes . 
No hx of withdrawals . 
MMM , oropharynx clear , EOMI , PERRL Neck : supple , JVP not elevated , no LAD CV : Regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 + S 2 , no murmurs , rubs , gallops Lungs : diffuse wheezes .

Compared to prior , there is new central pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature . 
There is no confluent consolidation or effusion . 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable , as are the osseous and soft tissue structures . 
IMPRESSION : Findings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema . 
CT Abd / Pelvis : 1 . 
Thickened bladder wall with surrounding stranding potentially secondary to cystitis and correlation with UA suggested . 
There is no retroperitoneal hematoma . 
Hypodense lesions in each kidney likely represent cysts , however , not fully characterized on nonenhanced CT scan . 
If desired US could help characterize . 
Enlarged prostate . 
Brief Hospital Course : 6 7 yom with history of a . fib , on pradaxa , now presenting with worsening BRBPR and hematuria . 
He remained normotensive throughout his MICU stay without drop in Hct . 
He was evaluated by GI who felt no urgent colonoscopy was needed , and symptoms were likely secondary hemorrhoidal and exacerbated by anticoagulation . 
He was transferred to the medical floor where he remained stable o / n . 
After discussion with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] the patient ' s out - patient cardiologist , given the fact that he has been in sinus for the better part of a year and has not flipped into AFIB he was d / c ' d on full dose ASA with GI f / u scheduled . 
He was subsequently switched to cefpodoxime given concern for prolonged QTc in combination with amiodarone . 
Micro showed a sensitive E . Coli . 
Anticoagulation was initially held , then switched to ASA as above . 
Thought to be secondary to volume depletion . 
The following day pulmonary exam had improved , patient was comfortable on room air . 
He refused scripts for inhalers at home , saying he only needs them when he is sick . 
Did well from this standpoint until discharge .

MRSA SCREEN ( Pending ) : . 
Radiology : CT HEAD W / O CONTRAST Study Date of [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] 4 : 5 8 PM Preliminary report FINDINGS : A 1 7 x 1 4 mm intraparenchymal bleed in the left lentiform nucleus is unchanged from the prior CT approximately six hours prior . 
There is mild mass effect due to surrounding edema with compression of the adjacent sulci , but no shift of the normal midline structures or evidence of herniation . 
No new foci of hemorrhage are present . 
A hypodense region just anterior to the hemorrhage is likely an old lacunar infarct . 
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration . 
The basal cisterns are patent . 
The visualized paranasal sinuses , mastoid air cells , and middle ear cavities are clear . 
IMPRESSION : No change in the left lentiform nucleus intraparenchymal hemorrhage . 
This is likely secondary to hypertension . 
Further workup to exclude vascular or neoplastic etiologies can be pursued based on clinical correlation . 
CTA HEAD W & W / O C & RECONS Study Date of [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] 3 : 1 8 AM FINDINGS : As seen on the previous CT , there is a 1 . 7 cm x 1 . 4 cm x 2 . 4 cm sized acute intracranial hematoma in the left basal ganglia with surrounding edema . 
There is no appreciable mass effect on the lateral ventricle . 
There is no midline shift . 
An old infarct is seen in the left anterior basal ganglia extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle . 
Also seen are multiple chronic lacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei . 
Visualized orbits , paranasal sinuses , and mastoid air cells are unremarkable . 
No fracture is seen . 
CTA HEAD : Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries , vertebral arteries , basilar artery and their major branches are patent with no evidence of stenosis , occlusion , or dissection . 
A small less than 2 - mm sized aneurysm is seen arising from the left ICA bifurcation . 
The anterior communicating artery appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Unchanged left basal ganglia hemorrhage . 
Chronic infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle as described above . 
Less than 2 - mm sized outpouching from the left ICA bifurcation may represent a tiny aneurysm . 
The anterior communicating artery appears bulbous without any definite saccular aneurysm . 
A - V conduction delay . 
Prolonged Q - T interval . 
Marked anterior and anterolateral T wave inversion consistent with metabolic abnormality or myocardial ischemia . 
No previous tracing available for comparison . 
CT revealed a left basal ganglia IPH and he was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] . 
Given the presence of the IPH , his warfarin was reversed and stopped . 
Patient was initially admitted to the ICU given significant hypertension requirinng an IV nicardipine infusion . 
He was transferred to the floor on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] . 
CTA was stable and no significant aneurysm was identified . 
Although the most likely cause for his IPH is hypertension , it was not possible to do an MRI to look for an underlying lesion given pacemaker . 
Aspirin should be started in 1 week and he will not be continued on warfarin . 
He was transferred to rehab on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] and has neurology follow - up . 
He should have a repeat CT head with and without contrast prior to his follow - up to assess for the presence of an underlying mass lesion . 
At OSH he was found to have a left basal ganglia hemorrhage . 
He was given 1 0 mg of Vitamin K for an INR of 2 . 6 ( no FFP was given ) and Labetalol 2 0 mg IV for a SBP in the 1 7 0 s . 
He was then transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further management . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED , he received Profilinine ( activated factor IX ) and received 2 units FFP later for INR 2 . 3 . 
Examination revealed right hemiparesis and right facial droop with dysarthria but no aphasia , neglect or visual field defect . 
He was started on a Nicardipine infusion for SBP up to 2 0 0 s and was admitted to the neuro ICU . 
His head CTs remained stable showing no extension of the bleed . 
CTA showed an old infarct in the left anterior basal ganglia extending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle in addition to multiple chronic lacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei and angiography demonstrated a less than 2 - mm sized aneurysm arising from the left ICA bifurcation . 
Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA 1 c 5 . 4 % and FLP revealed Cholesterol 2 4 0 TGCs 1 1 1 HDL 4 1 LDL 1 7 7 . 
CEs were negative . 
He was initially monitored with glucose fingersticks and this was stopped after several normal readings . 
He was therefore started on atorvastatin 4 0 mg daily and his fasting lipids should be repeated in 3 months . 
He continued to receive daily vitamin K until [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] and INR on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] was 1 . 0 . 
He passed bedside swallow evaluation and was placed on a regular diet . 
He slowly improved and was transferred to the neurology floor on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] . 
We held all antiplatelets and aspirin 3 2 5 mg should be started in 1 week . 
We stopped warfarin due to his hemorrhage . 
We were unable to obtain an MRI given the patient ' s pacemaker and he will therefore need a repeat CT scan with contrast to evaluate any possible malignancy underlying the hemorrhage before his neurology appointment . 
The most likely cause of his hemorrhage is a hypertensive bleed although his hypertension was controlled previously . 
As above we will evaluate with interval scan to look for an underlying lesion which may have bled . 
His weakness was slowly improving at the time of discharge . 
He was stable and BP was controlled on his home medications . 
He was assessed by PT and deemed to benefit from rehab . 
He was therefore transferred to rehab on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] . 
This was latterly controlled and BP on discharge was SBP 1 2 0 s - 1 3 0 s . 
He was briefly hypotensive in the setting IV nicardipine and home anti - hypertensives and this resolved before transfer to the flor . 
We continued patient ' s home lisinopril and carvedilol . 
We monitored his INR daily and was 1 . 0 on discharge . 
Warfarin was stopped and he should be restarted on aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily in 1 week . 
Patient was started on atorvastatin 4 0 mg daily as above and should have repeat FLP in 3 months . 
He was not known to have CRF . 
His Cr rose to 1 . 6 post - CT contrast on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] . 
This should be repeated in 2 days time and then at least weekly . 
This has been requested . 
Restart aspirin at 3 2 5 mg daily in 1 week . 
Please monitor Chem 7 as Cr rose from 1 . 3 to 1 . 6 following CT contrast . 
Repeat fasting lipids in 3 months . 
PO once a day . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid ( [ * * Hospital 6 * * ] or cane ) . 
Neurologic : A + Ox 3 Spanish speaking but speaks good English and follows commands well . 
Speech is dysarhtric but fluent and no evidence of mental status abnormalities with no neglect . 
Right facial droop and otherwise CN exam unremarkable .

Discharge Instructions : It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at the [ * * Known firstname 3 8 6 7 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) * * ] . 
You presented with right - sided weakness and facial droop . 
You had a CT scan and were found to have a bleed in your brain in the area of the left basal ganglia . 
As you were on warfarin ( Coumadin ) which is a blood thinner and worsens bleeding , this was reversed with medications and Coumadin was stopped . 
Your blood pressure was initially high and you had to be treated with IV medications to lower your blood pressure in the ICU . 
Your blood pressure normalised and you were transferred to the neurology floor . 
You did well and your strength on the right side was slowly improving . 
Your warfarin was stopped and should not be continued due to further risk of bleeding . 
You should stop aspirin currently and restrat at 3 2 5 mg daily in 1 week . 
We also started atorvastatin for high cholesterol as your cholesterol was found to be high . 
This should be repeated in 3 months time . 
Your kidney function tests were also slightly abnormal following the CT contrast and this will be followed at rehab . 
You were continued on your other home medications . 
The most likely cause of this brain hemorrhage was high blood pressure although given your pacemaker we were unable to do an MRI . 
You were deemed appropriate for rehab and transferred to rehab on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] . 
She was seen by her primary cardiologist [ * * 5 - 1 6 * * ] , at which time her flecainide was d / c ' ed and her metoprolol and diltiazem were increased for rate control .

Initially she was admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 5 1 6 * * ] where she was noted to be in volume overload and diuresed with furosemide , 4 0 mg IV . 
She was also given metoprolol ( at increased dose from 1 2 . 5 to 2 5 then 5 0 [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] over the course of two days ) and verapramil ( 1 8 0 mg qd ) for rate control . 
This morning she complained of chest pain , was noted to be bradycardic ( 6 0 s ) and hypotensive ( SBP in mid 7 0 s ) . 
She was given 1 . 5 lt of IVF bolus and started on dopamine ( uptitrated to 2 0 mcg ) . 
After these interventions her pressure improved to the 1 0 0 s but then decreased again to the 9 0 s . 
Her urine output remained low . 
She had cardiac enzymes drawn , the first set being negative , an ECG without ST changes , and a TTE , which showed global hypokinesis with EF of 2 5 % . 
Reportedly her EF from a TEE done in early [ * * Month ( only ) * * ] was near normal ( reported as mild depressed LVEF . 
Last ECHO before that was in 9 0 s with normal EF . 
Also has had a cath in the 9 0 s with normal coronaries , per report . 
Notably her INR is also elevated to 3 . 7 , presumably secondary to warfarin . 
Several days prior to presentation her VNA found her to be tachycardic to 1 2 0 s , and was referred Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] saw her [ * * 5 - 1 6 * * ] and d / ced her fleicanide and increased her metoprolol , which the patient did not take as she did not pick up prescirption . 
She also reports having chest pain / pressure o / n 4 d PTA , non - radiating , no n / v / diaphoresis resolved w / burping . 
Patient was recently admitted with Afib w / RVR , was cardioverted on [ * * 5 - 5 * * ] and discharged home on flecainide , verapamil , metroprolol . 
She has had no palpitations , no syncope , no PND or orthopnea .

Afib w / RVR . 
Pt . 
She was HD stable on admission and her INR was 3 . 6 . 
Her Afib recurrence was felt to be exacerbating CHF as evident on last TEE . 
Patient was restarted on Verapamil of 1 8 0 mg , her BB was increased to 3 7 . 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and her coumadin was held . 
On HD # 2 , patient developed afib with slow VR , chest pain , diaphoresis and nausea , her ECG was unchanged and her CE were negative x 1 . 
She subsequently developed hypotension to mid 7 0 s mmHgs , which did not respond to IVF and required dopamine for HD stability . 
She was temporarily transferred to CCU where pressors were weaned within few hours of arrival . 
It was felt that her hypotension was secondary to poor inotropy in setting of bradycardia from multiple nodal blocking agents . 
Throughout stay in CCU she was borderline tachycardic and was eventually placed back on small dose of lopressor for HR control . 
On HD # 3 she was transferred to the floor w / HR of 1 0 0 bpm and only on 1 2 . 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] of metoprolol . 
She remained HD stable and converted to atrial tachycardia vs . slow aflutter . 
Her BB was increased and she was started on low dose digoxin without loading , 0 . 1 2 5 mg EOD . 
On this regiment her HR was difficult to control . 
She continued to remain in Afib / flutter with HR in 1 0 0 s despite 5 0 mg TID of BB , digoxin . 
She was started on amiodarone and underwent cardioversion on [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 5 - 2 4 * * ] . 
This was successful , pt . 
Her BB was decreased to 1 2 . 5 [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] due to temporary bradycardia to high 4 0 s , digoxin was discontinued and amiodarone decreased to 2 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
With this regimen , HR maintained in 5 0 s , her DOE improved significantly and her lightheadedness and dizziness resolved . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 5 * * ] at ~ 1 1 pm patient was noted be unable to speak . 
Her neurological deficits included R facial droop and eye lid muscle weakness . 
Code stroke was called , CT head showed a L distal MCA stroke in insular region . 
No tPA was administered due to INR of 2 . 9 . 
Her INR became supratherapeutic with INR 3 . 9 on her day of discharge hence Coumadin is held for now . 
It needs to be restarted at 1 mg once daily once INR < 3 . 0 and needs daily monitoring until stable . 
Dosing may need to go up once Amiodarone dosing decreases to daily dosing on [ * * 6 - 2 * * ] . 
Also , patient should be started on lisinopril for heart protection on [ * * 6 - 2 * * ] . 
CAD - Pt . 
She had a clean cath in [ * * 2 1 2 7 * * ] . 
Based on above PMHx it was not suspected that she had flow limiting CAD , especially with no elevation of CEs in setting of cardiogenic shock . 
She ruled out for MI . 
She was continued on BB as above . 
Systolic CHF . 
Pt . 
Pt . 
She was continued on home dose of lasix . 
She was started on ACE - I , Lisinopril 5 mg daily , however due to renal failure , Cr . 
Her lasix was held on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] . 
This should be restarted within a day as tolerated by volume status , likely [ * * 5 - 2 7 * * ] ( home lasix dose of 4 0 mg PO ) . 
Acute on Chronic RF : Cr on admission up to 1 . 3 Likely due decreased CO w / LV CHF in setting of afib . 
Cr recovered to 1 . 1 , near baseline after complications with hypotension , however bumpted back up s / p cardioversion in setting of receiving extra 1 0 mg IV lasix . 
Cr improved to 1 . 2 on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] . 
Her lasix is currently being held . 
Left MCA infarct in the setting of therapeutic INR : Most likely cardioembolic given the risk factor and patient returned to Afib rhythm from sinus after cardioversion . 
Pt was not a thrombolytic or endovascular therapy candidate due to high INR hence high bleeding risk . 
Patient was transferred to the neurology service on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] and MRI showed that she has acute superior division of L MCA infarct ( precentral gyrus ) but not a large infarct hence safe for anticoagulation . 
Patient remains unable to speak , but can make vocalizations , and is able to swallow . 
She has mild R facial droop with weakness , more in the arm than leg . 
Physical and occupational therapy recommended acute rehab .

Discharge Condition : Hemodynamically stable , improved heart rate - mostly non - verbal / mute with new left MCA stroke with right facial droop and some right arm weakness ( more proximal and distal ) but strong in the lower extremities . 
Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] with recurrence of your rapid heart rate and lightheadedness . 
This was felt to be due to your failed cardioversion . 
You were treated with medications to reduce your heart rate . 
Your course was complicated by a rapid slowing of your heart and very low blood pressures that require temporary stay in an intensive care unit . 
It was also determined that your heart ' s pumping action was also poor . 
For this reason and your heart rate control , your medications were readjusted . 
You undewent cardioversion on [ * * 5 - 2 4 * * ] but afterwards was found to have right facial droop due to left MCA infarct . 
This was while your INR was therapeutic hence you were not candidate for thrombolysis or endovascular therapy given high risk of bleeding . 
You were transferred to neurology service on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] and evaluated per physical and occupational therapy who recommend acute rehab given your new stroke . 
Speech therapist also evaluated who recommended pureed diet with nectar liquid and crushed meds in puree . 
You were restarted on Amiodarone 2 0 0 mg twice daily on [ * * 5 - 2 7 * * ] which is to be continued for 1 week then starting on [ * * 6 - 2 * * ] , please switch to 2 0 0 mg once daily .

Compared to the prior radiograph obtained yesterday , there is decreased CHF . 
There is mild cardiomegaly . 
There are small bilateral effusions , more on the left . 
The new biventricular pacer device is seen in the left hemithorax . 
The pacer leads are seen in the right atrium and two in the floor of the right ventricle . 
The previous abandoned right pacer leads are also seen in the right atrium and right ventricle .

Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis / consolidation . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Improving CHF . 
Small bilateral layering pleural effusions , more on the left . 
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis / consolidation .

FINDINGS : There is no intra - or extra - axial hemorrhage . 
The appearance of the ventricles , cisterns , and sulci is unchanged . 
There is no mass effect , hydrocephalus , or shift of the normally midline structures . 
The [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 5 2 * * ] - white matter differentiation is preserved . 
The visualized mastoid air cells are clear . 
Again noted is sinus mucosal thickening bilaterally in the maxillary sinuses , not fully characterized here . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Similar sinus mucosal thickening . 
No evidence of significant interval change . 
Similar appearance of the brain including prominent encephalomalacic changes in the right occipital lobe , and possibly in the left occipital lobe as well . 
There are large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis . 
Otherwise , the lung bases are clear . 
Within the limitations of the non - contrast study , the liver , gallbladder , pancreas , spleen , and adrenal glands are within normal limits . 
A 7 - mm nonobstructing stone is again visualized in the left kidney , as well as a 1 2 mm stone in the left renal pelvis . 
These are unchanged . 
A small new 2 - mm nonobstructing stone is now seen in the right kidney . 
Left - sided hydronephrosis has resolved . 
Within the limitations of the non - contrast study , the appearance of the kidneys is otherwise unremarkable . 
There is calcification of the abdominal aorta , and of the splenic artery . 
The stomach , small and large bowel are unremarkable . 
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy , or free air or fluid . 
Along the anterior left lateral ribs at the base of the chest , there is a soft tissue density , not fully characterized here , which may represent a small hematoma or inflammatory stranding from recent pacer placement . 
Its extent is not delineated here . 
There is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma . 
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST : There is considerable amount of stool in the rectum . 
The prostate , seminal vesicles , and bladder are within normal limits . 
There is a 5 - mm calcific density in the distal left ureter , which could represent a nonobstructing stone . 
It was not seen previously . 
BONE WINDOWS : There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions .

No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma . 
Multiple nonobstructing stones in the kidneys bilaterally , as well as a 6 - mm calcific density in the left pelvis , which may represent a nonobstructing renal stone in the left ureter . 
FINDINGS : Grayscale and Doppler son [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 4 1 7 * * ] of the left internal jugular , axillary , basilic , and paired brachial veins show no evidence of deep vein thrombosis . 
Because of the presence of the overlying pacer , the left subclavian vein could not be evaluated . 
No intraluminal thrombus is identified . 
In the tissues overlying the pacemaker , there is heterogeneous appearance , which may represent postoperative change , but the presence of hematoma cannot be excluded . 
No large discrete fluid collection is identified . 
Laterally , near the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle , the appearance suggests either edematous muscle or complex fluid , but the static images presented are indeterminant . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Heterogeneous tissue in the region of the pacer , which is indeterminant in etiology . 
Suggestion of edematous left pectoral muscle and / or complex fluid , suggested by resident review in real time scanning . 
However on the static images , it is difficult to discern the relationship between the muscle , the adjacent heterogeneous soft tissue , and the pacer . 
A followup ultrasound for evaluation and comparison , or alternatively a CT , which may show an area of hyperdensity to correspond to an acute hematoma if present , is suggested . 
After the haldol wore off , mental status was felt to return to baseline . 
Of note , hematocrit was noted to drop on the day of procedure . 
CT abd / Pelvis was done and was negative for retroperitoneal bleed . 
Left upper extremity also noted to be more swollen on [ * * 1 - 1 8 * * ] and ultrasound was performed which was negative for DVT . 
He is able to movilize all extremities , still somnolent . 
Patient seemed to recover in the 1 0 - 1 2 hours post - sedation . 
Head CT was performed and was negative for intracranial bleed . 
Neurology was consulted and agreed that mental status changes likely to haldol being given .

A f / u cxr was improved and without pneumothorax . 
She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and Flagyl for the wound x 4 days . 
These antibiotics were switched to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep veridans , sparse yeast , Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and staph coag positive resistent to levo / oxicillin / penicillin and sensitive to vanco . 
Vanco levels were monitored . 
Creatinine remained stable . 
She developed a 2 nd UTI , yeast which was treated with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x 3 days .

There is bibasilar atelactasis , unchanged . 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable . 
NEURO : The patient had a dilantin level of 2 8 and Carbamazepin level of 3 . 
His increased seizure frequency was felt to be realted to toxic dilantin levels and infection . 
Over the course of this hospitalization , his medications where redosed multiple times and it was unclear what his home medications had been as there where discrepencies in his record . 
He was monitored on LTM while in the ICU and until his medications where stable and seizure frequency decreased . 
His last seizure was on [ * * 4 - 1 8 * * ] . 
Since that time he came of off LTM and continued to do well with no further seizures . 
He was started on a low dose lamicatal to be titrated slowly up as an outpatient . 
From a neurological standpoint his seiuzures have returned to baseline and he is ready for discharge . 
ID : There was initially no souce of infection identified on admission . 
Blood cultures grew Coagulase negative staph in [ * * 4 - 1 7 * * ] bottles . 
TTE was without evidence of no clear vegitations . 
Although the blood cultures where felt to be a contaminant . 
He was treated with a course of vancomycin emperically after discussion with ID . 
All subsequent cultures after [ * * 3 - 8 * * ] where negative . 
PULM : The patient was noted to have episodes of apnea while sleeping . 
He may warrent evaluation for sleep apnea . 
Social : The patient was ready for discharge but had an extended hospital stay secondary as he needed to go to rehab however the proper guardianship was not in place . 
This needed to be established by court order . 
Once this was done he was discharged to rehab . 
You were observed in the medical ICU for 6 days , with multiple rounds of viral and bacterial cultures . 
No causative organism was ever found . 
You were treated with broadspectrum antibiotics throughout this period . 
You had blood cultures positive for coag negative strep , which is most consistent with contamination and not a true positive finding . 
Regardless , you received sufficient vancomycin to cover this organism in the unlikely event that it represented a true infection . 
During this period of suspected sepsis your seizure frequency was noted to be higher than baseline . 
We have adjusted your anti - seizure medications during the hospitalization . 
You have been very stable and your last seziures was [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 4 - 1 8 * * ] . 
If you have an increase in seizure frequency please ensure the patient ' s doctor is notified . 
His post - operative course was significant for malnourishment . 
He required a dobhoff and tube feeds to supplement his nutrition . 
Once he was medically stable he was transferred to rehab for further rehabilitation . 
Prior to discharge there was some concern regarding his rising Alk Phos levels , but they trended back down and stabilized so it was decided to send him out with continued follow up . 
He now returns with findings of eleveated Alk Phos at rehab at 6 5 0 , AST 3 0 and ALT 8 0 . 
He was not having any new symptoms or complaints and states he is doing quite well at rehab . 
He reports stopping tobacco use 1 month ago , but prior to that smoked as much as 1 . 5 ppd . 
He denies illicit drug use , has no tattoos or piercing and denies a history of blood transfusions . 
Unmarried , lives in [ * * Hospital 1 6 6 8 7 * * ] . 
Wounds clean / dry / staple lines intact . 
Hepatic vasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices . 
There was small - volume ascites . 
On [ * * 1 - 2 2 * * ] a cholangiogram was done to assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature . 
Post procedure , he spiked a temperature to 1 0 4 . 
He was transferred to the SICU for management as he dropped his BP . 
He was treated with IV fluids and antibiotics were started ( meropenum and vanco [ * * 1 - 2 2 * * ] ) . 
Blood cultures grew Klebsiella oxytoca and VRE ( enterococcus facium ) . 
Antibiotics were switched to Dapto and Meropenum after 3 days to Daptomycin and Meropenum . 
He was treated for a total of 1 2 days of dapto ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 8 1 9 7 9 * * ] ) and meropenum ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 8 1 9 8 0 * * ] ) . 
Subsequent blood cultures on several days were negative . 
A right picc line was inserted ( [ * * 1 - 2 7 * * ] ) for IV antibiotics . 
Biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilation visualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosis site . 
A biopsy was then performed with features representing indeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection . 
This was treated by increasing his prograf with a target trough level of 1 5 . 
Prograf levels increased to 1 5 - 1 6 and as high as 1 8 . 
Dosage was adjusted . 
LFTs were notable for the alk phos dropping to 6 1 2 from 9 6 3 , but then alk phos continued to rise . 
On [ * * 1 - 2 8 * * ] , an MRCP was performed to assess for biliary obstruction or leak . 
This demonstrated diffuse mild - to - moderate dilatation of the entire intrahepatic biliary system . 
There were several foci of intrahepatic biliary stenosis as well as a 2 - cm segment of the distal CBD which demonstrated wall thickening and associated luminal stenosis . 
Distally , the segment abutted the anastomosis of CBD and jejunum . 
Between the diaphragm and the right lobe of the liver , was a small hematoma . 
There was a small amount of free fluid around the hepatic and splenic flexure . 
On [ * * 1 - 2 9 * * ] , he was re - biopsied with findings concerning for biliary obstruction or ischemia . 
Prograf was adjusted . 
On [ * * 2 - 3 * * ] , a cholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation of intrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bile duct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowing freely down to the small bowel . 
An internal - external biliary draining catheter was placed . 
After this procedure , LFTs trended down with alk phos decreasing to 4 4 6 from 1 1 5 5 over approximately six days on [ * * 2 - 1 0 * * ] . 
He developed severe bilateral upper and lower extremity tremors and ataxic gait likely from prograf toxicity causing a significant decline in his ability to ambulate . 
Neurology was consulted . 
This was felt to be related to the prograf , but thyroid function studies and a MRI of the head were done to assess his cerebellum . 
TFTs were significant for a slightly low T 3 otherwise TSH and T 4 were normal . 
The MRI was read by neuro and neurosurgery who felt that the MRI was unchanged compared to previous in [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 1 1 - 8 * * ] , prior to starting on immunosuppression . 
The two left hemipheric lesions were stable in size , non - enhancing with contrast , and of unclear etiology . 
His CSF profile [ * * 1 2 - 8 * * ] was normal , with no evidence of inflammation or pleiocytosis . 
He had CSF PCR negative at that time for HSV / EBV / CMV / [ * * Male First Name ( un ) 2 3 2 6 * * ] / [ * * Last Name ( LF ) * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] there was no need to repeat a spinal tap . 
HCV viral load was undetectable . 
A repeat MRI brain WITHOUT CONTRAST ( as lesions did not enhance and given risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis / Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy ) was recommended in 3 months to re - evaluate for evolution of these lesions . 
With adjustment of prograf , the trough levels decreased to 1 0 and the tremors diminished . 
Consequently , his mobility improved . 
Nutritionally , he required a feeding tube initially , but demonstrated sufficient caloric intake to remove the feeding tube . 
He was tolerating a regular diet . 
Vital signs were stable and he remained afebrile . 
PT worked with daily and recommended [ * * Hospital 4 1 5 1 8 * * ] rehab . 
He was accepted at [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
On the day of discharge , his PTC was removed , but the old insertion site continued to leak some bile . 
A urostomy pouch was placed over this site to collect and record volume of output . 
The roux tube that was present since his liver translant surgery was kept capped . 
Site was without redness or drainage . 
Twice weekly labs should be drawn for cbc , chem 1 0 , LFTs and trough prograf level with results called to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] Transplant Office [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 6 7 3 * * ] .

The mass is inhomogeneous in intensity , but predominantly hypointense to brain on the short TR images and markedly hyperintense on FLAIR and long TR spin echo images . 
There is a prominent cystic component anteriorly , extending into the right frontal lobe . 
This measures approximately 4 x 5 x 6 cm . 
The mass enhances inhomogeneously after contrast administration . 
The sella turcica is markedly enlarged . 
The mass extends into the prepontine cistern and grossly fills the left cavernous sinus . 
The left internal carotid artery is encased in its cavernous and supraclinoid portions as it courses through the mass . 
The optic chiasm is traumatically elevated by the lesion , and I cannot identify the course of the optic nerves as they pass over this lesion to approach the optic canals . 
This lesion appears most likely to represent a pituitary adenoma . 
The mass elevates the third ventricle and causes compression at the level of the foramen of [ * * Last Name ( un ) 2 0 4 4 * * ] . 
This apparently is responsible for bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles , more severe on the right than left . 
CONCLUSION : Massive sellar and suprasellar enhancing neoplasm , most likely a pituitary adenoma . 
There is compression of the optic chiasm and hydrocephalus due to elevation and compression of the ventricular system at the level of the foramen of [ * * Last Name ( un ) 2 0 4 4 * * ] . 
The appearance remains consistent with a pituitary adenoma . 
There is encasement of the left internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral arteries bilaterally course through the lesion . 
There is no evidence of interval hemorrhage . 
There is no hemorrhage along the course of the right ventriculostomy catheter , which is terminating in the third ventricle . 
Small - to - moderate pneumocephalus is likely post - surgical . 
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage . 
Small - to - moderate pneumocephalus persists , likely post - surgical . 
Stable size of the ventricles compared to [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 5 - 1 5 * * ] , with mild dilatation of the right lateral ventricle . 
He admitted to the ICU for close observation given his imaging . 
A MRI was obtained on [ * * 5 - 1 0 * * ] to better evaluate the lesions . 
On [ * * 5 - 1 1 * * ] a CTA head was obtained for surgical planning . 
Endocrine was also consulted given the sellar / suprasellar mass . 
Per Endocrine request , labs were ordered and a cortisol stimulation test was done on [ * * 5 - 1 2 * * ] AM . 
Hydrocortisone was held in order to perform cortisol stim test . a 1 gram Dilantin bolus was given for a serum dilantin level of 0 . 8 . 
Overnight the patient became very aggitated , pulling out his IV line requiring ativan . 
The Cortisol Stim teast was performed and the cortisol levels at 3 0 minites , 6 0 minites and 9 0 minites were . 2 - 3 0 mins , 2 1 - 6 0 mins , 2 2 - 9 0 mins . 
Neuro - optho was consulted for formal visual field testing which was done on [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 5 - 1 3 * * ] which demonstrated stable bitemporal hemianopsia . 
Endocrine recommended stopping the hydrocortisone and decreasing the decadron . 
Neuro and rad oncology were also consulted . 
On [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 5 - 1 4 * * ] , Patient underwent am aspiration of the right frontal cyst and EVD placement . 
He tolerated the procedure well without intraoperative complications . 
Please review dictated operative report for details . 
He was extubated and transferred to the ICU . 
Post operative Head CT revealed no hemorrhage and significant decompression . 
He was bolused with 5 0 0 mg of Dilantin for a subtherapeuric level of 7 . 2 and his dose was increased to 2 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
On [ * * 5 - 1 5 * * ] the EVD was clamped after CT head demonstrated stable ventricular size however it had to be opened approximately 2 . 5 hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode of confusion . 
It was opened at 1 0 cm above the tragus . 
Per Endocrinology the patient was given cabergoline 0 . 5 mg as a one - time dose and the patient was switched from dexamethasone to prednisone 7 . 5 mg daily according to their recommendations . 
He was given a Dilantin bolus of 5 0 0 mg for a Dilantin level of 9 . 6 . 
On [ * * 5 - 1 6 * * ] the patient ' s mental status was stable and so an EVD wean was started . 
The patient tolerated elevation of the drain to 2 0 cm above the tragus . 
Dilantin level was therapeutic at 1 2 . 9 . 
Pt was transfered to the stepdown unit . 
His ventricular drain was clamped several times but patient continued to have elevated ICPs and severe headaches . 
Plan for VP shunt was postponed on [ * * 5 - 2 0 * * ] for fever to 1 0 2 . 7 . 
Fever workup was negative for DVT with lower extremity Dopplers , negative consolidation on chest xray . 
Blood , urine and CSF cultures were sent on [ * * 5 - 2 0 * * ] . 
He devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction to dilantin and so the patient was transitioned to Keppra , Dilantin was stopped and the rash was treated topically with hydrocortisone cream and with Oral benadryl PRN . 
No respiratory distress , no oral swelling . 
He was afebrile on [ * * 5 - 2 1 * * ] and was neurolopgically stable with EVD in place while awaiting VP shunt placement . 
On [ * * 2 1 4 9 - 5 - 2 3 * * ] , patient had a right VP shunt place by Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] . 
On the day of surgery he had stress dose steroids with Hydrocortisone 5 0 mg Q 8 and then resumed prednisone 7 . 5 mg daily . 
Now DOD , pt is afebrile , vital signs are stable , and tolerating a good oral diet . 
His pain is well controlled and incision appear clean / dry / intact . 
He is set for d / c home in stable condition . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive .

Have a friend / family member check your incision daily for signs of infection . 
Take your pain medicine as prescribed . 
Exercise should be limited to walking ; no lifting , straining , or excessive bending . 
You may wash your hair only after sutures and / or staples have been removed . 
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures , you must keep that area dry for 1 0 days . 
You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover your head . 
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber , as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation . 
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener , such as Docusate ( Colace ) while taking narcotic pain medication .

Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) is a severe and life threatening condition that results from uncontrolled blood sugar . 
This episode of DKA happened becuase you were not regularly taking insulin and becuase your blood sugar was very high . 
Your recent sinus infection could have also worsened your condition . 
As a result of this condition , you required admission to the intensive care unit . 
During your hospitalization , your blood sugar , electrolytes , and metabolism , in general , were restored to a more normal condition . 
It is extremely important that you keep your blood sugars at more normal levels or this life - threatening condition will happen again . 
Also , you will develop eye problems , kidney disease , worse leg numbness , and heart disease if your sugars are not controlled better . 
In order to control your sugars , you need to follow the Insulin regimen that was prescribed by the [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] center . 
You will have to take 2 types of insulin . 
You will take a dose of long acting insulin ( Lantus ) every night and this dose will be constant . 
You will take a dose of Humalog insulin before every meal based on the sliding scale chart - thus you have to check your sugar at this time . 
If you find that you are unable to follow the above insulin plan , you have to call your doctor at the [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic . 
Due to your high use of Motrin before admission , you irritated the lining of your stomach . 
Thus , we treated this problem with a medicine to decrease the acid in your stomach called pantoprazole . 
You should continue taking this medicine until you see your PCP and [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) 1 0 7 4 8 * * ] your stomach problem . 
If you begin to again experience increasing nausea , vomitting , abdominal pain , or any other concerning symptom , you should contact your PCP or go to the ER . 
Followup Instructions : You need to follow up with Dr . [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 3 6 3 6 * * ] for diabetes care . 
Your first appointment is [ * * 4 - 2 9 * * ] at 4 PM . 
You can call ( [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 1 7 4 8 4 * * ] and ask for Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 6 4 2 3 8 * * ] office if this time does not work . 
You need to schedule an appointment with you primary care doctor within the next few weeks to followup your stomach pain after taking Motrin . 
He reports that he started feeling unwell yesterday afternoon with nausea , lightheadedness , and some shortness of breath . 
He denies chest pain or pressure , palpitations , vomiting , sweating . 
He was noted to be altered by his wife with concern re : difficulty speaking , perhaps a left sided facial droop and possible left hemianopsia , but limited evidence for this . 
The patient denies having any difficultly speaking or visual changes , but says that he was confused and seeing things that weren ' t there . 
His wife reported to the neurologist that he never had a facial droop . 
He reports chronic DOE , no CP at rest or with exercise , + claudication ( calf pain ) with ambulating 2 blocks , denies orthopnea , sleeps on 4 pillows at night . 
He reports LE edema at baseline . 
He lost 1 0 lbs over past 3 months , which he attributes to diet and exercise . 
He initially went to an OSH , where CT head was negative . 
He was found to have new [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] and elevated cardiac enzymes . 
He was hypotensive at OSH to SBP 8 0 s , started on peripheral dopamine and sent to the ED . 
In the ED , initial vs were : 9 8 . 9 8 6 9 4 / 4 5 on dopamine 2 0 9 5 % . 
He was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain . 
His exam was notable for [ * * 3 - 1 1 * * ] murmur , benign abdomen , rectal was guaiac neg . 
A bedside U / S in the ED was neg for pericardial effusion . 
Cardiology consult was requested for stat ECHO in ED , to look for new WMA , but was not performed . 
EKG was not felt to be markedly changed from baseline . 
There was some concern for aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w / o contrast , which was negative for aneurysm . 
Vascular was consulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely . 
Neurology was consulted for concern re : TIA and they did not feel he had a primary neurologic process . 
Due to persistent hypotension , a RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed . 
He was not given any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e / o infection . 
VS prior to transfer were 7 9 9 3 / 3 6 on levofed 0 . 1 2 mcg , 1 8 9 9 % on 3 L .

Less than 4 0 % stenosis of the right internal carotid artery . 
Reversal of flow in the right vertebral artery , suggestive of subclavian steal . 
Echo : [ * * 2 2 0 4 - 4 - 9 * * ] Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal . 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed ( LVEF = 2 5 - 3 0 % ) with global hypokinesis and apical akinesis . 
A left ventricular mass / thrombus cannot be excluded . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
There is no aortic valve stenosis . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal . 
No mitral regurgitation is seen . 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
Dissection cannot be detected due to lack of IV contrast . 
Unusually large appendix ( 1 2 mm diameter ) but no secondary signs of appendicitis . 
This may represent a mucocele , and elective resection should be considered . 
Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst , but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique . 
This can be further assesed with ultrasound . 
No acute intrathoracic , intraabdominal , or intrapelvic process seen . 
Enlarged pretracheal lymph node . 
He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam . 
His hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and demand ischemia . 
Home BP medications were held , and he was started on levophed with a goal MAP of 5 5 - 6 0 . 
On admission to the MICU , an a - line was placed for monitoring of his blood pressures . 
Overnight in the MICU he required increasing doses of levophed to maintain blood pressure . 
His CE were trended , showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia . 
Repeat Echo showed stable EF of 2 5 - 3 0 % , RV free wall hypokinesis and apical akinesis . 
The patient was transferred to the CCU for further management of cardiogenic shock . 
Levophed was transitioned to dopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis with good result . 
Dopamine was weaned off on [ * * 2 2 0 4 - 4 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Throughout hospitalization , patient was maintained on therapeutic INR with coumadin or with therapeutic PTT with heparin gtt given history of recently diagnosed LV thrombus . 
In setting of renal failure , patient was started on carvedilol on [ * * 2 2 0 4 - 4 - 1 1 * * ] and was not restarted on atenolol . 
As an outpatient , the patient should be restarted on [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] and spironolactone as tolerated by BP and recovery of kidney function . 
Of note , noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitor on patient secondary to severe PVD . 
Carotid dopplers showed possible subclavian steal on right , so BP should be monitored on left . 
Cardiac enzymes were trended , showing elevation of troponin to 0 . 9 5 with only mild CK elevation in the setting of worsened renal failure ( see below ) and cardiogenic shock . 
Patient continued on ASA , plavix and atorvostatin through duration of hospitalization . 
Atenolol was held secondary to renal failure and hypotension , and was later transitioned to carvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved . 
Carvedilol dose uptitrated to 2 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] by time of discharge but other anti - hypertensives were held since BP had been so low at presentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevated levels . 
Likely etiology secondary to ATN in the setting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow . 
Renal was consulted for help with management given his possible need for catheterization and severe renal dysfunction . 
Kidney function improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt . 
Home [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function . 
Renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6 . 5 . 
On discharge had improved to 3 . 8 and was trending in the right direction but will be rechecked on Monday at Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 5 4 5 2 * * ] office . 
Initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [ * * Doctor Last Name 6 8 8 * * ] mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolic encephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion from hypotension . 
Neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental status improved through hospital course . 
Neurology was consulted and felt that initial presentation was consistent with a TIA . 
HA 1 C was found to be 1 0 . 6 . 
Patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic stroke from known LV thrombus although this was held for a couple days during hospitalization while there was concern that proceedure might be needed as below . 
Had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this was held for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patient would need additional invasive proceedures . 
Placed on heparin gtt to cover while INR subtherapeutic . 
Warfarin was restarted 2 days prior to D / c and INR climbing but only up to 1 . 8 on day of D / c so pt administered one sub - cutaneous dose of 8 0 mg enoxaparin on day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of 8 0 mg enoxaparin the next day . 
Pharmacy was contact [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] to confirm that dosing should be 8 0 mg daily for therapeutic anti - coagulation in setting of improving renal failure . 
Trended through hospital course and noted to be downtrending . 
Home regimen was held upon admission given poor PO intake and patient transitioned to glargine + ISS . 
Insulin regimen was adjusted to maintain blood sugars in 1 0 0 - 2 0 0 . 
Ultimately put on NPH ( 7 0 / 3 0 ) regimen of 1 5 units in AM and 1 5 units in PM with ISS to cover . 
Discharged on this regimen . 
Large appendix ( 1 2 mm diameter ) but no secondary signs of appendicitis , enlarged pretracheal lymph node and hyperdense right renal mass that may represent a hemorrhagic cyst requires outpatient surgical follow - up .

Discharge Instructions : Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] , you were admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure and worsened kidney function . 
You initially were sent to the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your blood pressure . 
You had a cat - scan of your abdomen to see if there was something obstructing your kidenys . 
You received contrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect your kineys from the contrast . 
Your warfarin was stopped for a couple days because we thought you might need additional proceedures with high risk of bleeding . 
We also stopped many of your blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood pressure initially . 
Your kidney function has improved and should continue to improve and your blood pressure has come back up so we have restarted some blood pressure medications . 
Your INR is currently slightly less than 2 even though we have restarted your warfarin so you will get a shot of lovenox today and give yourself 1 shot of lovenox tomorrow to make sure your blood is thin enough until you are seen in clinic on Monday . 
While you were in the hospital there was also initially some concern that you had a stroke . 
The neurologic service came to see you and said you did not have a stroke but may have experienced what we call a TIA with no residual symptoms . 
You will follow up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] in clinic on Monday where you will have your INR and electrolytes checked . 
The following changes were made to your medications : - Start carvedilol 2 5 mg by mouth twice each day for blood pressure - Increase home furosemide to 8 0 mg by mouth once each day for fluid - Start enoxaparin 8 0 mg sub - cutaneously for 1 day ( only take this medication on Saturday , then stop ) - Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 7 0 / 3 0 taking 1 5 units in the morning and 1 5 units in the evening with a sliding scale to cover your meal time insulin ( see attached sheet ) - Continue your home Atorvastatin , warfarin , plavix , aspirin , folic acid - Stop all your other home medications for now until further instructed by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] : stop minoxidil , hydralazine , isosorbide mononitrate , spironolactone , cilostazol , atenolol , benicar , your former sliding scale . 
Weigh yourself every morning , [ * * Name 8 ( MD ) 1 3 8 * * ] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs . 
Please give yourself your enoxaparin shot on Saturday as mentioned above . 
Please make sure to check your blood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional insulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale . 
Followup Instructions : You have a follow - up appointment scheduled on Monday [ * * 2 2 0 4 - 4 - 1 6 * * ] with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] . 
You will have your INR and electrolytes checked at this visit . 
You also have a follow - up appointment scheduled with your PCP [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
At this appointment you should discuss the findings of your CT scan described below . 
While your kidneys looked fine there were the following findings which should be discussed with your PCP at next visit . 
Unusually large appendix ( 1 2 mm diameter ) but no secondary signs of appendicitis . 
This may represent a mucocele , and elective resection should be considered . 
Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst , but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique . 
This can be further assesed with ultrasound . 
Enlarged pretracheal lymph node . 
On arrival to the BMT floor , as he was transitioning into the bed , he became mom [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 1 7 1 1 * * ] unresponsive to verbal stimuli and physical stimuli . 
No jerking movements or incontience were noted . 
A code blue was called . 
On arrival of the code team , BP 1 2 4 / 8 0 , Hr 7 0 s , satting 1 0 0 % on 5 L NC . 
He was responsive to verbal stimuli and answering questions appropriately . 
He does not recall only seconds of the entire episode ; wife notes that his eyes were closed . 
An EKG was obtained which showed isolated peaked T waves . 
CXR showed no interval change when accounted for technique from prior in the day . 
During this time , he did experience a headache that was located in the forhead , temples and described as a pressure / squeeze that he has experienced with prior tension headaches . 
He was then transferred to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] for further cardiac monitoring . 
During this time , he was also noted to have some tremors in hands and legs , but this was not associated with any loss of consciousness or loss of consciousness . 
These episodes will occur for only seconds at a time and tend to occur when he is holding objects in his hands / intention tremor . 
He has not had formal workup for this , but there was no clear etiology to this tremor ( which has been present intermittently over the past 2 years ) to date . 
His wife also relays the presence of intermittent episodes of unresponsiveness over the past x 2 years ago at a frequency of 1 - 2 x per week lasting only seconds at a time . 
This has not been formally evaluated to date .

Brief Hospital Course : Summary of Hospital Course : 5 3 year old man with h / o AML s / p allo cord transplant ( day + 5 1 6 on admission ) complicated by chronic GVHD with arthritis , BOOP , who now presents to clinic with acute on chronic renal failure . 
Hospital course complicated by syncopal episode the day of admission resulting in Code Blue and hyperkalemia , requiring brief ICU admission . 
Unclear etiology , possible due to orthostatic hypotension ( noted to have orthostatic physiology in the ICU and on the floor ) vs arrythmia vs seizure activity . 
Of note , ( per wife ) , patient has had many of these episodes recently ( ~ 2 years , ~ 1 - 2 episodes per week ) . 
Patient denied any heralding symptoms and was not post - ictal afterwards , but was noted to have a resting tremor in the MICU . 
His history of tremor is not consistent wtih seizure activity . 
It appears to be an intention tremor that gets worse when holding on to objects and is low in amplitude while high in frequency , bilateral and not associated with change in consciousness or incontinence . 
Noted to be hyperkalemic during the code , given amp D 5 0 and 1 0 U insulin peri - code and kayexalate in the ICU , with drop in potassium down to 4 . 0 on discharge . 
Neurology consulted on patient who recommended EEG and possible midodrine or fluorinef support . 
Held patient ' s lisinopril , but continued him on his carvedilol 1 2 . 5 mg PO BID as this was recently decreased in the setting of light headedness / dizziness by his cardiologist on [ * * 3 - 2 1 * * ] , although informed him not to take the medication if he had any pre - syncopal symptoms . 
Medication can be decreased at the discretion of his cardiologist . 
Patient had no further syncopal episodes or events on telemetry in the ICU or on the floor . 
Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG , possible blood pressure support with midodrine or fluorinef , at the discretion of the patient ' s outpatient oncologist and nephrologist .

Per outpatient notes , etiology of CKD thought to be [ * * 2 - 1 4 * * ] ATN that has not resolved , medication effect in the setting of bactrim , voriconazole , lisinopril , or AIN . 
Less likely due to AML infiltration of kidneys ( very rare ) or chemotherapy . 
Unlikely progressive glomerular disease given patient only has scant proteinuria . 
Patient has refused renal biopsy in the past . 
Baseline Cre has been 1 . 4 - 2 . 0 over the past few months . 
Lisinopril was held .

Oral fluid intake encouraged . 
Renal failure resolved to baseline creatinine ( 1 . 9 ) on discharge . 
Renal did not have chance to formally consult on patient since he requested discharge , but stated informally that they had no further recommendations as an inpatient since he was refusing renal biopsy , and he could be accommodated very soon in renal clinic with his current outpatient nephrologist . 
Requested TTE as outpatient . 
Continued home meds including aspirin , beta - blocker . 
Held ACEI due to hyperkalemia . 
Arranged to follow up with outpatient oncologist .

He was last admitted to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] [ * * 2 1 0 5 - 6 - 2 9 * * ] with disabling claudication and rest pain in his bilateral lower extremities . 
For this , right common iliac artery to common femoral artery bypass and femoral - femoral cross - over graft were performed . 
Past Medical History : Hyperlipidemia laryngeal CA basal cell ca peptic ulcer dz hx . 
The nasogastric tube and the left internal jugular central venous catheter remain in good positions . 
There is interval worsening of bilateral perihilar and basilar opacities , consistent with increasing congestive heart failure . 
There are persistent opacities in the right and left upper lobe , consistent with pneumonia or aspiration . 
Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the upper mid abdomen and just above the gastroesophageal junction .

Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the thoracic aorta . 
Mural thrombus is noted in the proximal abdominal aorta . 
There is an unchanged ill - defined hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid gland , measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm . 
There is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the spleen , unchanged compared to the [ * * 2 1 0 6 - 2 - 1 3 * * ] abdominal CT , which may represent a splenic infarction . 
Scattered calcified granulomas are again noted in the liver . 
Stones are again seen in the gallbladder . 
Surgical clips are again noted in the porta hepatis and in the region of the gastroesophageal junction . 
The imaged portions of the pancreas , adrenal glands , and kidneys appear unremarkable .

Small bilateral pleural effusions . 
Mild central tracheal dilatation . 
Diffuse mild - to - moderate bronchiectasis in the upper and middle lobes .

Cholelithiasis . 
Unchanged hypodense lesion in the right lobe of the thyroid . 
Right bundle - branch block . 
Compared to tracing # 1 , no diagnostic change . 
There is mild hazy opacity within the lung bases which could represent normal lung at expiration , however mild ground glass airspace disease cannot be excluded . 
There is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver . 
No concerning hepatic lesions . 
There are multiple small gallstones dependently within the gallbladder . 
No gallbladder wall thickening . 
No biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis evident . 
There is a choledochojejunostomy , which is normal in appearance . 
Within the inferior aspect of the spleen , there is a large hypodense lesion , without enhancement measuring 4 . 4 x 4 . 3 x 3 . 9 cm that has significantly increased since the [ * * 5 - 7 * * ] study . 
There is an adjacent smaller similar - appearing lesion lateral to this larger lesion . 
These are nonspecific but considerations would include a splenic infarct . 
There is no stranding around these lesions , however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded . 
Small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged . 
The pancreas is normal in appearance . 
The patient has undergone gastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy . 
Adrenal glands are normal in appearance . 
No bowel wall thickening . 
No evidence of bowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction . 
The appendix contains contrast within it and gas , possibly from prior CT scan . 
No evidence for appendicitis . 
Small amount of fluid within the right lower quadrant is nonspecific . 
The kidneys show heterogeneous hypoenhancement symmetrically in a patchy geographic pattern in some locations . 
These areas have heterogeneous enhancement still on nephrographic phase . 
There is no persistent staining on the delayed images , nor is there contrast within the kidneys on the pre - contrast CT remaining from [ * * 2 1 0 6 - 2 - 1 1 * * ] angiogram . 
These findings are nonspecific but considerations would include embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol or other emboli . 
Of note , there is a large calcified plaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin with at least moderate narrowing of the right renal artery . 
There is also moderate narrowing of the left renal artery at its origin . 
There are multiple cysts within the kidneys bilaterally . 
There are multiple hypoattenuating lesions which are too small to characterize but likely cysts .

There is a rectal tube with balloon inflated within the rectum . 
Subsequent administration of rectal contrast shows no leakage of contrast and no other abnormality . 
No lymphadenopathy . 
CT ARTERIOGRAM WITH IV CONTRAST : There is diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with a large amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta . 
There is an ulcerated plaque within the infrarenal aorta with a small neck . 
This does not extend beyond the normal contour of the aorta . 
The left common iliac artery is occluded , as before . 
There is reconstitution of the left external iliac artery from retrograde flow and there is minimal flow within the left internal iliac artery . 
The right common iliac artery is patent at its origin and then there is a bypass graft from the right common iliac artery to the right common femoral artery . 
Native right common iliac artery distally and the external iliac artery is occluded with an old stent in place . 
The iliac - femoral graft is widely patent . 
Just distal to its insertion within the right common femoral artery , there is a right to left femoral - femoral bypass graft which is widely patent . 
This is just superior to an excluded partially thrombosed old femoral - femoral bypass graft which contains gas within it , likely from recent surgery . 
Bilateral superficial femoral arteries are patent proximally though diminutive . 
There are small fluid collections about bilateral common femoral arteries near the graft origin / insertions , both of which contain small amounts of gas , likely related to recent surgery . 
Just distal to the insertion site of the femoral - femoral bypass graft on the left is a round fluid collection that on pre - contrast images is heterogeneous in density and post - contrast images shows a small amount of contrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries with progressive increased density dependently within the collection seen , making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm . 
This is best demonstrated on series 2 , 3 , and 4 , images 9 0 - 9 4 and series 6 B , images 1 8 6 - 1 8 9 . 
The arteries distal to the graft sites are patent within the visualized portions . 
SMA , [ * * Female First Name ( un ) 8 9 9 * * ] , and celiac artery are all patent and without evidence of proximal stenoses . 
As mentioned above , the right renal artery has a large calcified plaque just beyond its origin with at least moderate stenosis . 
The left renal artery has moderate stenosis at its origin . 
BONE WINDOWS : There is multilevel lumbar disc degeneration . 
No suspicious bone lesions . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Aortic atherosclerosis with ulcerated plaque in the infrarenal aorta . 
Occluded left common iliac artery with external iliac artery reconstitution from retrograde flow from fem - fem bypass graft . 
Patent right common iliac - femoral bypass graft and right to left femoral - femoral bypass graft with patent superficial femoral artery distal to the bypass grafts in the visualized portions . 
Just distal to the left insertion of the fem - fem bypass graft with findings are highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm . 
Gas and fluid about the bilateral femoral [ * * Female First Name ( un ) 1 1 0 6 * * ] operative sites and gas within the old thrombosed fem - fem bypass graft likely related to surgery . 
Increased size of hypodense splenic lesions that could represent infarcts . 
No secondary signs of infection , however this cannot be excluded . 
Patent SMA and [ * * Female First Name ( un ) 8 9 9 * * ] without evidence of bowel abnormality . 
Bilateral patchy heterogeneous perfusion abnormalities within the kidneys suggesting recent bilateral renal insult , possibly from embolic phenomenon such as cholesterol emboli . 
There is also bilateral renal artery stenosis , slightly worse on the right than the left , at least a moderate degree . 
Bilateral pulmonary small airways disease , worse in the bases than in [ * * 2 1 0 5 - 5 - 3 * * ] .

This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow - up appointment . 
Activity may prevent the wound from healing . 
Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon . 
Try to keep your affected limb elevated when not in use , This decreases swelling to the affected wound and helps in the healing process . 
You may have an ace wrap around the affected limb with the wound . 
This helps prevent swelling to the area . 
You may take this off at night . 
But when you are doing activity the ace wrap should be worn . 
Take as directed . 
Be sure you take the full course even if the wound looks well healed . 
Failure to do so may lead to infection .

The patient was a pleasant , well - developed , well - nourished male in no acute distress . 
His HEENT examination was normal except for dry mucous membranes . 
His neck was supple with 7 cm of jugular venous pressure . 
His chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
He had a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur . 
His abdomen was soft and nondistended with mild epigastric tenderness and normal active bowel sounds . 
The patient had black stools that were guaiac positive . 
His extremities showed no pedal edema . 
Pulses were + 2 bilaterally . 
Neurological examination was grossly intact . 
The patient was alert and oriented x 3 . 
Nasogastric lavage was deferred as EGD was to be done . 
The remainder of the patient ' s complete blood count , chem - 1 0 and basic coagulation studies were within normal limits . 
Chest x - ray showed no infiltrates or interstitial edema . 
In the second part of the duodenum a fresh clot located between the duodenal bulb and the ampulla was noted . 
After washings there was fresh bleeding that completely obscured visualization . 
Despite multiple attempts of washings , therapeutic cautery was impossible with EGD . 
Given the brisk bleeding , an emergent artery embolization was needed . 
Interventional radiology performed an embolization of the gastroduodenal artery and noted a pseudoaneurysm at the entrance into the duodenum . 
This was performed on [ * * 2 1 6 8 - 4 - 1 8 * * ] . 
The patient ' s hematocrit reached a nadir of 1 3 . 9 on [ * * 2 1 6 8 - 4 - 1 8 * * ] and required six units of packed red blood cells for resuscitation . 
Following the embolization described above the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit remained stable at approximately 2 8 . 
The patient ' s diet was advanced slowly 4 8 hours following the procedure without complications . 
Serial examinations were performed to evaluate for ischemic colitis which revealed a completely benign abdomen . 
Gastroenterology followed the patient during the course of admission and made several recommendations to decrease future risks of GI bleeding , including Protonix b . i . d . 
Prior to discharge , a repeat endoscopy was done to reevaluate the region of active bleeding . 
This was performed on [ * * 2 1 6 8 - 4 - 2 1 * * ] and revealed a shallow ulcer in the second part of the duodenum . 
Per gastroenterology , this region is stable and the patient does not require further follow up from their department unless there are signs of recurrent bleeding , such as presyncope , bloody stools , melena , or hemodynamically instability . 
Helicobacter pylori was negative . 
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction . 
He had a normal EKG . 
Pain resolved with treatment of upper GI bleed and with Ultram .

At the beginning , it showed a low voltage faster pattern in all areas with bursts of focal slowing especially in the left temporal region . 
There were also some runs of rhythmic 6 Hz slowing in the left temporal area and other runs of periodic slowing with sharp features , none lasting for more than 8 - 1 0 seconds or so . 
On video , they did not appear to have any clinical correlate . 
By the evening , the background was more suppressed and , while left temporal slowing was still evident , the sharp features were not . 
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS : Showed a few of the left temporal sharp features , especially early in the record . 
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS : Showed no electrographic seizures . 
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS : There were none . 
SLEEP : No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident . 
CARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm . 
IMPRESSION : This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations . 
There was continued focal slowing in the left temporal region . 
Early in the record , this also included some runs of irregular sharp activity and some 6 Hz rhythmic slowing in the same area , but these episodes did not appear to show any clinical evidence of seizure on video . 
They were brief . 
No more prolonged and clear electrographic seizures were recorded . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 1 8 - 3 - 1 8 * * ] : Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and worsening basilar atelectasis . 
The left PICC has been removed . 
There is no focal consolidation , large pleural effusion , or pneumothorax . 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured . 
MR head [ * * 2 1 1 8 - 3 - 1 9 * * ] : FINDINGS : The study is compared with most recent enhanced MR examination of [ * * 2 - / 2 1 1 8 * * ] , as well as the remote study of [ * * 2 1 0 9 - 9 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Again demonstrated is the extensive confluent T 2 - / FLAIR - hyperintensity throughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter , with similar abnormality involving the posterior fossa , including the brainstem , cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres . 
Allowing for the motion artifact , above , the overall appearance is unchanged . 
By and in - large , the extensive lesions demonstrate intrinsic T 1 - hypointensity , representing " black holes " of irreversible demyelination . 
However , there is a prominent curvilinear or " targetoid " 1 6 mm focus of enhancement in the right corona radiata with a possible second enhancing focus in the corresponding location on the left . 
The right - sided focus appears new since the [ * * 4 - / 2 1 1 7 * * ] examination , though previously , there was a smaller , more nodular focus in the immediately adjacent centrum semiovale . 
Allowing for the marked limitation in the post - contrast imaging , no other definite enhancing focus is seen , with apparent interval resolution of the left - sided subcortical white matter , temporal lobar and cerebellar hemispheric foci . 
Currently , there is no pathologic leptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement . 
There is no definite focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event , and the principal intracranial vascular flow - voids , including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved and these structures enhance normally . 
In comparison to the more remote study there is no definite progression of the marked global atrophy ( particularly given the patient ' s age ) or the severe diffuse atrophy of the corpus callosum . 
Limited imaging of the upper cervical spinal cord , through the mid - C 4 level , demonstrates no definite abnormality . 
IMPRESSION : The study , particularly the post - contrast MP - RAGE acquisition , is quite limited by motion artifact , with : 1 . 
Curvilinear rim - enhancing focus in the right corona radiata appears new since the [ * * 2 1 1 7 - 4 - 6 * * ] study and likely represents a site of active inflammation ; allowing for the limitation above , there is no definite additional enhancing focus , with apparent interval resolution of many of the foci demonstrated on that study . 
Marked global and corpus callosal atrophy , not significantly changed since the [ * * 9 - / 2 1 0 9 * * ] study . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 1 8 - 3 - 2 5 * * ] : : A right - sided PICC terminates within the distal SVC . 
The aeration of the lungs has improved compared to the prior study . 
Cardiac silhouette is stable . 
No large pleural effusions are seen . 
There is no pneumothorax . 
Bones are intact . 
IMPRESSION : Right - sided PICC terminating within the distal SVC . 
Brief Hospital Course : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 4 5 8 5 5 * * ] is a 4 4 yoM with h / o multiple sclerosis , baseline cognitive defects , chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter and recurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with a UTI and new onset seizures . 
After initially being admitted to the floor , he developed seizures requiring 1 0 mg IV ativan and started on fosphenytoin with a load and transferred to the MICU . 
He was noted to be increasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea . 
ABG showed acidemia with CO 2 on the 7 0 s . 
He was started on Bipap with improvement in his CO 2 . 
It was presumed that his central apnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowly improved with clearance of the ativan . 
He was started emperically on vanc / ctx / amp / acyclivir to cover both his UTI and for empiric coverage for meningitis given his AMS . 
A head MRI was done , which showed unchanged appearance of extensive demyelinated , w / new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia , likely site of active inflammation , no evidence of ischemic event , unchanged marked global atrophy . 
Given that meningitis was less likely he was narrowed to vanc / [ * * Known lastname * * ] . 
He began to wake up over the day on [ * * 3 - 1 9 * * ] and was weaned off BiPap to a shovel mask and transferred to the floor . 
On the floor , he remained stable throughout the day on [ * * 3 - 2 0 * * ] . 
However , that morning was noted to be more tachycardic and febrile to 1 0 3 in the setting of hypoxia to the 8 0 s . 
He was put on a NRB and sats remained in the 8 0 s for a while before improving to the mid - 9 0 s . 
ABG on NRB was 7 . 4 8 / 4 0 / 7 2 . 
His eyes were open but wasn ' t following commands and appeared obtunded on the floor . 
CXR on the floor showed no new infiltrate . 
Patient was transitioned to the MICU and briefly broadened to vanco / [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) * * ] / flagyl for aspiration pneumonia , but quickly narrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status . 
By morning patient was alert and oriented X 3 , communicating and breathing comfortably on 2 L nasal cannula with saturation in mid to high 9 0 s . 
Abx were again narrowed to [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 2 1 3 4 7 * * ] / Vanco for coverage of UTI . 
Patient was then called out to floor . 
Infectious causes in setting of severe MS [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 4 5 8 6 1 * * ] seizures , most notably his UTI . 
He was started on fosphenytoin IV initially , then transitioned to phenytoin PO once mental status improved . 
There was no sign of further seizure activity . 
He will f / u w / [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) 7 3 0 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] in ~ 2 weeks . 
Mental status then to near baseline by discharge suggesting largely resultant from infections / medications / post - ictal state . 
He will is on vancomycin / ceftazidime , and will complete a 1 4 day course . 
A PICC line was insserted and home infusion company will assist w / antibiotics . 
There was a question of home aids flushing his foley , thus potentially introducing pathogens . 
There should be no flushing of the foley and this was addressed w / wife and in page 1 instructions . 
Component of redman syndrome was suspected . 
Benedaryl was given w / vancomycin and this improved his symptoms . 
There was no other evidence of allergic disease , and no facial swelling or airway obstruction . 
No signs of active bleeding . 
No rashes on exam . 
He had been exposed to heparin in the last 3 0 days , so PF 4 antibody was checked and was negative . 
His platelets responded to baseline by discharge , and likely this was all secondary to acute infection . 
Discharge Medications : 1 . ceftazidime 2 gram Recon Soln Sig : One ( 1 ) Recon Soln Injection Q 8 H ( every 8 hours ) for 6 days . 
Give IV benadryl prior to infusion . 
Infuse over 2 hours .

Disp : * 3 0 0 Tablet , Chewable ( s ) * Refills : * 1 * 1 0 . 
Benadryl 2 5 mg Capsule Sig : One ( 1 ) Capsule PO twice a day : give 2 0 minutes before vancomycin infusion . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair . 
You were admitted for a urinary tract infection . 
You then developed seizures . 
You had a head MRI , which showed a new area of multiple sclerosis , and this plus the infection is probably why you had a seizure . 
You were started on antibiotics and anti - seizure medications , and got much better . 
The following changes have been made to your medications : * * START phenytoin ( dilantin ) [ anti - seizure medication ] . 
NP saw pt and had discovered low BP and recommended transfer to ED given her low BP and weakness . 
No other complains or symptoms had been endorsed . 
She was taken to [ * * Hospital 1 2 0 2 5 * * ] and was transfered without prior transfusion to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] based on family request . 
EGD ( [ * * 2 1 4 7 - 5 - 8 * * ] ) Esophagus : Lumen : A complex , sliding , medium paraesophageal hernia was seen . 
Stomach : Normal stomach . 
Duodenum : Excavated Lesions . 
A single cratered ulcer was found in the duodenal bulb . 
A clot suggested recent bleeding . 
A single superficial ulcer was found in the distal bulb . 
A visible vessel suggested recent bleeding . 
A hemoclip was then applied to the visible vessel . 
Brief Hospital Course : MICU course : 2 large - bore IVs were placed . 
The pt ' s ASA , BB , ACEi and Lasix were held . 
She had no further BMs or melena . 
She remained HD stable with SBP in 1 1 0 s and HR in 7 0 s after initial 2 L NS bolus . 
She was transiently on a PPI drip and was transfused a total of 4 U with HCT coming up to 2 7 from 1 8 . 
Her HCT remained stable after these initial 4 units . 
GI did not feel that the pt was still actively bleeding , thus no urgent scope was performed in the MICU . 
She was switched to PPI IV bid and started on clears which she tolerated well . 
The pt was transferred to the medicine floor for further management . 
Floor Course : # GI bleed : The pt required a total of 7 units pRBCs to maintain her HCT over her hospital course . 
She had an EGD performed by GI which demonstrated a single cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb with stigmata of recent bleeding . 
This was injected with epinephrine and clipped ; GI indicated that a risk of rebleeding remained . 
The pt was treated with a Protonix gtt for > 4 8 hours and then transitioned to PO therapy [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
The pt ' s HCT was stable for the remainder of her [ * * Hospital 6 2 6 8 1 * * ] hospital stay at around 2 7 to 2 8 . 
The pt ' s antihypertensives were held in this setting and her blood pressure was well - controlled with only diltiazem . 
The pt ' s home aspirin was held . 
In the setting of having her beta blocker held , the pt was noted to have several episodes of AF with RVR ( HR to the 1 4 0 s ) , as well as two episodes of SVT ( HR again to 1 4 0 s ) that was thought to likely represent AVNRT . 
All of these episodes were asymptomatic for her and she remained HD stable . 
A TSH and CXR were checked and were unremarkable . 
Although the pt ' s HR responded well to re - initiation of her beta blocker , this did not suppress her SVT , and thus her beta blocker was transitioned to PO diltiazem . 
At the time of discharge , she had not had any SVT for 2 4 hours . 
We would suggest possible up - titration of her diltiazem as allowed by her HR and BP , and eventual conversion to the long - acting form of the medication . 
A chest x - ray after several days without Lasix did not demonstrate any evidence of failure . 
A echo in [ * * 2 1 4 5 * * ] demonstrated preserved EF and mild AR . 
As above , the pt ' s ACEi , beta blocker and lasix were held at admission ; * * * these may need to be restarted in the future . 
Her ASA was held throughout her hospital stay as described above . 
When her HR was elevated , the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse ST depressions which resolved with better HR control , thus continued aspirin therapy , likely at 3 2 5 mg daily , would be ideal . 
This was deferred at the time of discharge so that the pt ' s HCT could be followed for another 1 - 2 weeks . 
There was no evidence of delirium . 
PO Q 1 2 H ( every 1 2 hours ) . 
Diltiazem HCl 3 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO QID ( 4 times a day ) . 
Citalopram 2 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO at bedtime . 
Vital signs and HCT stable . 
Pt moderately deconditioned .

INDICATION : Status post removal of left - sided chest tube . 
Since the recent chest radiograph , a left - sided chest tube has been removed . 
A small left apical pneumothorax is present , best visualized on the lateral view . 
In retrospect , this is also present on the pre - chest tube removal radiograph and is without interval change . 
On the PA view , the pneumothorax was partially obscured by the overlying chest tube on the previous film , rendering it more difficult to visualize prospectively . 
The remainder of the chest radiograph is without change since the recent radiograph . 
IMPRESSION : Small left apical pneumothorax , stable in retrospect compared to pre - chest tube removal radiograph of earlier the same date . 
Please assess for bowel obstruction .

Restarted argatroban and coumadin [ * * 1 0 - 1 * * ] following CT surgery . 
She was initially on coumadin 2 . 5 mg PO QHS and stable with an INR between [ * * 2 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Her INR started to trend down , however , and her coumadin was adjusted to 3 mg PO QHS . 
Before discharge however , her INR started to trend up slightly past 3 , so she was discharged on 2 . 5 mg PO QHS . 
Her INR will be followed up by her PCP during her appointment later this week . 
He has been called regarding this . 
Guillain - [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] Syndrome : She was s / p four cycles of plasmapheresis ( didn ' t get fifth cycle due to developing HIT ) . 
Her tracheostomy was dwonsized on [ * * 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] .

Earnest Branche returned to the office today for a follow up visit . 
As you know , Mr . Branche underwent a left femoral to posterior tibial bypass one month ago followed by amputation of a gangrenous first toe . 
After being discharged from our service he was readmitted to the Medical Service with a severe case of C . difficile colitis . 
Ultimately this resolved and he was discharged . 
Today he reports that the diarrhea has again resumed and he was placed back on an oral antibiotic yesterday . 
He complains of only mild incisional discomfort in his left leg . 
On examination , there is a strong pulse easily palpated over the left lower extremity bypass graft . 
The old right lower extremity bypass graft was also palpable . 
The left foot itself is warm . 
The great toe incision site , however , has developed necrotic tissue all along the incision , which was sharply debrided to clean margins . 
This will now need to be treated as an open wound . 
The calf portion of the left lower extremity incision also has a narrow zone of superficial skin slough which was gently debrided . 
The graft is not exposed and there are no deep wounds in the leg . 
Mr . Branche ' s left lower extremity bypass graft is functioning well . 
However , he will require significant ongoing wound care for the immediate future .

PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION . 
Reported to and read back by DR [ * * First Name 4 ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 2 8 0 8 9 * * ] [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 9 - 2 7 * * ] 1 1 : 2 0 AM . 
As compared to the most recent prior radiograph from [ * * 9 - 2 7 * * ] and [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 9 - 2 6 * * ] , there is significant improvement in widespread parenchymal opacities with the current study representing mild interstitial pulmonary edema . 
There is small focal opacity in the left upper lung and left lower lobe which might reflect partial resolution of the infectious process . 
Hilar enlargement is bilateral , unchanged and might potentially correspond to hilar lymphadenopathy , although pulmonary enlargement might be another possibility . 
There is no appreciable pleural effusion , and there is no pneumothorax . 
Portable TTE ( Complete ) Done [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] at 3 : 0 6 : 1 4 PM IMPRESSION : Moderate aortic valve stenosis . 
Pulmonary artery hypertension . 
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis . 
Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function . 
Increased PCWP . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 8 - 1 7 * * ] , the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed , right ventricular cavity size is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and the estimated PA systolic pressure is much higher . 
The severity of mitral regurgitation seems reduced . 
These findings are suggestive of an interim acute pulmonary process , e . g . , pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary process . . . 
Brief Hospital Course : A / P : 5 6 year old woman with a history of cognitive delay , DMII , recently diagnosed Crohn ' s disease on prednisone , probable latent TB on INH , MRSA bacteremia from PICC on daptomycin ( last dose [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] ) , who was admitted with hypoglycemia related to an increase in her antihypoglycemic medications , with course complicated by viral pneumonia and respiratory distress , now resolved . 
ACTIVE ISSUES : . 
She was treated with D 5 0 IV and her anti - hypoglycemics were held , glucose normalized and her mental status returned to baseline . 
She was maintained on a sliding scale insulin while in hospital . 
She was discharged on antihypoglycemic regimen from prior to medication increases prior to admission . 
We recommend continued monitoring of her finger glucose and gradually increase glipizide or pioglitazone as needed . 
Her CXR was concerning for HCAP as well as vascular congestion . 
Patient received 2 0 mg of IV lasix as well as nebs . 
Antibiotics broadened to cefepime , but had persistent tachypnea , with CXR demonstrating worsening bilateral infiltrates . 
Again received nebs , Lasix 2 0 mg IV ( last dose at MN ) with UOP 1 L . 
She continued to have worsening respiratory function and was transferred to the MICU in obvious respiratory distress with accessory muscle use and audible grunting . 
The decision was made to electively intubate with anesthesia / respiratory at bedside . 
During intubation patient paralyzed with succ with initial transient hypotension to the 7 0 s . 
Uncomplicated intubation performed and patient sedated with propofol and fentanyl . 
The cause of her respiratory decompensation was probably multifactorial . 
Her antibiotics were broadened to linezolid / cefepime / levofloxacin for possible multifocal pneumonia . 
Given CXR evidence of bilateral pulmonary edema , cardiogenic source was suspected and she was diuresed . 
TTE revealed normal left ventricular function but right ventricular overload thought to be related to her acute pneumonic process . 
She underwent bronchoscopy on [ * * 2 1 3 1 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] which revealed + yeast , + PMN , and + rhinovirus , but no PCP or bacteria . 
Her rhinovirus may have contributed to her diffuse inflammatory process . 
PCP was [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) * * ] concern due to her unprophylaxed chronic steroid load of 3 0 mg prednisone daily , and indeed a beta glucan was positive , though this was felt to represent her candidida from her lung .

IMPRESSION : Left lung base atelectasis , but developing pneumonia cannot be excluded . 
PA and lateral may be helpful for further evaluation if clinically feasible . 
Brief Hospital Course : # Shock : Patient with hypotension requiring pressors at OSH ED with a lactate 2 . 1 . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] patient was responsive to IVF and weaned off levophed . 
Most likely septic given mild hypothermia , WBC 1 7 . 3 and neutrophilia , hypoxia , and CT chest finding c / w pneumonia . 
While it is possible that the leukocytosis may be secondary to prednisone , the prednisone may also be masking a fever . 
Treated empirically with vanc , zosyn with rapid improvment . 
There may have also been a component of hypovolemia in setting of decreased oral intake at [ * * Hospital 1 1 5 0 1 * * ] given response to IVF . 
Pt has only been on short taper of prednisone so less likely adrenal insufficiency although did receive hydrocortisone at OSH . 
Pt with elevated troponin but less likely cardiogenic shock - may more likely represent end organ damage from hypoperfusion ; no evidence of CHF and BP unlikely to reverse so quickly . 
He was never again hypotensive on the floor and his white count resolved with IV Abx . 
We were never 1 0 0 % convinced that this was from pneumonia and a foot CT was checked prior to discharge to r / o osteomyelitis which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis .

Plan going forward : - Complete 1 4 day course of broad spectrum abx ( last day [ * * 5 - 2 8 * * ] ) - Patient must have CXR in 1 month to f / u for complete resolution of his PNA / r / o underlying malignancy . 
This was likely related to pneumonia , though volume overload from resuscitation can not be excluded , or any contribution from his underlying lung disease . 
The patient peaked and ruled out on labs in house . 
EKG was paced and c / w prior . 
Per son , recent stress test unremarkable . 
Pt is on ASA and plavix but guaiac negative , no evidence of active bleeding . 
Concern for DIC in setting of sepsis although pt currently appears well . 
Patient drifted back up to 3 3 without intervention .

No acute inflammation concerning for gout although has been on prednisone . 
Pain unchanged per pt . 
He underwent CT foot to r / o osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis as a source , this instead showed evidence of pseudogout and osteoarthritis .

Brief Hospital Course : Ms . [ * * Known lastname 1 9 6 8 * * ] is a 7 6 F with DM , CAD , and h / o GIB who presents with GIB and CP . 
She was admitted to the MICU for monitoring . 
Hospital course is discussed below by problem : . 
Gastrointestinal bleed . 
The history of BRBPR was more suggestive of a lower source . 
A brisk upper bleed seemed less likely . 
Her baseline hct is 3 0 , and during this admission , it dropped to as low as 2 3 . 9 . 
She had small amounts of bright red blood in her stool , although nothing to explain the 6 point hematocrit drop . 
A central line was placed and she was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs during her six - day course in the unit . 
GI was consulted and performed both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy , although no source of active bleeding or old blood could be identified . 
The full reports are provided above . 
She was started on IV proton - pump inhibitor and her hematocrit stabilized in the low thirties on the fifth hospital day , and remained stable with stable vital signs . 
She was transferred to the floors on hospital day 6 , and her hematocrit followed twice daily . 
After transfer , she had no more bloody bowel movements . 
Her Plavix has been held , and her antihypertensives have also been held . 
She will follow - up in [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic with Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 1 3 5 6 * * ] in one week . 
Chest pain , coronary artery disease , history of CABG . 
She has chronic chest pain , and is on 2 anti - anginal medications . 
During this admission , she reported intermittent episodes of angina . 
EKGs did not show acute changes and cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative . 
Her ranolazine was continued but her Imdur and SL nitros held for concern of precipitating hypotension . 
She was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs to keep her hct above 2 5 . 
As above , we have held her Plavix and cardiovascular medicines at time of discharge given the recent GI bleed . 
Her blood pressure has been well - controlled , despite being off meds , with ranges in the 1 2 0 s - 1 4 0 s / 6 0 - 7 0 s . 
She will follow - up with her primary care where decision can be made regarding resumption of her Plavix and CV meds . 
Diabetes mellitus II . 
We held her oral hypoglycemics and kept her on sliding scale humalog insulin . 
She will resume her oral hypoglycemics after discharge . 
Hypertension . 
As above , her metoprolol , Cozaar , Imdur and triamterene / HCTZ were stopped in the setting of GI bleed . 
These can be resumed as outpatient if her blood pressure warrants additional meds , although during this admission her pressures have been relatively well - controlled without . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
We continued her outpatient simvastatin . 
Her diet was progressed as tolerated to diabetic , heart - healthy diet . 
Pneumoboots were used for venous thrombosis prophylaxis . 
Her code status is full code .

For treatment , he was started empirically on Unasyn on [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 4 - 2 6 * * ] and then changed to Zosyn on [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 4 - 2 9 * * ] . 
He also had a drain placed into one of his abdominal fluid collections . 
Additional issues include the following : - malnutrition - He was started on TPN in the setting of being NPO and with marked hypoalbuminemia with Alb 1 . 5 . 
He was initially started on diltiazem with minimal improvement , and he was then transitioned to amiodarone . 
A pigtail drain was placed [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 5 - 1 * * ] to drain ascitic fluid . 
He was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] Assessment for ERCP and possible transpapillary drainage with stenting . 
Finger stick glucose was elevated to 2 2 5 this afternoon .

MRCP [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 4 - 2 8 * * ] : 1 . 
Pancreatic head mass secondary to acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis , need to r / o underlying mass . 
Secondary mild diation of main PD 6 mm , unchanged from prior CT , no intra / extra hepatic biliary dilation . 
Mild GB distention w / o stones . 
Cirrhosis and moderate ascites . 
U / S [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 4 - 2 8 * * ] : Abdominal ascites with septations . 
Heterogeneous liver , nl spleen , no hydronephrosis , small bilat effusions . 
Edematous major papilla 2 . 
The bile duct was not dilated . 
The distal bile duct filled poorly , most likely due to extrinsic compression from the pathology at the pancreatic head . 
No filling defects were noted . 
Contrast was injected into the pancreatic duct , which appeared to terminate abruptly in the pancreatic head , with no filling beyond that point . 
This is in keeping with the reported MRCP findings and is concerning for an obstructing pancreatic mass . 
A 3 . 2 cm X 4 . 1 cm discrete anechoic lesion , consistent with a cyst was noted in the head of the pancreas . 
The walls of the cyst were thick measuring 0 . 2 2 cm . 
Layering debris was noted in the dependent part of the cyst . 
A pseudoaneurysm was noted on the lateral wall of the cyst . 
The cyst appeared to obstruct the main pancreatic duct , which was dilated distally . 
The cyst was also noted to compress the portal vein . 
A single perigastric lymph node was noted , which measured 1 . 8 x 0 . 8 cm . 
Multiple areas of fluid collection throughout the abdomen including the large bilobed pseudocyst above and below the pancreas , in the right paracolic gutter , transverse mesentery , and within anterior abdominal wall . 
There is also a 1 0 - mm aneurysm at the origin of the common hepatic artery . 
Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct due to compressive effect of the pseudocyst . 
Brief Hospital Course : 8 3 yo male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis . 
Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra - abdominal fluid collections thought related to his pseudocyst . 
His course was complicated by unexplained PEA arrest . 
The patient had an ICU course s / p resuscitation wherein he did not regain mental faculties or responsiveness . 
His family chose comfort measures and Mr . [ * * Known lastname 5 9 9 9 6 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) * * ] on [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 5 - 1 9 * * ] . 
Patient never regained mental faculties . 
Pancreatititis , Pancreatic Pseudocysts , Intra - abdominal fluid Collections On ERCP , patient was found to have bile duct filling defect , suggestive of external compression . 
He underwent follow - up EUS which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst . 
CTA Pancreas was also performed , which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal fluid collections . 
He was evaluated by our general surgery team , who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation was relatively immature , and that surgical intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated . 
He developed a bleeding GDA aneurysm and was taken to IR for embolization before which he developed PEA arrest . 
This GDA was ultimately embolized . 
Clostridium difficile infection Within 4 8 hours of admission , patient developed increased diarrhea and marked leukocytosis from 1 7 to 2 6 . 
He was C . diff positive and started on flagyl on [ * * 2 1 6 6 - 5 - 7 * * ] with improvement in his diarrhea . 
He was recommended to continue flagyl for 2 weeks from 4 / 7 - 2 0 / 1 0 . 
Hepatic Cirrhosis Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis , although patient has no history of this in the past . 
Atrial Fibrillation Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone . 
Upon transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the right atrium , and it was thought that this may have been triggering his atrial fibrillation . 
During his hospitalization at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , he remained in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control . 
His amiodarone was discontinued . 
Acute Renal Failure During his admission at the OSH , his creatinine was as high as 1 . 9 and then remained stable between . 
Malnutrition Patient was started on TPN at the OSH and was continued on this during his hospitalization . 
He was NPO during this hospitalization and was NPO on discharge . 
At rehab , we recommend that he remain NPO for the first week . 
He could take sips for comfort after this time . 
Anemia Unknown baseline . 
His hematocrit has remained stable during this admission from 2 7 - 3 0 . 
Hyperglycemia He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [ * * Hospital 3 2 5 3 5 4 * * ] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] .

Left ventricular hypertrophy . 
Diffuse non - specific ST - T wave changes . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and diffuse ST - T wave flattening have appeared . 
Diffuse non - specific ST - T wave flattening . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 8 - 1 * * ] no diagnostic interim change . 
Heart size is enlarged with the vascular pedicle more prominent than on [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 7 - 1 5 * * ] . 
There is an ill - defined opacificity overlying the right mid lung . 
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
New cardiomegaly and enlarged vascular pedicle , suggestive of fluid overload . 
Ill - defined opacity in the right mid lung could be pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical context . 
A blood sample was sent for type and screen . 
Jkb - antigen is a member of the Kidd blood group system . 
Jkb - antibody is clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions . 
During his last admission [ * * Date range ( 2 ) 8 5 4 8 7 * * ] , Mr . [ * * Known lastname 7 4 3 1 6 * * ] received 5 units of Jkb positive blood . 
These units will likely be cleared more quickly than Jkb negative units . 
The ICU team was made aware that delayed hemolysis could be taking place , although it will be difficult to assess in the face of his other lab abnormalities . 
In the future , Mr . [ * * Known lastname 7 4 3 1 6 * * ] should receive Jkb - antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions . 
Approximately 2 6 % of all ABO compatible blood will be Jkb - antigen negative . 
A wallet card and a letter stating the above will be sent to the patient . 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2 D or color Doppler . 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy . 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis ( LVEF = 4 0 - 4 5 % ) . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation . 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 7 - 9 * * ] , biventricular systolic function now appears mildly depressed . 
Proximally there are small nodular densities . 
There is mild basilar atelectasis , worse on the left . 
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . 
The visualized heart is normal in size with a trace pericardial effusion . 
Relative attenuation of the ventricles relative to muscle suggests anemia . 
Evaluation of the solid organs in the abdomen is limited without intravenous contrast . 
Calcific foci are seen within the liver and spleen suggesting prior granulomatous insult . 
A sliver of fluid is seen between the hepatic parenchyma and the gallbladder ( series 2 , image 2 5 ) . 
There is no pericholecystic fat stranding . 
The pancreas and adrenals appear normal . 
There is a 1 . 7 - cm diameter hypodensity within the lower pole of the left kidney and a second 1 . 2 - cm hypodensity in the interpolar region , incompetely characterized . 
Abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal without distension or pericolonic fat stranding . 
There is moderate fecal loading of the large bowel . 
The appendix is not clearly visualized , but there are no secondary signs to suggest appendicitis . 
There is no abdominal free air , free fluid , or pathologic lymphadenopathy . 
Pelvic loops of bowel appear normal . 
The bladder and distal ureters appear normal . 
The prostate measures to 5 cm . 
MUSCULOSKELETAL : There is no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion . 
Multilevel degenerative changes are seen with prominent Schmorl ' s nodes at L 3 - L 4 . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Sliver of pericholecystic fluid adjacent to the hepatic wall may reflect liver pathology rather than acute cholecystitis given no definitive gallbladder wall edema or adjacent fat stranding . 
Nonetheless recommend US for further characterization . 
Left renal cysts are incompletely characterized . 
These can be evaluated concurrently with gallbladder 3 . 
Left lower lobe septal thickening and proximal nodularity are consistent with focal edema and an inflammatory / infectious process . 
Moderate fecal loading . 
Enlarged prostate . 
Anemia . 
The echotexture of the liver is unremarkable except for a 1 . 1 - cm slightly hyperechoic lesion in segment VIII of the liver . 
A similarly hyperechoic region is seen more medially in segment VIII . 
This measures 1 . 3 cm . 
These areas do not demonstrate color flow consistent with hemangiomas . 
There is gallbladder wall edema ; however , the gallbladder is not distended . 
There are no stones in the gallbladder . 
No pericholecystic fluid is noted . 
The gallbladder wall edema causes wall thickening up to 6 . 5 mm . 
On color flow and Doppler images , there is normal flow in the main portal vein . 
Adequate flow is also identified in the left portal vein . 
There is normal flow visualized in the hepatic veins , although it was difficult to obtain waveforms as the patient was unable to hold his breath for a sufficiently long period of time . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Portal vein and its branches as well as hepatic veins are patent . 
Gallbladder wall edema , the presence of a non - distended gallbladder most consistent with hypoalbuminemia or liver disease . 
Too small hyperechoic lesions in the liver are most consistent with hemangiomas . 
Lungs are grossly clear except for a patchy area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region , which has slightly improved when compared to an earlier radiograph of 1 5 th at 5 : 4 3 a . m . 
This is most likely atelectasis and less likely an infectious pneumonia . 
Consider chest CT for confirmation and further characterization . 
The appearances of these abnormalities are similar to the previous CT with no newly affected areas . 
Pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion . 
Linear atelectasis is new and mild in the lower lobes bilaterally with thickening of the left major fissure due to mild atelectasis . 
Several lung cysts which were accentuated by the ground - glass opacities in the prior study are now separate to the lung abnormality ; these may represent sequelae of previous hemorrhage , i . e . 
Paraseptal emphysema is mild . 
The pulmonary artery is enlarged at 3 7 mm , slightly larger than on the previous study suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension . 
The caliber of the aorta and heart size is normal , no pericardial effusion . 
Relative hypodensity in the cardiac [ * * Doctor Last Name 1 7 5 4 * * ] in comparison to the myocardium suggests anemia . 
Although this examination was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation . 
Punctate calcification in the liver and spleen in addition to several calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggest prior granulomatous exposure . 
No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions are concerning for malignancy . 
These abnormalities appear to have cleared over several intervening chest radiographs and suggest recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage , particularly given the coexistent thrombocytopenia , other causes such as infection ( PCP ) are less likely . 
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration . 
There are fluid levels within the left maxillary , right frontal and bilateral sphenoid sinuses , as well as complete opacification of left frontal sinus . 
Aeration of the ethmoid air cells has improved since the prior study . 
Wall thickening in the sphenoid and possibly also frontal sinuses suggests chronic sinusitis . 
High - density material within the paranasal sinuses suggests inspissated secretions , hemorrhagic secretions , or fungal colonization . 
It is not clear whether there are postsurgical changes in the incompletely evaluated nasal cavity . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of other acute intracranial abnormalities . 
Chronic sinusitis . 
Fluid in the paranasal sinuses may indicate the presence of an acute component . 
High density contents within the sinuses may reflect inspissated secretions , hemorrhagic secretions , or fungal colonization . 
Pt was admitted with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia . 
He has had 4 days of ATG , which was stopped early due to neutropenia - he later received the 5 th dose when neutropenia resolved . 
Pt was also placed on high dose IV steriods , initially solumedrol 1 2 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] that were ultimately tapered to prednisone 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] by beginning of [ * * Month ( only ) 2 0 5 * * ] . 
Pt ended up getting two bone marrow biopsies ( [ * * 7 - 9 * * ] and [ * * 8 - 1 4 * * ] ) which both showed evidence of some hemophagycytosis . 
The liver biopsy on [ * * 8 - 8 * * ] showed no evidence of malignancy , necrosis , or infections . 
The pathology present was predominantly cholestatic and most consistent with drug induced changes . 
Pt was held off other chemotherapeutic regimens for the first 6 weeks of the hospitalization because of his combined renal failure and liver cholestasis . 
Once pt recovered renal function and was declared by nephrology to no longer required hemodialysis , he was started on low dose cyclosporine 5 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] on the evening of [ * * 8 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Initial trough value was very low ( < 3 0 ) two days later . 
His cyclosporine was gradually increased in dose with the most recent dose being 1 7 5 mg po BID . 
Cyclosporine goal trough is 1 5 0 - 2 0 0 and should next be checked on [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 9 - 2 * * ] and should be checked every 4 8 hrs . 
Lab results should be faxed every 4 8 hrs as soon as test results come back to Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 6 3 8 * * ] and to Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 8 5 4 8 8 * * ] [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 8 5 4 8 9 * * ] . 
Along with these you can fax CBC and chem 1 0 pls obtain as detailed on order sheet . 
Pt started on standing magnesium given cyclosporine results in magnesium wasting . 
Pt is also on predisone 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Throughout admission pt continued to show evidence of red cell and plt destruction on laboratory data ( hgb / plts would drift down , haptoglobin low , retics high ) . 
Initially numerous PRBC and platelet transfusions were needed to stabilize pt while in the ICU . 
Once he recovered enough to be on the floor , pt was intermittently given PRBCs when his Hct was low enough that there was concern for it causing symptoms . 
He only received plts on the floor one time per IR before they pulled out the HD catheter . 
No clear infectious source , possible liver or lung . 
Upon presentation pt was treated empirically with meropenem , levofloxacin from HAP with GN coverage since pt had been hospitalized and was on immunosuppression . 
He ultimately completed a 1 4 day course of meropenem . 
Culture data was ultimately all negative with the only positive micro test being a low CMV VL . 
ID started pt on Gancyclovir for ppx , and initial Acyclovir was stopped . 
Pt then suffered from neutropenia thought possible related to Gancyclovir vs ATG . 
Repeat CMV VLs were negative and Gancyclovir was stopped . 
Histo was negative so also okay to stop Ambisome . 
Pt had been on bactrim as an outpatient for PCP prophylaxis while on steroids , but this was changed to atovaquone due patients liver injury and concerns for bactrim involvement . 
Later in hospital course , pt was restarted on acyclovir for prophylaxis while on the steroids . 
Repeat CMV VL from [ * * 2 1 9 2 - 8 - 2 2 * * ] was positive for 1 , 6 3 0 copies and he was restarted on Valganciclovir 9 0 0 mg PO BID with a plan for 3 weeks of treatment total after discharge . 
His CBC will need to be monitored daily to look for neutropenia , but has remained stable after 4 days of treatment . 
Post extubation maintained oxygen sats on nasal cannula and then on room air . 
Throughout admission pt continued to have cough , occasionally productive , and somewhat congested chest , but no evidence of infection was found and pt was not treated with Abx for PNA after initial presentation . 
Pt has hx of asthma and was previously on Advair . 
So neb tx and advair were given throughout hospitalization . 
Pt had CT of chest for f / u of new poorly well - defined round opacities and right mid and left lower lung , concerning for infection such as septic emboli or fungal . 
CT scans shows areas of opacity overall improving when compared to prior image in [ * * Month ( only ) 1 1 6 * * ] . 
As per above , ID added Atovaquone for PCP [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) * * ] given that Bactrim can cause BM suppression and liver damage . 
This was likely related infection and respiratory distress . 
He was started on metoprolol 2 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] , he converted to sinus . 
Currently NSR . 
Metoprolol 2 5 mg PO BID was continued throughout admission although pt did not have any more incidences of documented afib while on hospital . 
Tbili slowly came down over course of the next month although ALT and Alk phos remained stably somewhat elevated . 
The LFT improvement that was noted initially dis seem to correlate with ATG treatment . 
Schistocytes previously seen on smear . 
Hemophagocytosis seen in BM . 
Pt was intermittently transfused as noted above when Hct would get around 2 1 or when there was concern that pt was getting symptomatic from his anemia . 
Epogen was given with HD while pt was on dialysis . 
Once dialysis was discontinued , it was given MWF ( 4 k units ) . 
As pt clinically stabilized , he was kept in the hospital by the concern that he continued to show evidence of red cell destruction . 
He was also transfused for liver biopsy . 
Once the patient was stable enough for the floor his plts ranged from 2 0 k - 8 0 k . 
On the floor he was transfused plts once when IR took out the HD cath , but otherwise his transfusion parameter was set at spontaneous bleeding . 
The exact etiology of the low plts was never completely clear but it is likely multifactorial and related to HLH , medications , and overall health . 
Counts quickly resolving after stopping offending meds . 
Once count improved pt was given last dose of ATG . 
Gancyclovir was kept off until [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] when a repeat CMV viral load was again suddenly positive . 
Low dose gancyclovir was restarted and WBC counts should be monitored daily . 
Pt was then swtiched to Galvancyclovir as per ID and his WBC have been monitored and have been stable . 
Pt did not need FFP . 
Pt was given vit K x 3 days early in admission . 
INR was stable around 1 for most of admission . 
This was stopped on [ * * 8 - 2 * * ] . 
He then had microfiltration on the same day to help with diureses for extubation . 
He was started on HD [ * * 8 - 4 * * ] . 
Stayed on HD until [ * * 8 - 1 8 * * ] with slow improvement of kidney function . 
After HD was stopped , Cr was observed for a few days and when it continued to show improvement down below 2 , and pt continued to make very good urine output , his HD line was pulled by IR on [ * * 8 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Renal followed throughout course of disease and helped manage electrolytes and guide HD therapy . 
His hyponatremia and autodiuresis is likely also related to poor glc control . 
He made up to 6 . 5 L of urine 3 days prior to discharge . 
PLEASE FLUID RESTRICT TO 2 . 5 L daily as his sodium improved with free water fluid restriction . 
He initially required Nitro drip for better BP control . 
This was discontinued quickly once control was achieved and he was restarted on his home dose of amlodipine 7 . 5 mg which was then increased dose to 1 0 mg Qday . 
HD also helped with BP control . 
Some additional control was provided by the metoprolol on which the patient was kept to control Afib . 
Managed with NPH of varying AM and PM doses with humalog ISS . 
Once tube feeds were stopped and oral intake restarted he again had to adjust NPH and ISS to keep sugars in an acceptable range . 
He is being discharged on NPH and an ISS . 
Pt had to be restrained with leather restraints for parts of two days because he was able to break out of the soft restraints despite his deconditioning . 
The first night this occurred pt had to be given haloperidol and ativan . 
Psych was then involved in care and recommended giving quitiapene QHs with extra prn doses as needed . 
Pt was on this regimen , with slow tapering of the QHs dose for the next two weeks , although delirium never again was an issue . 
Pt was intermittently mildly depressed about his body weakness and how long he had been in the hospital . 
This was thought to be related to prior pulmonary hemorrhage that is now resolving . 
Nodule will need follow - up as an outpatient after discharge . 
Head CT showed no IC bleeding or other acute process . 
HA resolved over next few days and was not an issue for the rest of admission . 
At each time EKGs were unremarkable and cardiac enzymes did not show evidence of acute MI ( although troponin was stably elevated in context of renal failure ) . 
Pt described pain as not unlike the GERD pain he occasionally had in the past , and both times pain seemed to resolve with a GI cocktail .

Emergent coronary bypass grafting x 3 on intra - aortic balloon pump with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery ; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the ramus intermedius coronary artery ; as well as reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to posterior left ventricular coronary artery . 
Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting . 
History of Present Illness : 6 0 year old gentleman with recent chest pain on exertion . 
Stress test was abnormal and he was scheduled for cath . 
Chest pain developed during cath today which revealed left main and multi - vessel coronary artery disease . 
He is now brought to the operating room urgently for CABG . 
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage . 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2 D or color Doppler . 
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and global systolic function are normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation . 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . 
IABP seen in the descending aorta with tip 2 cm below the left subclavian artery . 
Post - bypass : The patient is A paced . 
IABP remains in good position . 
Preserved Biventricular function . 
Aortic contours intact . 
Remaining exam is unchanged . 
All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam . 
This revealed significant left main and three vessel coronary artery disease . 
As he developed chest pain during his catheterization , an intra - aortic balloon pump was placed . 
The cardiac surgical service was urgently consulted and surgical revascularization was recommended . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname 1 0 1 4 2 6 * * ] was taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels . 
Please see operative note for details . 
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring . 
The next morning , his intra - aortic balloon pump was weaned off and removed without incident . 
He then awoke neurologically intact and was extubated . 
On postoperative day two , he developed a right pneumothorax following removal of his chest tubes . 
A right pleural tube was thus placed with resolution of his pneumothorax . 
Later on postoperative day two , he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery . 
He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight . 
After a water seal trial , the right pleural chest tube was removed and he subsequently developed a large right pneumothorax that required a chest tube to be reinserted . 
Follow up chest X - Ray revealed right lung rexpanded . 
This chest tube wsa pulled [ * * 7 - 1 9 * * ] without incident after clamping and serial CXR . 
The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility . 
Beta blockade , aspirin and a statin were resumed . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname 1 0 1 4 2 6 * * ] continued to make steady progress and was cleared by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 9 1 4 * * ] for discharge to home .

Due to his recent occipital strokes a CT scan was obtained prior to the administration of heparin . 
The CT scan showed bilateral occipital lobe hypodensities , right larger than left , unchanged from prior studies . 
Neurology was consulted and a heparin gtt was started at a low rate . 
A few hours after the heparin was started he began to complain of new visual hallucinations that he did not have before . 
Due to concerns for hemorrhagic conversion of his prior CVA he was transferred to the ICU for monitoring and a head CT was obtained that showed areas of subacute infarction in the occipital lobes bilaterally , unchanged since [ * * 2 1 5 4 - 2 - 2 6 * * ] with evolving hemorrhage within the infarctions . 
His heparin gtt was immediately stopped and 2 more follow up head CTs showed no change . 
An EEG was obtained and this show signs of encephalopathy but no seizure activity . 
His hallucinations continued and Keppra [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] was started .

Pertinent Results : [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 5 - 1 9 * * ] CT Head : IMPRESSION : There are two rim - enhancing lesions peripherally located within the right frontal lobe , as described above , with associated vasogenic edema and mass effect . 
The inferior lesion demonstrates a punctate focus of hemorrhage . 
While the superior lesion does abut the dura , it lacks characteristic dural tail , making meningioma a less likely consideration . 
Moreover , the more inferior lesion does appear intra - axial on coronal and sagittal reformatted images . 
Differential diagnosis includes metastatic disease versus abscess . 
Two enhancing right frontal lesions most consistent with metastases with surrounding vasogenic edema and right frontal sucal effacment . 
CT Torso : 1 . 
No definite evidence of malignancy . 
Consolidation within the superior segment of the left lower lobe may represent infection , but there is a slightly more rounded appearance inferiorly , and consider repeat chest CT following treatment . 
Prominent left - sided intrapulmonary lymph nodes may be reactive . 
Gallbladder sludge . 
Gas tracking in the posterior subcutaneous tissues and extending into the left paraspinal musculature and left psoas muscle . 
Findings are likely related to pressure erosion .

History of Present Illness : Ms . [ * * Known lastname 1 1 1 2 3 0 * * ] is a 5 3 - year - old G 4 , P 4 - 0 - 0 - 4 perimenopausal Caucasian female with bigeminy arrhythmia , depression , GERD , and is S / P C / S x 4 plus LTL . 
Ms . [ * * First Name ( Titles ) 1 1 1 2 3 1 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 1 8 3 4 * * ] a pelvic ultrasound [ * * 1 2 / 2 1 7 9 * * ] for complaints of abnormal bleeding . 
It revealed a 7 . 7 cm right posterior cul - de - sac cyst separate from the right ovary and a 3 . 5 cm simple left ovarian cyst . 
The uterus measured 1 0 . 9 cm but was otherwise unremarkable with endometrial stripe of 8 mm . 
She had a followup pelvic ultrasound ( [ * * 2 1 8 0 - 2 - 2 * * ] ) that revealed resolution of the 7 . 7 cm posterior cul - de - sac cyst with a normal right adnexa . 
She had two left ovarian cysts sizing 2 - 2 . 5 cm . 
Endometrial stripe measured 1 . 1 cm with a questionable 6 - mm endometrial polyp . 
In regards to her endometrial lesion and abnormal bleeding , she [ * * Year ( 4 digits ) 1 8 3 4 * * ] an office endometrial biopsy ( [ * * 2 1 8 0 - 1 - 1 8 * * ] ) . 
It revealed scant inactive endometrium with no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy . 
A diagnostic office hysteroscopy ( [ * * 2 1 8 0 - 4 - 1 9 * * ] ) revealed a normal endometrial cavity with no evidence of any endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids . 
There were no active issues regarding the endometrial findings and the patient maintained expectant management . 
In regards to her abnormal bleeding , given the benign endometrial biopsy and normal hematocrit , the patient opted to maintain expectant management . 
In regards to her pelvic and left ovarian cysts , it appeared that the patient had remained asymptomatic and this was an incidental finding . 
The large 7 . 7 cm right posterior cul - de - sac cyst had resolved spontaneously and the left adnexal cyst appeared to be oscillating in size and simple in nature . 
Therefore , the patient opted to maintain expectant management with intermittent surveillance given her asymptomatic state . 
She recently had a pelvic ultrasound at [ * * Location ( un ) 6 2 0 * * ] under Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 4 5 1 0 * * ] ( PCP ) instructions . 
PUS ( [ * * 2 1 8 2 - 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] ) at [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] [ * * Location ( un ) 6 2 0 * * ] reveals a uterus measuring 1 1 x 4 . 2 x 6 cm . 
Endometrial stripe measured 7 mm . 
No endometrial polyp was appreciated . 
The right ovary measured 3 cm in its greatest dimension with a large 8 . 9 x 4 cm cyst containing some debris . 
There was additionally a smaller 1 . 3 cm nodule within it . 
A third cystic area with flow was also noted along the edge of this large cystic lesion . 
On the left , the left ovary measured 5 cm in its greatest dimension and contained a 2 . 2 cm simple cyst . 
There was an additional 1 . 1 - cm solid nodule & a small amount of free fluid in the cul - de - sac . 
She denied any symptoms related to these PUS findings such as pelvic pain . 
On review of her menstrual pattern , she does report a pattern of oligomenorrhea consistent with perimenopause . 
She did skip her menses in [ * * 4 - / 2 1 8 2 * * ] , [ * * 5 - / 2 1 8 2 * * ] , and [ * * 6 - / 2 1 8 2 * * ] and has then resumed monthly menses in [ * * Month ( only ) 2 0 5 * * ] with each episode lasting roughly five to eight days . 
The amount of bleeding is lighter than her prior moderate to heavy flow noted two years ago . 
The patient continues to remain asymptomatic . 
Given the size of the lesions and the solid components , I advised surgical management even though she remains asymptomatic . 
After careful consideration , the patient would like to proceed with surgical evaluation . 
A plan for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo - oophorectomies with possible conversion to laparotomy was discussed . 
Pelvic peritoneal washings will be obtained . 
We also discussed the need for a staging procedure should surgical findings reveal a malignant condition . 
The patient was consented for a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo - oophorectomies , pelvic peritoneal washings , possible laparotomy , and possible staging procedure . 
She understands that a staging procedure will be performed by one of our gynecologic - oncologist here at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] if indicated ( greatly appreciated ) . 
The nature of the surgery , potential surgical risks , likely hospital and postoperative course were discussed with the patient in detail today .

He developed throbbing frontal occipital headache eyes and dry mouth and the headache was alleviated only slightly with ibuprofen . 
About one day later , the patient developed diffuse myalgia , began having shaking chills , and noted an intense erythema over both legs and injected conjunctivae and sclerae . 
These symptoms persisted over three days and patient returned from vacation .

A lumbar puncture revealed 2 white blood cells , no red blood cells , protein of 3 1 , glucose of 5 3 in cerebrospinal fluid . 
Because of his shortness of breath and to rule out pneumonia as the source of his symptoms , a chest x - ray was performed showing no cardiopulmonary process . 
The next day , his cough increased as well as his shortness of breath , and he became hypoxic . 
His 0 2 saturation dropped to 8 5 % on five liters . 
Another chest x - ray was done showing now an acute interstitial and valvular pulmonary edema . 
The heart size now was borderline with diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema . 
Predominantly perihilar air space opacities and small bilateral pleural effusions . 
Induced sputums were performed and the patient was started on intravenous Bactrim and prednisone for a possible PCP infection and levofloxacin for any community - acquired pneumonia . 
An echocardiogram was also performed showing an ejection fraction of over 6 5 % with normal left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size and systolic function . 
As the patient continued to worsen and became increasingly hypoxic , he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on day two of his hospital stay . 
Blood cultures , urine cultures , stool cultures were obtained , but were all negative . 
The patient was also feeling increasingly anxious and was given morphine , pantoprazole , zolpidem , and heparin . 
On day three of his hospital stay , the patient had to be intubated due to increasing hypoxia and respiratory distress . 
Another chest x - ray now showed a worsening in aeration . 
The previously noted pulmonary edema , which had predominated in the central lung zone , appeared to have extended into more peripheral portions of both hemithoraces . 
It was consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome and possibly superimposed pneumonia . 
The patient was sedated through Fentanyl , lorazepam and also received nicotine . 
On day five of his hospital stay , hematocrit dropped to 2 6 . 7 . 
He had not stooled and laboratory findings were not significant for hemolysis ; therefore , an abdominal CT scan was performed to rule out retroperitoneal bleeding . 
The CT showed evidence of bilateral pneumonia aspiration , mild pleural effusions , but no focal consolidations and no retroperitoneal bleeding . 
To identify the source of his infection , a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed but viral culture was negative . 
Influenza antigens A and B were negative .

HCV antibody negative . 
HIV antibody positive . 
Stool cultures showed no ova or parasites . 
No Cryptosporidium , no Giardia , no polymorphonucleocytes . 
C . difficile was repeatedly negative . 
As Bactrim has been described to be associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome , Bactrim was discontinued on day five of hospital stay . 
Within the next three days , the patient improved , still had fevers , but could be put on a spontaneous breathing ventilator on day eight of his hospital stay and extubated on day nine . 
The skin signs markedly improved and his 0 2 saturation on hospital day nine was now 9 8 % on four liters of oxygen / nasal cannula . 
On day ten of his hospital stay , the patient developed withdrawal symptoms consisting of agitation , hallucinations and tachypnea , which could be attributed to the high doses of Fentanyl he had received . 
The patient was transferred to the Medicine Floor on day ten of his hospital stay . 
A chest x - ray showed no significant changes to previous ones . 
The patient remained to be anxious and agitated . 
He also still had hallucinations and an oral thrush could be observed and treated with Nystatin . 
He continued to have diarrhea , but his stool cultures remained negative . 
Blood cultures were drawn and were still pending . 
On day 1 2 of his hospital stay , the patient was started on Dapsone for PCP prophylaxis , but the patient developed a rash on both arms and the back again . 
As Dapsone is known to show a cross reactivity to Bactrim in [ * * 1 0 - 2 0 * * ] % , Dapsone was discontinued . 
Patient continued to have fevers and further blood cultures were drawn which are still pending . 
On day 1 4 of his hospital stay , all medications except prednisone and the nicotine patch were discontinued . 
The patient was seen by Physical Therapy and started to walk around the floor . 
Diarrhea seemed to have gotten better . 
His temperatures remained at low grade . 
On day 1 5 of his hospital stay , the patient was discharged . 
Blood cultures will have to be followed up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] , with whom he has an appointment within two weeks and a Infectious Disease Consult for starting of HAART and PCP [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) 1 1 0 2 * * ] .

Physical Exam : vitals : BP 1 1 4 / 6 8 , P - 1 0 6 , R - 2 0 and T - 9 7 gen - old male appears stated age ; lethrgic on exam and answers questions with " yes / no " appropriately ; oriented to person and place ; speech is mildly slurred with word finding difficulty heent - clear OP ; no conjunctival palor cv - regular rate with a normal S 1 , S 2 . 
No m / g or rub apparent on exam . 
Worsening vasogenic edema and midline shift ( subfalcine heriation ) secondary to large known GBM . 
There is similar effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventrical , although the degree of subfalcine herniation has increased . 
There is increased sulcal effacement of the suprasellar cistern and ambient cisterns on the left , indicating progressive left uncal herniation with early transtentorial migration . 
Hypodensity within the left cerebral peduncle , likely corresponds to signal abnormality noted on MRI from [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 3 - 1 6 * * ] . 
MRI BRAIN ( [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 4 - 2 0 * * ] ) : New left to right subfalcine and left uncal herniation associated with a dramatic increase in peritumoral edema surrounding a left temporal lobe lesion . 
The lesion itself is only slightly increased in size . 
Slow diffusion in small focal areas in this lesion suggests infarction . 
However , focal areas of necrosis may produce this effect . 
Enhancement and FLAIR signal hyperintensity along the sulci in the left cerebral hemisphere are concerning for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . 
This finding makes associated radiation necrosis less likely . 
If clinically indicated , MR perfusion and Spectroscopy imaging could be performed . 
CTX ( [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 4 - 2 0 * * ] ) : Increase in the right pleural effusion and / or adjacent atelectasis . 
Otherwise , unchanged appearance of the post - surgery chest .

Astrocytoma : The CT of his demonstrated increasing midline shift along with increasing edema likely accounting for the majority of his symptoms . 
Steroid dose had been tapered recently given the patient ' s steroid myopathy . 
Given this , he was given 1 0 mg IV decadrom in the emergency room with continuation of IV steroids thereafter . 
He was seen by neurosurgery and taken to the OR on [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 4 - 2 1 * * ] for left temporal craniotomy for tumor debulking . 
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications . 
The patient was taken to the trauma ICU overnight for close monitoring of his neuro status and blood pressure . 
PRN hydralazine was used to keep SBP < 1 4 0 . 
A repeat CT showed " interval decompression and improvement in the amount of mass effect , midline shift , subfalcine herniation , and effacement of the left suprasellar and ambient cisterns " and the patient remained without headache or nausea / vomiting . 
His speach aphasic and his right - sided weakness was stable to mildly improved . 
He was seen by physical and occupational therapy and they felt he would benefit from rehab . 
Steroid Myopathy : Patient had a history of steroid induced myopathy and had presented with an ongoing steroid taper . 
Given the amount of edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this , steroids were increased at the time of admission and were continued ; upon discharge , plan was for a steroid taper . 
As above , both PT and OT were consulted . 
DVT : Patient had recent history of DVT , diagnosed [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 4 - 1 4 * * ] .

IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS . 
PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION . 
Piperacillin / tazobactam sensitivity testing available on request . 
Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen prior to valvuloplasty . 
Mild ( 1 + ) aortic regurgitation is seen after valvuloplasty . 
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae . 
Moderate ( 2 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
KUB ( [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 7 * * ] ) : 1 . 
No evidence of obstruction or ileus . 
No evidence of free air on these supine radiographs . 
CT HEAD ( [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 8 * * ] ) IMPRESSION : Left parietal hypodensity extends to the cortex and has an appearance of subacute infarct of few days ' duration . 
However , clinical correlation recommended . 
Additionally , the presence of a slower than normal background with bursts of generalized slowing is consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy of toxic , metabolic , or anoxic etiology . 
CTA HEAD / NECK ( [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 1 1 * * ] ) IMPRESSION : Subacute - appearing infarct with some blood products in the left parietal lobe . 
No acute infarct is seen . 
No mass effect or hydrocephalus . 
Note is made of decreased flow void in the right cavernous carotid artery . 
IMPRESSION : Right internal carotid artery has markedly diminished flow . 
The internal carotid was described to be normal on a previous duplex ultrasound on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 7 - 1 5 * * ] . 
Axial source images do not give appearance of a dissection , but further evaluation with CTA is recommended after consideration of patient ' s renal insufficiency . 
MPRESSION : Diminished flow signal in the right cavernous and petrous carotid could be due to occlusion or markedly slow flow . 
CAROTID U / S ( [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 1 3 * * ] ) Right - nice brisk upstoke , minimal diastolic flow , diminuitive ICA and potential dissection versus intracranial carotid disease - CTA and clinical correlation is suggested . 
Brief Hospital Course : 7 1 M with AS ( 0 . 8 ) and One vessel CAD p / w resp . 
He is presently hypotensive , tachycardic and profoundly hypoxic . 
ACUTE ISSUES : # Hypoxia - Patient arrived intubated after presenting to OSH with SOB . 
Bilateral pulm infiltrates were severe and most radiologically c / w pulm edema . 
However , the patient had fluid responsive tachycardia and a low CVP ( through the PICC ) . 
His resp distress progressed despite lasix diuresis at NVMC . 
Accordingly , initial differential included ARDS from sepsis ( see below ) , DAD , multifocal pna , flash pulmonary edema and daptomycin pneumonitis . 
He was ventilated with ARDSnet settings . 
Pt was able to be weaned to minimal ventilator settings by day 8 of intubation . 
However , extubation was delayed due to pt ' s mental status . 
Despite holding sedation for several days , pt remained non - responsive . 
He was successfully extubated on day 1 1 of intubation . 
He successfully transitioned from nasal canula to room air and has an oxygen saturation of 9 7 - 1 0 0 % on room air at time of discharge . 
Tachycardia improved with fluid boluses supporting poor preload . 
Differential also included cardiac event , sepsis , PEEP effect and propofol . 
Fluids and pressors were administered with goal MAP > 6 0 . 
Palliative valvuloplasty was attempted . 
TTE showed post - valvuloplasty aortic valve area of 0 . 8 cm 2 . 
He was pan - cultured and initially continuted on vancomycin ( gentomycin was held given [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] ) . 
He was successfully weaned off pressors and maintained MAP > 6 5 . 
In interim , pt developed [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] that was attributed to gentamycin toxicity . 
Dapto / gent was discontinued and he was started on vancomycin ( vanc sensitivity MIC of 2 ) . 
Infectious Disease team was consulted and per their recommendations , vancomycin was discontinued due to risk of increasing kidney injury . 
Pt was resumed again on daptomycin . 
Blood cultures remained negative during this hospitalization . 
He is to complete a 6 week course of daptomycin for bacteremia ( should be discontinued around [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 2 8 * * ] - however exact date of discontinuation should decided at follow - up ID appointment on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 2 0 * * ] ) . 
A UA demonstrated pyuria , and he grew Proteus resistant to cipro but sensitive to ceftriaxone . 
He was started on ceftriaxone 1 gm daily for a 1 4 day course which should be completed on [ * * 2 1 2 0 - 8 - 2 9 * * ] . 
He was rate controlled with IV and PO metoprolol . 
He was loaded with amiodarone and was started on anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin . 
He spontaneously converted back to sinus rhythm and has remained in sinus for several days without any recurrence of afib . 
He was taken off heparin drip once INR was theraputic at 2 . 0 - 3 . 0 . 
He should be continued on amio 4 0 0 mg PO daily for 1 week , and then decreased to maintenance dose of amio 2 0 0 mg PO daily . 
His INR has been theraputic on coumadin 5 mg PO daily . 
Pt ' severe respiratory distress was thought to be due to volume overload so CVVH was initiated . 
There were issues of kinking with the CVVH catheter and the line had to be replaced two times in order to achieve adequate flow . 
Pt tolerated CVVH well with only one episode of hypotension thought to be related to excessive fluid shifts during the CVVH . 
CVVH was discontinued on [ * * 8 - 5 * * ] when pt began putting out good urine to IV Lasix . 
By the end of his stay , pt was euvolemic , his creatinine was trending down and he no longer required lasix . 
He was inconsistently responsive to painful stimuli and failed to respond to simple commands even though he had been quite alert and interactive prior to his hospitalization . 
This altered mental status was initially attributed to oversedation during intubation so sedation was withheld for several days without any improvement in mental status . 
Concern was then raised for ischemic stroke given his recent episodes of atrial fibrillation ( see below ) . 
On exam , it was noticed that he seemed to had clonus on his right side and appeared to have gaze preference to the left . 
Neurology was consulted who recommended a CT Head and MRI / MRA of the Head . 
CT Head showed left parietal hypodensity extending to the cortex with an appearance of subacute infarct of few days ' duration . 
Follow - up MRI / MRA confirmed these findings but also showed diminished flow in the right ICA . 
F / u ultrasound of the carotids demonstrated intracranial dissection on the right but per vascular surgery , no intervention is needed and he can follow - up with vascular surgery in six months for interval evaluation of any changes . 
However , he should be further evaluated with CTA once his renal function improves . 
Most likely etiology of the stroke is thrombus dislodged during valvuloplasty or during pt ' s episodic episodes of atrial fibrillation . 
After patient was successfully extubated , his mental status improved significantly . 
He was alert and able to follow commands consistently . 
He had a tremor in his face and extremities ( though this was present at baseline ) and pt has an expressive aphasia , able to answer questions only in short sentences . 
Per neurology , pt is now exhibiting symptoms of Parkinsonism but would defer treatment at this point . 
He required insulin drip to manage his sugars . 
CHRONIC ISSUES : # Aortic stenosis : Prior to admission pt was being evaluated for CoreValve procedure , however evalution was complicated by enterococcus infection . 
Because of hypotension on presention , palliative valvuloplasty was attempted but was not successful because of technical difficulties . 
Post - valvuloplasty aortic area was 0 . 8 cm 2 . 
Volume status was monitored closely during admission because pt is very preload depended . 
Even if deemed an appropriate candidate , he will not be eligable for CoreValve for at least 6 months now given acute CVA . 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES : He remained full code this admission . 
Acute parietal infarct has left pt with many residual deficits and will require intense rehab and close follow - up with many specialties . 
Medications on Admission : 1 . furosemide 8 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO DAILY ( Daily ) .

She was admitted to the CCU on [ * * 2 1 3 6 - 7 - 1 8 * * ] . 
Likely etiology is ATN ( muddy - brown casts ) . 
Pt ' s daughter reporting poor urine output at home . 
There was no suspicion of obstructive physiology . 
The Patient ' s fluid status was initially unclear . 
She appeared to be dry and was given fluid however she did not make urine appropriate to the fluid bolus . 
She became fluid overloaded and diuresis was attempted . 
She did not respond well to Lasix and continued to retain fluid . 
Nephrology was consulted and recommended holding Lasix and that the only remaining treatment options for her was dialysis . 
Lasix drip was attempted for fluid removal as family did not want to put patient on dialysis . 
The patient ' s creatinine continued to rise and was 4 . 1 on [ * * 7 - 2 9 * * ] . 
Originally report was that pt had a Troponin of 3 0 at [ * * Year ( 4 digits ) 1 6 9 6 2 * * ] . 
However , trop T on admission was 1 . 4 0 . 
Elevated enzymes could have been due to a cardiac event but it was felt that the patient was a poor candidate for any intervention . 
ECG was unchanged and the patient was without cardiac symptoms . 
Cardiac enzymes trended down over admission . 
Last echo with EF 1 5 - 2 0 % . 
The pati net initially received fluid boluses to help determine etiology of renal failure , however she was unable to remove volume and not candidate for dialysis . 
Patient comfort made main goal of therapy . 
Her Pacer rate increased to attempt to help cardiac output however this did not have an effect on urine output . 
Baseline HCT 3 4 - 3 8 but was noted to be 2 2 on admission . 
Likely etiology is from suspected bleed - in the area of the L . thigh , likely spontaneous in the setting of supratherapeutic INR . 
CT abd / pelvis / L . thigh ruled out RP and rectus sheath bleed , thigh hematoma seen . 
The patient was not transfused blood as hematocrit stabilized and patient already in heart failure . 
It was felt that the patient ' s renal failure required dialysis and the family was clear that this was not a therapy they wished to pursue . 
It was agreed that patient would stop medications that were only present because of long term benefit and that patient comfort would be the goal of care . 
Patient moving towards CMO , no oral medications and the patient was started on Dilaudid for pain control . 
She was continued on telemetry for family comfort . 
Over the next 3 days , the patient ' s mental status declined and she became less responsive . 
On [ * * 8 - 1 * * ] , the patient was surrounded by her daughters and care givers when she was noted to become asystolic .

No evidence of extravasation , blush , or aneurysms could be noticed . 
All bronchial arteries and branches presented with very small caliber . 
No embolization was attempted via the right bronchial intercostal trunk due to supply of midline arteries , likely directed towards the spine . 
A CT of the chest revealed non - specific multi - focal ground glass opacities , particularly in the right lung , and bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of several airway segments to the right upper and middle lobes . 
The patient was observed in the ICU because of the large volume hemoptysis . 
He underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional pulmonology , but they were unable to visualize the source of the bleeding because of the large amount of blood in the right upper lobe . 
He underwent IR angiography , but they were not able to visualize the vessel because it was not actively bleeding . 
The patient was transferred to the general medical floor post - procedure where he continued to have small volume hemoptysis . 
Interventional radiology repeated the angiography but was unable to embolize an artery because there was no active bleed . 
The patient underwent a second bronchoscopy on [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 9 - 2 6 * * ] , where a clot was found to be nearly occluding the right upper lobe ; the clot was not removed for concern of re - activating the original bleed . 
His plavix was held since admission , and his hematocrit remained stable in the low 3 0 s after an initial drop from Hct 4 2 in the ED . 
The patient did not require any blood transfusions . 
He did get one unit of platelets transfused , per surgical recommendations , to provide him with more functional platelets in the setting of recent Plavix use . 
The patient was seen and evaluated by Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] of Thoracic Surgery who felt that the risk of Right upper lobectomy was higher than the risk of significant re - bleeding at this time . 
No tumors or cavitary lesions were noted on the CT scan from admission . 
His plavix was discontinued because his stents were placed about four years ago . 
Upon discharge , he was started on Aspirin 8 1 mg every other day , per recommendation of his outpatient cardiologist .

Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to the hospital because you were coughing blood . 
Because of the large volume of blood you initially coughed up , you were monitored in the Intensive Care Unit then transferred to the general medical floor when stable . 
As you know , you were found to have a a blood clot in the right upper lobe of your lung , which was likely the site of your bleeding . 
Duirng your hospitalization , you had two bronchoscopies to visualize the lung and two procedures by Intervential Radiology to attempt to find the source of your bleeding . 
Emphysema changes were seen as well in your lungs on CT from your history of smoking . 
You also had Pulmonary Function Testing ( PFTs ) done to test your lung function in case you may need surgery on your lungs . 
Please follow up with your Primary Care Physician regarding the pulmonary function tests and the emphysematous changes in your lungs . 
As discussed with Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] , you will be discharged from the hospital in stable condition . 
The risks of surgical removal of your right upper lung lobe were thought to be greater than the risk of significant re - bleeding at this time . 
You will follow up with Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] in 2 weeks for re - imaging of your chest . 
The following changes were made to your medications : - Please STOP taking Plavix .

Then transferred to the oncology service on [ * * 8 - 8 * * ] for initiation of chemotherapy . 
His hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds after failing a swallow evaluation . 
On [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 8 - 1 9 * * ] , he received 1 0 mg olanzapine for nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed fever , hypotension , acute kidney injury , and ultimately transfered to the ICU [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 8 - 2 0 * * ] for sepsis and neutropenic fever . 
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia , hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [ * * 3 - 8 * * ] limited PO intake / diarrhea vs . sepsis , improvement in acute renal failure , hypernatremia . 
He has had frequent atrial ectopy and PVCs and electrolyte abnormalities . 
ENT planned for tracheostomy [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 8 - 2 8 * * ] for airway protection during therapy , but on [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 8 - 2 8 * * ] early AM , he was found to have left facial droop . 
MRI confirmed CVA suggestive of thromboembolism . 
TTE showed no evidence of clot . 
Neuro recommended starting heparin ggt , which was started [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 8 - 2 9 * * ] . 
TEE could not be done given size / location of hypopharyngeal mass . 
Repeat TTE with bubble study revealed a PFO and LE doppler U / S showed a RLE DVT . 
The tracheostomy was eventually placed [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 9 - 1 0 * * ] . 
However , this was complicated by bleeding over one week . 
Anticoagulation was stopped as a result . 
A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site . 
He has subsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylactic heparin 5 , 0 0 0 units SC TID . 
On [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 9 - 2 4 * * ] he coughed out his tracheostomy cannula . 
Replacement was complicated by bleeding and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation . 
Bleeding / hemoptysis resolved gradually over next 4 days . 
He again developed aspiration pneumonia [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 9 - 2 8 * * ] and was started on cefepime and vancomycin .

Combination XRT and cetuximab was planned . 
A loading dose ( 4 0 0 mg / m 2 ) of cetuximab was given [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 1 0 - 3 * * ] and radiation started [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] and will continue for 6 weeks total . 
MICU COURSE : Mr . O ' [ * * Known lastname * * ] was admitted to MICU For airway monitoring after trach placement . 
Trach placement was uncomplicated . 
On admission , he was breathing comfortably and in no distress . 
Post - op CXR was performed , which showed pneumomediastinum ; this was not unexpected given recent open procedure . 
Repeat CXR showed no change in pneumomediastinum . 
Post - op trach care was administered including airway suctioning as needed . 
Tube feeds were re - initiated with additional boluses of free water given hypernatremia . 
Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU course because of bleeding from suction . 
However , bleeding was limited , so enoxaparin was restarted in the morning of MICU day 2 . 
Ophthalmology was consulted for continuing care of VZV ; they recommended continuing acyclovir . 
He remained hemodynamically stable and returned to the primary team . 
OTHER DETAILS : # Cough : CXR negative . 
Cough may be due to XRT .

Discharge Condition : Mental Status : Clear and coherent . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair . 
Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor in your throat ( hypopharynx ) . 
A G - tube for tube feeding and a port for chemotherapy were placed . 
The tumor biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma ( cancer ) and you were transferred to the Oncology floor to start chemotherapy . 
MRI of the brain did not show any cancer in the brain . 
Video swallow evaluation showed severe aspiration of food and liquids . 
You cannot eat or drink until this is re - evaluated . 
All of your nutrition must come through tube feeds . 
Tube feeds were started and you developed high blood sugars managed with insulin . 
Chemotherapy was difficult to tolerate . 
You needed several different types of anti - nausea medications . 
All of your blood counts became very low from the chemotherapy . 
You developed fevers and pneumonia that were treated in the Intensive Care Unit with IV antibiotics . 
You also developed a stroke with left - sided weakness . 
The stroke likely originated from a blood clot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and passed through a hole in the heart ( patent foramen ovale ) and then into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage . 
You were started on a blood thinner for this . 
To prevent difficulty breathing from future radiation therapy , a tracheostomy was placed . 
However , this was complicated by bleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted . 
You also developed a rash on your left forehead . 
Culture confirmed this was shingles . 
You were treated with an anti - viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for it . 
You developed recurrent pneumonia and were started on IV antibiotics . 
You coughed out your trach tube , but this was replaced . 
You started daily radiation treatment [ * * 1 0 - 1 0 * * ] , Monday through Friday for 6 weeks . 
You will also be treated with weekly cetuximab immunotherapy during your radiation . 
Your first dose was on [ * * 2 1 0 8 - 1 0 - 3 * * ] . 
As radiation therapy continues , your cough may worsen and require more suctioning . 
TRANSITION ISSUES : 1 . 
You will return to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for daily radiation therapy , Monday to Friday , for 6 weeks . 
You will receive weekly cetuximab infusion therapy weekly until radiation therapy is completed . 
You will be going to a rehab center for physical therapy .

Pertinent Results : - [ * * 5 - 1 6 * * ] : CT [ * * Last Name ( un ) 1 0 3 * * ] / pelvis - multiple bilateral mostly non - displaced rib fractures with bilateral atelectatic change in ground glass changes of the right upper lobe . 
No pneumothorax . 
Interval development of large perisplenic hematoma - tracks along the LUQ , subdiaphragmatic space and along the stomach . 
On HD # 1 , his serial HCTs were [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 3 0 3 6 3 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] a repeat CT AP was obtained which showed extension of hematoma . 
He was transfused 1 unit PRBC + 1 U FFP . 
In addition , his home digoxin restarted . 
On HD # 2 , his diet was advanced to regular . 
Due to fluid overload , he was started on a lasix drip with improvement in his respiratory status . 
For pain control , an epidural was attempted but could not be placed . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 0 * * ] , however , a repeat attempt at placement was successful with marked improvement in his pain . 
Over the previous days he was quite delirious which greatly improved with placement of the epidural , improved pain control and cessation of narcotics . 
Heparin sc was started . 
EP interrogated his pacemaker and discovered no fires or arrhythmias . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 1 * * ] , his lasix changed from drip to home PO dose . 
Mental status continued to improve but he was kept in the ICU as he had been so recently delirious . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 2 * * ] , the patient had continued stable hematocrit checks , was tolerating a regular diet and A & O x 2 - 3 , so he was transferred to the surgical floor . 
Epidural infusing bupivicaine only , no narcotic related to prior confusion . 
His epidural infusion was stopped on [ * * 5 - 2 3 * * ] in preparation for removal . 
Foley replaced [ * * 5 - 2 2 * * ] after inability to void after foley removed . 
Evaluated by occupational therapy to determine need for rehabilitation and to assess his cognitive ability . 
He was re - evaluated on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] and it was determined at that time that he was safe to go home . 
He will still need cognitive evaluation in 1 month related to his head injury . 
His atrial fibrillation has been controlled with medications . 
He is tolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea or vomitting . 
He is afebrile and his vital signs are stable . 
He is alert , oriented , and conversant . 
His home medications have been resumed except for his coumadin . 
He has resumed his diuretics , last creatinine 1 . 7 . 
He is voiding without difficulty . 
He is preparing for discharge home with instructions to follow - up with the acute care service in 2 weeks and cognitive neurology in 1 month . 
Will need to be addressed by his primary care provider [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] [ * * 3 - 2 8 * * ] days . 
Crestor 5 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO at bedtime . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
You were intially admitted to the intensive care unit for monitoring , but have been managed on the general surgical floor . 
Your rib pain had been controlled with an epidural catheter . 
Your pain has diminished and you are now on oral analgesics . 
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician . 
In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake . 
This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs . 
You can schedule this appointment by calling # [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 6 0 0 * * ] . 
Please follow up with your Primary care provider [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] [ * * 3 - 2 8 * * ] days regarding resuming your coumadin . 
Please follow up with Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] , cognitive neurology , in 1 month . 
Apparently he has had guaiac positive stools and has undergone a colonoscopy with the identification of four polyps . 
Three have been removed and he then had a GI bleed . 
This has been reevaluated and he has been stable . 
The fourth polyp will need to be removed at a later time . 
At this point , his aspirin has been discontinued for a number of days and the Lopid was also discontinued apparently because of increased liver function tests . 
His current medications therefore include Lasix 4 0 mg per day , Metoprolol 2 5 mg qd , Nifedipine XL 3 0 mg qd . 
He is aware of a belching and burping sensation after eating but otherwise no exertional or other related symptoms . 
He is reasonably active but somewhat limited by his claudication . 
On exam today , he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 1 3 0 / 7 0 , a heart rate of 6 5 and regular . 
Head and neck were unremarkable . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distension at 3 0 degrees . 
PMI is normal . 
S 1 and S 2 are normal with a physiologic split . 
There is an S 4 and a I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border . 
Abdominal exam was unremarkable . 
Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis . 
His resting 1 2 - lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and a nonspecific left intraventricular conduction delay . 
Jacob Bautista , M . D . 
It would be of value to repeat an exercise test since he has not had one since 2 0 6 9 . 
He had minimal ischemia at that time . 
There are no symptoms that would prompt cardiac catheterization at this point and we will see how he does on the exercise test with the objective findings . 
If any problems develop , please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 
Thank you very much for allowing me to help with his care . 
Kindest personal regards . 
He feels his legs are better and that he can walk greater distances . 
He feels very comfortable . 
His current medications include Metoprolol 5 0 mg per day , Nifedipine XL 6 0 mg per day , Lasix 2 0 mg per day . 
On exam today , he has a blood pressure of 1 4 6 / 7 6 , a heart rate of 6 5 and regular . 
Weight 2 1 0 pounds . 
Head and neck unremarkable . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam is notable for an S 4 and a I / VI systolic ejection murmur . 
The rest of his exam was unremarkable . 
Resting 1 2 lead electrocardiogram is unchanged demonstrating normal sinus rhythm and a left axis deviation . 
There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay . 
I think Mr . Umstead is doing very well . 
He would like to have his arterial pulses rechecked noninvasively and I tried to arrange that schedule . 
In addition , his Metoprolol has been only once a day and if he can tolerate it twice a day he will have a better control and more prolonged risk prevention . 
I suggest that we increase it to 5 0 mg bid . 
I also told him how to take his pulse and he can keep an eye on it . 
If it drops too low we can reduce the dose . 
He asked that I see him again in about six months for routine re - evaluation and I will be happy to do so . 
If any problems develop in the interim please do not hesitate to contact me . 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care . 
Kindest regards . 
His primary limitation had been his claudication , but he feels that he can walk better now than in the past . 
We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure and volumes , and these actually were unchanged from a prior study two years ago . 
The post volume recordings were normal in each leg . 
Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg consistent with mild anterior tibial / dorsalis pedis disease . 
No systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg . 
These were unchanged from January , 2 0 7 2 . 
Mr . Umstead feels that he can be more physically active and is less limited . 
His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 5 0 mg b . i . d . , Nifedipine XL 6 0 mg q . d . , and Lasix 2 0 mg q . d . 
Of note , in October , 2 0 7 3 , he was found by colonoscopy to have four polyps which were removed . 
Apparently , no malignant cells were seen in the pathologic specimens . 
On exam , he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 1 2 2 / 6 8 , heart rate 6 3 and regular , weight 2 0 5 lbs . 
HEENT unremarkable . 
Chest was clear . 
Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 3 0 degrees , PMI is normal . 
S 1 and S 2 normal but physiologically split . 
There was an S 4 and a I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the lower left sternal border . 
Abdominal exam was unremarkable . 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis . 
His resting 1 2 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm , left axis deviation , and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent with his left anterior hemiblock . 
I think Mr . Umstead is doing quite well . 
He asked that I see him again in six months for routine re - evaluation , and I would be happy to do so . 
If any problems develop in the interim please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care . 
Per his wife who acts as his primary caretaker , Mr Umstead was in his USOH until about two weeks ago , when she began noticing increased lethargy and confusion . 
He developed gait instability and began confusing family members with each other , and being confused about whether the house he was in was his own . 
This increased in severity over the past 3 - 4 days . 
He complains of some weakness in his left leg but otherwise has had no other focal motor or sensory deficits . 
He has had no recent fevers , chills , SOB , sudden motor or sensory loss . 
No new incontinence . 
CXR and U / A performed showing no infectious processes . 
Head CT was performed showing no change from prior , though there was a small increase in the size of the lateral ventricles possibly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus . 
LP was negative . 
Pt was admitted to Internal Medicine for further workup of recent change in mental status and neuro / psych consult . 
MEDICAL HISTORY Cerebellar stroke : 1 / 8 2 .

There is a nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay with a borderline superior axis . 
There are nonspecific ST and T - wave changes .

Chronic right basal ganglia and bilateral cerebellar infarctions , stable from prior . 
Interval enlargement of ventricles and sulci consistent with progression of cortical volume loss . 
Mildly increased prominence of the lateral ventricles with increased periventricular hypoattenuation . 
Although this likely represents microangiopathic changes with commensurate ventricular prominence , consider normal pressure hydrocephalus in the correct clinical setting . 
Left axis deviation and LVH by R in aVL > 1 1 . 
The etiology of this downturn remains unclear . 
Given his normal temperature , normal CXR and normal U / A , an infectious etiology is unlikely . 
Concern for a stroke - related etiology , either embolic or lacunar , is unlikely given CT and MRI results . 
However , microembolic disease may be a possibility . 
As suggested in the CT results , normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility , though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely . 
LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH . 
One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process , perhaps due to hypertension . 
A more psychiatric etiology should also be considered in this patient . 
Depression can often manifest itself with lethargy and disorientation , especially in the elderly . 
However , it is difficult to adequately assess this in the absence of a caretaker , as Mr Umstead is currently difficult to direct with questioning . 
CT / MRI negative for acute embolic events .

Recommend follow - up to resolution . 
Pneumonia : Patient presented with fever to 1 0 1 and leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation and a new supplemental O 2 requirement . 
Was found to be hypotensive in the ED , although volume responsive and was normotensive on arrival to the MICU . 
Although a nursing home resident , he was initially covered in the ED with vanco , ceftriaxone , and azithromycin , and he defervesced overnight and so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the regular floors . 
Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to antibiotics were negative . 
On the floor , pt had fever to 1 0 0 . 8 and was broadened to vancomcyin , zosyn and azithromycin . 
He lost IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with linezolid , flagyl , and levofloxacin . 
He did well for > 3 6 hours with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be completed at home .

History was obtained by patient ' s nurse [ * * First Name ( Titles ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Titles ) 1 6 8 0 * * ] - HRI . 
At some point in [ * * Name ( NI ) 2 0 5 * * ] , pt ' s clozapine was discontinued due to agranulocytosis . 
This resulted in an acute psychotic episode , requiring hospitalization at [ * * Hospital 1 1 6 8 0 * * ] - HRI on [ * * 6 - 2 2 * * ] . 
She has been hospitalized at this facility for the past 5 weeks . 
Her nurse notes that over the first 2 - 3 weeks of her hospitalization , she steadily became more psychotic and paranoid , believing that she was being poisoned . 
For the past 3 weeks , pt . 
Per her nurse , she did not have any nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , SOB , cough , chest pain , fevers , or dysuria . 
Of note , a full set of basic labs were obtained on [ * * 7 - 1 8 * * ] . 
These were all wnl , including a BUN / Cr of 2 4 / 0 . 8 . 
She was started on lithium 3 0 0 mg TID on [ * * 7 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Over the past week , staff have noted that she has been increasingly tremulous and unsteady on her feet , requiring a walker to ambulate . 
Over the past two days , pt . 
She was refusing to get out of bed and being more agitated . 
A lithium level was checked and was 3 . 5 . 
This prompted transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED . 
In the ED , initial VS were : 1 0 0 . 2 1 2 0 1 1 5 / 9 2 1 8 9 7 % Labs were notable for Lithium level of 3 . 0 .

LUE US [ * * 2 1 3 8 - 8 - 2 * * ] : FINDINGS : Grayscale and color Doppler son [ * * Name ( NI ) 4 9 3 * * ] evaluation was performed of the left upper extremity . 
Normal compressibility and flow was seen in the left subclavian , internal jugular , brachial , basilic and cephalic veins without evidence of left upper extremity DVT . 
Acute Issues : # Lithium Toxicity : The patient was found to ahve a Lithium level of 3 . 0 on arrival . 
It is unlikely that this represents an overdose as patient has been an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital . 
She has only been on lithium for approximately 1 week . 
It is likely that patient sustained an acute kidney injury over the course of the past few weeks , causing decreased renal lithium clearance , resulting in toxicicty . 
Toxicology and renal were consulted . 
Temporary femoral HD line was placed , and she was dialyzed x 1 session . 
Lithium level was checked 6 hours after dialysis and was 1 . 0 , re - check was 1 . 2 , then came down to 0 . 9 as UOP picked up . 
Her lithium level decreased again to 0 . 7 and then to < 0 . 2 . 
This was likely pre - renal [ * * 1 2 - 2 6 * * ] poor po intake over past few weeks . 
She received 2 L boluses of NS and had maintenance fluids of NS at 2 0 0 - 2 5 0 cc . 
Her UOP increased significantly with aggressive hydration and her creatinine returned to her baseline of 0 . 8 . 
The patient was initially started on Vancomycin and it was thought that the gram positive cocci represented a contamination . 
Upon speciation of strep viridans , Infectious Disease was consulted . 
They considered this a low risk bacteremia and recommended 1 4 days of ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily from negative cultures . 
Repeat cultures on [ * * 2 1 3 8 - 7 - 3 0 * * ] were with no growth . 
The temporary hemodialysis catheter tip was sent for culture on [ * * 7 - 3 1 * * ] and was with no growth . 
A midline was placed on [ * * 2 1 3 8 - 8 - 2 * * ] for antibiotic administration and antibiotics will be completed on [ * * 2 1 3 8 - 8 - 1 4 * * ] . 
Agitation was generally well controlled with PRN Ativan . 
Continued to be agitated and responding to internal stimuli . 
Her antipsychotics were initially held in setting of acute lithium toxicity due to increased risk of NMS . 
Psych was consulted and followed patient . 
They recommended re - starting her aripiprazole and it was slowly titrated back to home dose of 3 0 mg daily . 
She was discharged to inpatient psych bed on [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] 4 . 
Chronic : # Schizophrenia / Bioplar : Psych was consulted and followed patient . 
Initially all psych meds were held in the setting of acute lithium toxicity . 
Her aripriprazole was started back and slowly titrated back to home dose . 
The remainder of psych meds were held . 
She was discharged to inpatient psych bed on [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] 4 . 
Her home synthroid was continued during hospitalization and cytomel will be restarted upon discharge .

As you know , Dr . Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 1 7 th , at which point , he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA , first obtuse marginal , and second obtuse marginal . 
He tolerated the procedure uneventfully . 
His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy . 
He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed , which has stayed in since discharge . 
He spent approximately 1 0 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home . 
Currently , he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm ; however , he denies symptoms of active angina , congestive failure , or sensed arrhythmias .

There is evidence of left bundle - branch block with secondary ST and T - wave changes . 
An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 4 0 % at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate . 
No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm . 
I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm . 
I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3 - 6 months , and assuming , he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period , his amiodarone would then be discontinued . 
At that time , I would also discontinue his Coumadin . 
In addition , at the time of his diagnostic catheterization , he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease , and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery , I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention . 
In addition , I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center . 
I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction . 
He will have routine blood studies obtained today . 
I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 7 0 range . 
Beyond this , I have not altered his current regimen . 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in his care .

He states that he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeks ago , after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water at night . 
Later that night , after going to bed and falling asleep , he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as a curtain descending down over his abdomen . 
He states it felt as if his body , in the region of his abdomen , had just shut down . 
He fell back asleep the night , hoping that the strange feeling would go away on its own . 
Over the next few days , he began to notice a pain in his upper back . 
He describes that pain as similar to a muscle spasm , in his back , that does not radiate . 
When the pain first began , it was intermittent and could be brought on by nearly anything , including getting up to walk and eating . 
He tried Advil and acetominophen which helped at first to relieve his pain . 
He noticed that his pain gradually became more intense , and more intolerable . 
He reports occasional chest pain , shortness of breath , and feeling feverish when his pain would become severe . 
At the time of presentation to an OSH , his pain was constant , not relieved with Advil or acetominophen , and he reports it as a [ * * 9 - 2 6 * * ] . 
He also developed a dry , non - productive cough over the past 2 - 3 days , and a feeling of nausea that developed when he would cough .

There is degenerative disc disease at multiple levels . 
At C 4 - C 5 , there is a small central disc protrusion without evidence of canal or foraminal stenosis . 
At C 5 - C 6 , there is a broad - based disc - osteophyte bar producing moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis . 
At C 6 - C 7 , there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis . 
There is no evidence of abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement . 
There is involvement of the disc , and there is an epidural mass . 
The features in general suggest that this may be a malignant process rather than an active infection , although granulomatous disease would be an additional consideration . 
The findings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess , but this is not entirely excluded . 
Mild disc bulging . 
No evidence of focal disc protrusion . 
No evidence of a destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region . 
CT T - spine w / o contrast [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 1 1 - 3 0 * * ] : Again seen is destruction of the inferior one - half of T 7 and superior endplate of T 8 with a large associated paraspinal mass . 
There is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion of bone fragments into the ventral part of the spinal canal . 
The degree of cord compression is better evaluated on the previous day ' s MRI . 
Again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at this locale . 
No new abnormalities are identified . 
There are emphysematous changes in the lungs . 
Aortic calcifications are identified .

Small bilateral pleural effusions but no evidence for CHF . 
Small well defined nodular density right lung base . 
Correlate with prior outside films if available . 
Further evaluation , either by follow up plain radiographs in approx 3 months or by CT is suggested . 
Chest CT [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 1 2 - 7 * * ] : The multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are subcentimeter ranging up to 9 mm in the right paratracheal , 8 mm in the outer pulmonary , and 1 cm in subcarinal are . 
There is no hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy . 
The aorta is calcified with relatively thick mural plaques ranging up to 4 mm , some of them ulcerated , for example in the proximal distending thoracic aorta , series 2 , image 2 6 , 2 7 ; at the level of the aortic arch , series 2 , image 2 1 ; in the distending aorta , series 2 , image 3 1 . 
The extensive mural thickening also involve the origin of the left subclavian and left carotid and innominate arteries . 
The assessment of the lung parenchyma demonstrate mild centrilobular emphysema involving predominantly the upper lobes . 
A focal thickening of the left fissure is 4 . 3 mm in length . 
The bilateral pleural effusion is small with adjacent lung atelectasis . 
Additional area of focal pleural thickening is in the right upper lobe , series 4 , image 4 5 . 
No other lung nodules or masses are identified . 
The images of the upper abdomen demonstrate normal liver , spleen , adrenals , pancreas and kidneys . 
The gallbladder is markedly distended measuring up to 6 cm in diameter with some high - attenuation of the posterior portion suggesting vicarious excretion . 
Decrease in size of a moderate left pleural effusion with loculated components . 
High attenuation within a loculated fluid collection in the left upper hemithorax suggests component of possible hemothorax and is unchanged . 
No evidence of new or active extravasation . 
Ground - glass opacity at the left base consistent with reexpansion edema in the setting of recent thoracentesis . 
Bibasilar hydrostatic interstitial edema . 
Stable appearance of postoperative change within the mid thoracic spine as above .

PPD : Negative C diff x 3 negative C diff B toxin - pending BCXs : all no growth to date UCXs : no growth . 
He subsequently was found to have a MSSA osteomyelolitis , underwent colpectomy and fusion , however his course was complicated by post - op NSTEMI , bradycardic arrest ( complete heart block ) , upper extremity venous clot , and delerium . 
Patient had decreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurological deficits , and back was non - tender to palpation . 
No leg weakness , sensory deficits or bowel / bladder incontinence . 
MRI on admission showed an epidural mass at T 7 - T 8 level with some moderate cord compression . 
CT spine confirmed this finding . 
Found to have elevated ESR to 1 0 2 and CRP of 2 1 6 concerning for infectious process . 
Based on imaging the differential of the epidural mass was infection ( bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma ) , vs malignancy vs AV malformation . 
The patient denied any history or exposure to TB , however he was in North [ * * Country 4 8 0 * * ] in the [ * * 2 0 4 4 * * ] ' s during the Korean war . 
Recalled one episode of walking pneumonia , nearly 2 0 years ago , was not hospitalized . 
Recalls no episodes of hemoptysis . 
The patient denied any history of malignancy , however he has not seen a physician in many years . 
Given the possibility of infection he was started on broad - spectrum abx including Ceftriaxone , vancomycin and flagyl IV . 
He was afebrile . 
Ortho spine followed the patient and he was provided with a TLSO brace given his T 7 collapse . 
Serial neurological exams were performed looking for signs of cord compression and were normal . 
Gram stain and culture returned positive for GPC . 
ID was consulted for further recommendations . 
When organisms were identified as Staph aureus the ceftriaxone and flagyl were discontinued . 
He was continued on vancomycin with goal troughs 1 7 - 2 0 . 
When sensitivities returned MSSA the vancomycin was switched to Nafcillin 2 gm IV q 4 h . 
ID recommended TTE given epidural abscess and murmur on exam ( unclear age given no regular medical care ) . 
TTE showed no evidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses . 
A TEE was not performed given the patient would require a long course of antibiotics and TEE would not change the management . 
A PPD was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differential and was negative . 
Additionally , AFB smear and stain were both negative . 
AFB culture is pending . 
There was no evidence of granulomas on CXR or chest CT suggestive of old TB infection . 
Although the patient appeared to have an MSSA abscess , an underlying process could not be excluded . 
Given possibility for underlying malignancy an SPEP / UPEP were sent . 
PSA was 1 . 0 and chest CT showed no lung nodules . 
Path of epidural biopsy showed inflammation . 
Given the location of the abscess and involvement of T 7 - T 8 vertebrae with T 7 collapse , the patient was taken to the OR for surgical spine debridement / stabilization by ortho spine . 
He underwent two surgical procedures to debride and stabilize his spine ( please see op notes from [ * * 1 2 - 1 0 * * ] and [ * * 1 2 - 1 3 * * ] for details ) . 
He should complete a 6 week course of nafcillin to end on [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 1 - 2 0 * * ] . 
He has follow up with [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic on [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 1 - 5 * * ] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy . 
An EKG revealed lateral ST depressions . 
The pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mild hypotension . 
His cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponin T peak of 0 . 2 7 . 
His CPK - MB was also mildly elevated to 1 2 . 
He was conservatively managed particularly with regard to his recent spine surgery . 
His cardiac regimen was adjusted to include aspirin , beta - blocker , ACE inhibitor , and Imdur . 
This episode was not captured on telemetry . 
He received CPR as his DNR status had temporarily been changed peri - operative . 
He was resuscitated successfully without use of epinephrine , atropine , or electricity . 
He was initially stabilized after transfer to the CCU but had a similar arrest twice the next morning each following repositioning . 
Telemetry revealed complete heartblock . 
An externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw - in lead in the RV as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitis was being treated . 
The bradycardia appears to have been triggered by excessive vagal tone . 
The day before discharge a perm . 
He has follow up on [ * * 2 1 0 1 - 1 - 5 * * ] with the device clinic to further evaluate the pacer . 
No baseline for comparison . 
Fe studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease . 
Patient reports no hemoptysis , hematemesis , melena , or hematochezia . 
EBL from the surgery was ~ 5 0 0 cc . 
Late into his CCU stay , he developed guaiac positive stool . 
His Hct stabilized after transfusion . 
He continued on a PPI . 
He can follow - up with his PCP for potential referral to GI for colonoscopy as an outpatient . 
He was found not to have capacity to refuse life saving interventions . 
His daughter [ * * Name ( NI ) 2 1 2 7 * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) 7 0 0 7 3 * * ] was appointed health care proxy . 
The patient ' s agitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldol as well . 
Other sedating medications such as narcotics and benzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible . 
Once he was transferred to the regular medical floor his delirium improved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs of delirium . 
He was started on an aggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement of large amount of narcotics . 
This bowel regimen was weaned down over the course of his hospital stay . 
Since being on the antibiotics , he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube in place . 
The diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs . the antibiotics themselves . 
He was tested for C diff and found to be negative x 3 . 
A C diff B toxin has been sent and will be followed up after discharge . 
BP was initially labile and elevated readings seemed to correlate with pain . 
When pain was better controlled the patient ' s BP remained elevated with SBP 1 4 0 - 1 5 0 at times . 
His blood pressure was controlled as above . 
No evidence of peripheral vascular compromise . 
Vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months with ultrasound . 
He was initially anticoagulated but this was held in the setting of the GIB . 
Warm compresses and arm elevation should be used to limit propagation of the clot . 
The patient had a CTA of the chest that was negative for PE . 
He did not have any clinical evidence of pneumonia ( no fever , normalizing WBC , no definitive consolidation on imaging ) . 
Antibiotics , levofloxicin , directed at this bacteria were started when he was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR and some shortness of breath . 
He also developed a large pleural effusion and underwent a thorocentesis . 
The fluid was exudative and likely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain was negative ( he has been on antibiotics ) . 
The cytology is still pending and should be followed up by his PCP . 
Did have hypokalemia likely secondary to medications and loose stools . 
He will receive standing potassium repletion and need potassium level checked shortly after discharge to adjust the dose .

History of Present Illness : 7 3 year old man with history of COPD , hyperlipidemia , HTN who presents to the ED intubated by paramedics after they were called to his home for increasing SOB . 
The details of the events leading up to his intubation are not clear . 
In discussion with friend [ * * Name ( NI ) 7 3 2 9 8 * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] , she reports that [ * * Name ( NI ) 2 6 9 * * ] came to visit on [ * * 1 2 - 1 9 * * ] at which time he was reportedly " doing well " in terms of his respiratory status . 
Sometime after [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 2 6 9 * * ] left , however , pt . 
It was at that time that EMS was called . 
There is no EMS record in paperwork from the ED , but per verbal report from ED resident , pt was so SOB that he requested intubation when EMS arrived to his home . 
Although per verbal s / o there was report that he never picked up steroids that were prescribed on discharge , I am unable to find a record of steroids having been prescribed during his last admission and further upon discharge . 
He was intubated at home and was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED for further evaluation . 
Of note , he was admitted to the surgical service from [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 2 1 5 0 4 * * ] / 0 8 after presenting with abdominal pain / rectal bleeding and progressive SOB . 
He was intubated in emergency room d / t increasing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs . 
He had subsequent additional hct drop and EGD was repeated on [ * * 1 2 - 1 3 * * ] showing e / o recently bleeding pyloric ulcer . 
Ulcer was injected with epi and endoclip was deployed unsuccessfully . 
He received a total of 8 units prbcs , 1 bag platelets , 1 unit FFP last on [ * * 1 2 - 3 * * ] after which his hct remained stable without any further bleeding . 
He was continued on [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] PPI and was treated for h . pylori . 
Although his respiratory failure was attributed to COPD exacerbation , it does not appear that he received steroids during his hospital stay . 
He was , however , extubated successfully and when ambulating with PT during last admission , he became SOB with O 2 sats dipping into the 8 0 % and CTA was positive for subsegmental PE and he was started on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin prior to discharge . 
In the ED , initial vs were : T 1 0 0 . 0 P 1 2 0 BP 9 5 / 7 7 Intubated and breathing at set rate of 1 6 O 2 sat 1 0 0 % on AC ( exact settings unclear ) . 
CTA chest on prelim read showed no PE , pneumonia or edema ; it showed unchanged pulmonary nodules . 
UA showed few bacteria , no squams , 6 WBCs , [ * * 2 - 2 7 * * ] RBCs . 
He received 1 2 5 mg IV solumedrol , 1 g IV ceftriaxone and 5 0 0 mg IV azithromycin x 1 . 
He received versed for sedation . 
He received a total of 6 L NS .

Brief Hospital Course : 7 3 year old man with COPD ( FEV 1 0 . 9 6 ) , HTN , hyperlipidemia and recent GIB from PUD presents 2 days post discharge , intubated at home by paramedics after c / o increasing dyspnea . 
It appears that he had been doing okay at home since his d / c on [ * * 1 2 - 1 7 * * ] , but complained to his friend over the phone that he needed help d / t increasing SOB ( which prompted EMS call ) . 
Per verbal s / o from ED , he had been prescribed prednisone upon discharge on [ * * 1 2 - 1 7 * * ] for COPD exacerbation , but pt did not pick up prescription . 
He was intubated on presentation to the ED on last presentation as well presumably thought d / t COPD exacerbation . 
Was diagnosed with PE on last admission by CTA on [ * * 1 2 - 1 0 * * ] ( " Isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of uncertain clinical significance " ) . 
He was on heparin and discharged on coumadin for this finding and repeat CTA on this presentation does not even comment on subsegmental PE on prelim read so seems very unlikely to be causing clinical presentation . 
No e / o volume overload nor of pneumonia on CT chest and unable to obtain hx re : cough / sputum production . 
The patient was given IV steroids which was subsequently trasitioned to oral prednisone with [ * * Doctor Last Name 2 9 4 9 * * ] . 
He was continued on standing MDIs and was given azithromycin . 
Sputum and blood cultures were no growth to date . 
Presented with SBPs in the 9 0 s where he has largely remained stable despite 6 L IVFs . 
Unclear etiology . 
Infection suspected initially but his UA was unremarkable and his CT of chest without e / o infiltrate . 
No other signs of infection were evident . 
His SBPs improved during the hospitalization and remained stable without IVF . 
INR has been therapeutic and repeat CTA today with prelim report showing no PE . 
Goal INR per d / c summary was 2 - 2 . 5 given recent GIB ; INR currently 2 . 7 . 
Anticoagulation was continued during this admission . 
Trop could be up in setting of PE , but PE on last admission seems so small ( subsegmental ) that it is unlikely to be the underlying cause of his hypoxia and positive trop . 
EKG did show probable a . flutter with rate in the 1 2 0 s so demand ischemia possible . 
Continued statin and ASA ; holding BB given relative hypotension . 
Cardiology saw the patient and recomended outpatient follow up . 
It appears that he was initiated on amoxacillin and clarithromycin on [ * * 1 2 - 4 * * ] and thus , should have completed a full 2 week course at this time . 
Does not appear to have diagnsosis of this prior to that . 
CHADS 2 score of [ * * 1 2 - 2 7 * * ] with HTN and age nearly > 7 5 . 
He is currently anticoagulated and INR is therapeutic . 
Medications on Admission : Will need verification as d / c summary completed 1 0 days prior to actual discharge so not clear exactly on what he was discharged .

No contrast was administered due to the patient ' s inability to further cooperate and the marginal renal status . 
There is no evidence of infarction . 
The MRA demonstrates a dominant and patent right vertebral artery with a tiny , but apparently patent left vertebral artery , and patent internal carotid arteries bilaterally . 
The remainder of the study , although limited , demonstrates no evidence of hemorrhage or other abnormalities . 
No evidence of hemoperitoneum or retroperitoneal hemorrhage . 
Cirrhotic liver , with signs for portal hypertension with a large amount of ascites . 
Consolidation within the lower lobes of the lungs bilaterally , most likely represents atelectasis . 
However , superimposed infection cannot be excluded . 
Cholelithiasis . 
Anasarca . 
Patent TIPS with abnormally high velocities within the mid and distal aspects of the shunt , similar to the previous exam . 
Findings remain compatible with TIPS malfunction . 
Limited evaluation of the left and anterior right portal vein although suggestion of abnormal directionality of flow within the left portal vein is compatible with shunt dysfunction . 
Cirrhotic liver with moderate - to - severe perihepatic ascites and cholelithiasis . 
Left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size and regional / global systolic function are normal ( LVEF 7 0 % ) . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present . 
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve . 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
There is no mitral valve prolapse . 
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve . 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen . 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal . 
No vegetation / mass is seen on the pulmonic valve . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
Compared with the findings of the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 1 0 - 2 7 * * ] , no major change is evident . 
She was reported to have a hx of poor compliance with lactulose at home . 
Of note , she has not had other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this . 
Head CT at OSH was negative . 
Given her leukocytosis on admission , infection , particularly SBP or pneumonia , were also considered . 
Overdose was also a possibility , although family denies drug use . 
Upon arrival in the MICU she was started on lactulose and rifaximine . 
She underwent a paracentesis to eval for SBP , which had a negative gram stain and culture . 
Given her AMS , she was considered high risk for aspiration , and she was started on empiric treatment with vanc / aztreonam / azithromycin ( allergic to cipro and keflex ) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA vs SBP . 
While there was no known hx of EtOH abuse , thiamine IV was administered . 
On exam the pt had some focal findings of persistent right - [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] and downward deviation of her eyes , with inability to track past midline . 
She had a repeat head CT and an MRI / MRA which were both without evidence of significant pathology . 
Following extubation and decreased sedation , her mental status improved and the focal eye findings resolved . 
While not back at her baseline , pt was awake , alert , and oriented x 3 when she was transferred to the floor . 
Pt seen by Neurology , but had already had significant improvement and no focal findings . 
On the floor , her mental status continued to improve . 
At time of discharge , she is back to baseline , conversational , oriented x 3 but at times is tearful . 
She is being discharged on Rifaximin and furosemide . 
Her CXR here suggested a possible aspiration pneumonia , which could have been [ * * 3 - 1 2 * * ] to her AMS . 
It is unclear if she received IVF at OSH . 
She was weaned off of the vent quickly as she required minimal pressure support and had good RSBIs . 
She was extubated on [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 1 1 - 1 7 * * ] was satting well on room air at the time of transfer to the floor . 
On discharge , she continues to have oxygen saturations in the high 9 0 ' s on room air . 
Dermatology was consulted . 
The blisters and bullae were thought to be [ * * 3 - 1 2 * * ] trauma in the setting of coagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin . 
Urine Porphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in the setting of Hep C liver disease and were negative . 
The diffuse maculopapular rash appeared to be new , and looks more like a hypersensitivity reaction , likely to ertapenem . 
Pt has known allergies to Keflex ad Cipro , and had received ertapenem at the OSH . 
She was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rash on abdomen and lower extremities ( avoiding folds ) , and hydrocortisone 2 . 5 % cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin . 
Also , the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt ' s legs , arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound care as recommended by our wound care team and plastics . 
She had a RUQ ultrasound on [ * * 1 1 - 1 6 * * ] and again on [ * * 1 1 - 2 3 * * ] which showed her TIPS was patent . 
She should have a repeats TIPS ultrasound in 1 month . 
She had a 5 L paracentesis on [ * * 1 1 - 2 0 * * ] which was negative for increased WBC and culture was sterile . 
Daptomycin was started on [ * * 1 1 - 1 7 * * ] . 
ID was consulted in house . 
TTE showed no vegetations on [ * * 1 1 - 2 4 * * ] . 
The pt should be continued on IV daptomycin to complete a 1 4 day course on [ * * 2 1 8 5 - 1 2 - 2 * * ] . 
Also may be exacerbated by acute illness . 
She received albumin 2 5 g in 5 0 0 cc NS x 2 and her HR and urine output were followed . 
Her diuretics were held until the next morning . 
At discharge , her HR remains in the 8 0 ' s to 9 0 ' s . 
Her diuretics were gradually restarted on the floor . 
She is not accumulating ascited at the time of discharge . 
As diuretics were increased , her sodium gradually decreased to 1 2 9 on day of discharge . 
Treatment ongoing for this condition should include ongoing fluid restriction to approximately 1 5 0 0 cc / day . 
These were stopped and Ca is now 9 . 9 at time of discharge . 
Recommend not restarting these medications at this time . 
Plt at discharge are 1 6 4 .

Brief Hospital Course : As noted in the HPI , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was noted in the trauma bay to have bilateral mangled extremities . 
He also had an absent radial pulse on the left side prompting vascular surgery involvement . 
He was noted to have extensively mangled bilateral upper extremities as well as a left buttock soft tissue injury that did not appear to track to bone . 
Orthopedics , plastics and vascular surgery were consulted in addition to the acute care surgery team and he was taken to the OR directly from the trauma bay . 
Please refer to the individual operative summaries from the various teams providing care from [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 6 - 2 4 * * ] for specific details but , in brief , vascular surgery performed a thrombectomy of the left brachial artery with primary repair of arteriotomy after initial debridement and washout by ACS and orthopedics . 
The wounds were wrapped and a vac was applied to the buttock wound . 
He was taken to the Trauma ICU postoperatively . 
Patient underwent one more debridement surgery on [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 6 - 2 8 * * ] and then and initial reconstructive surgery of bilateral upper extremities with skin grafts and integra on [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 7 - 5 * * ] . 
Patient ' s mental status improved after ICU stay and he was alert and able to carry on conversations with staff . 
At times he was A + Ox 3 but at other times confused . 
He is able to recall the dog attack . 
Geriatric team felt fluctuations in mental status were multifactorial and related to trauma , de - conditioning , ICU stay , sleep deprivation , pain medications . 
They felt that this would gradually improve over time and with supportive care . 
Neuro : He was intubated and sedated in the immediate post - operative period and for several days while in the TICU . 
He was on fentanyl and propofol for pain control and sedation during this time . 
When he was awake and extubated , his pain was controlled with IV dilaudid for dressing changes and oxycodone for complaints of pain in between . 
Cardiovascular : He did not require vasopressors in the post - operative period . 
He was hemodynamically stable . 
He did have a history of paroxysmal afib but was in normal sinus rhythym for most of his admission . 
His coumadin was held during this admission and he was prophylactically anticoagulated with once daily lovenox injections . 
Heme : Patient required multiple blood product transfusions during his ICU stay due to loss of blood at the scene of the attack and subsequently due to oozing open wounds . 
Geriatrics was consulted for help with managing patient once he was transferred to the floor and onto Plastics surgery service . 
Geriatrics recommended starting patient on thiamine , folate and MVI for h / o heavy EtOH and persistent anemia post - traumatic event and subsequent surgeries . 
Resp : Initially , he was intubated with an ETT on MMV and CMV , eventually weaned to CPAP and then successfully extubated on [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 6 - 3 0 * * ] . 
Patient continued to improve his respiratory status post extubation . 
On hospital day # 1 9 , there was a question as to whether patient may have aspirated after a meal when his head of bed was lowered . 
Patient was encouraged to cough and deep breathe and his vital signs / O 2 sats remained stable . 
He was ordered for albuterol nebulizer treatments PRN for wheezes . 
GI / nutrition : In the post - operative period , he had an OGT placed and was started on tube feeds under the guidance of Nutrition . 
Patient received isosource 1 . 5 with a goal rate of 6 0 cc / hr . 
He tolerated these well . 
When patient was awake and alert , Speech and Swallowing was consulted to assess the patient ' s safety eating different consistencies of foods and liquids . 
A video swallow revealed evidence of some aspiration of thin liquids so patient was placed on soft / ground diet which he tolerated well . 
Patient self d / c ' d his Dobhoff tube and it was not replaced due to ability to take POs . 
Patient required 1 : 1 assistance with all of his meals and snacks .

His creatinine was elevated on admission and trended down to 1 . 4 at discharge . 
His electrolytes were repleted PRN . 
He was given lasix / albumin to assist with his edema on HD 5 . 
Patient ' s foley was maintained for inpatient stay due to inability to utilize a urinal manually d / t bilateral upper extremity injuries and dressings . 
ID : He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics , vanc / zosyn / clinda . 
Infectious Disease was consulted on [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 6 - 2 5 * * ] to help with antibiotic guidance and postexposure rabies vaccinations . 
Patient received Rabies Immune Globulin 1 6 5 0 UNIT IM ONCE within 2 4 - hours of arrival and then Rabies vaccine on days 1 , 3 , 7 and 1 4 . 
The clindamycin was dc ' d on [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 6 - 2 8 * * ] due to lessened concern for a necrotizing soft tissue infection . 
Blood cultures were negative . 
A tissue sample obtained in the OR from left elbow grew VRE so Vancomycin was discontinued and patient was maintained on zosyn IV until [ * * 2 1 9 1 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Patient remained negative C . difficele despite multiple loose stools / day . 
Prophylaxis : Patient was maintained on Lovenox 4 0 mg QD for DVT prophylaxis and wore pneumo boots while in bed . 
He was assisted in and out of bed to chair when he was able to tolerate transfers . 
Patient was assisted to use his incentive spirometer . 
TLD : He had a right groin CVL placed during the initial trauma evaluation .

He is CP free and stable and is being transferred for further evaluation and work up . 
Last HD session on Tuesday . 
Last dobutamine echo last year showed some LV apex hypokinesis , which augments in response dobutamine . 
ECG revealed NSR at 8 2 w / poor R wave progression on anterior leads . 
Qwave on AvL but no new TWI or ST changes . 
Echo at OSH reveiled lower EF at 3 0 - 3 5 % with HK on anteroseptal , mid anterior , apical lateral and apical inferior walls segments . 
He reports chronic dypsnea on moderate exertion . 
He is quite sedentary . 
ROS : preserved appetite .

His current medications include aspirin 8 1 mg p . o . 
BID nonHD days , lexapro 1 0 mg p . o . 
The trend of his creatinine from outside hospital is not suggestive of acute coronary syndrome . 
Troponin leak is a common finding in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis since the hemodynamic changes lead to subendocardial ischemia during short - time ultrafiltration . 
On the other hand , due to the difficulty in evaluating ACS in patients that had undergone transplant , will repeat cardiac markers for the next 1 2 hours and meanwhile , continue medical management with ASA , statin , BB and heparin . 
The lower EF on outside echo could suggest as well recent past event of myocardial infarction , especially with the multiple walls demonstrating hypokinesis .

He was initially alert and oriented with no clear injuries , but in route became unresponsive with reported respiratory arrest and was intubated in the helicopter . 
He reportedly was a difficult intubation there is significant amount of emesis and blood in the airway , although he was intubated on the first pass . 
No acute intracranial process . 
Small frontal subgaleal soft tissue hematoma . 
Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and nasal cavity with intermediate [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] measurements , likely due to chronic sinusitis and secretions rather than hemorrhage . 
Bony defect at the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus is likely postsurgical after nasal antral window . 
Linear lucency at the anterior nasal spine of the maxilla is likely a vascular channel rather than a fracture given lack of soft tissue swelling . 
No fracture or acute subluxation . 
Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and the nasal cavity , likely due to a combination of chronic sinus disease and secretions after intubation . 
Large bilateral posterior lung opacities and diffuse ground - glass opacities in both lungs , likely due to aspiration given the clinical history ( of an aspiraton event ) and the secretions layering in the distal trachea . 
No other acute injury of the chest , abdomen and pelvis . 
The lungs are otherwise clear , representing improvement from prior exams . 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal . 
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax . 
Advanced conditions of the liver such as cirrhosis or fibrosis is not excluded . 
He was already intubated . 
His ICU course was dominated by respiratory failure and inability to wean from ventilator . 
It was felt he had an aspiration event , and that aspiration pneumonitis was the primary cause of the respiratory failure . 
Initially , he required muscular paralysis to maintain ventilator mechanics , this was weaned off within 4 8 hours . 
He continued to be hypoxic when attempting to wean him from CMV to CPAP , and CXR showed possible infiltrate , so he was bronched and started on empiric antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia . 
He continued to spike fevers daily until HD 4 . 
When his BAL results came back as streptococcus pneumoniae , his antibiotics were briefly narrowed to ceftriaxone monotherapy , then re - broadened to Vanc / Cipro / Flagyl per the recommendation of an Infectious Disease consult . 
To further assist in weaning him from the ventilator , a lasix drip was begun HD 3 and run for 2 days with good diuresis . 
By HD 4 , he was transitioned to CPAP and breathing well on his own mechanics . 
Also this day , he displayed groin and back erythema , thought to be a combination of fungal infection and drug reaction . 
On HD 5 he was weaned from propofol and versed to Precedex while simultaneously weaning his PEEP requirements . 
He was eventually extubated HD 6 and transferred to the floor . 
Also of note durinig his ICU course : He was evaluated on CIWA scales but did not score significantly . 
He had diarrhea while in the ICU , C . Dif was negative , resolved with fiber . 
He was maintained on prophylaxis while in the ICU : Heparin sub - cu , famotidine , VAP bundle . 
He had a left subclavian central line placed on [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 5 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Floor course : On [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 5 - 2 6 * * ] he was transferred to the floor . 
His fever curve was monitored and trended downward . 
His CVL was removed on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] and cultured with no growth . 
By [ * * 5 - 2 7 * * ] he remained afebrile . 
However , he was noted to have a rising WBC count to 1 2 and then 1 6 . 9 ( from 5 . 5 ) . 
His chest xray on [ * * 5 - 2 8 * * ] showed no evidence of pneumonia and he was without cough or sputum . 
He was weaned off the oxygen with good oxygen saturation on room air . 
All antibiotics were discontinued at this point . 
Blood test showed elevated lipase to > 8 0 0 . 
RUQ US showed hepatic steatosis . 
Gastroenterology was consulted and felt this was likely due to alcoholic pancreatitis . 
Patient will follow - up in their clinic for this . 
Otherwise he remained hemodynamically stable . 
Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated him . 
Occupational therapy recommended outpatient follow - up with cognitive neurology .

At that time , he had been on glyburide , metformin and Avandia , his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia . 
He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient . 
Over the next weeks to months , the patient had progressive peripheral edema , fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . 
He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 6 0 mg orally on this .

He has had inadequate glycemic control on oral agents which are currently at their maximal doses given the intolerable side effects of Avandia . 
He has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control , should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation , especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on Avandia . 
We will start insulin today initially NPH 2 5 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide . 
We have instructed him on use of the Inolet for insulin administration . 
He will continue his glyburide 1 0 mg each morning , continue metformin 1 0 0 0 mg twice daily and Avandia 2 mg each morning .

The patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up . 
I will be sending a copy of this letter to Dr . Oliver Oates as evaluation for preop assessment as well . 
Mr . Fair is a 6 1 - year - old male who has a number of risk factors for coronary artery disease but is unaware of any known prior manifestations . 
He has had diabetes mellitus for about 2 0 years . 
About two months ago , he started on insulin , and he is now followed by you at the Endocrine Group . 
His most recent glucose had been in the range of 8 6 with his lipids including total cholesterol of 1 5 7 , triglycerides 1 0 3 , HDL of 4 2 , and LDL of 9 4 . 
His current medical regimen for these and his other problems include insulin NPH 1 0 units in the morning , 2 5 units in the afternoon , glyburide 2 0 mg q . d . , and metformin 1 0 0 0 mg q . d . . 
He also takes Lasix 6 0 mg per day , lisinopril 4 0 mg per day , and Lipitor 1 0 mg q . d . 
His other risk factors are notable for hypertension , which has been labile and borderline high in the past . 
He is currently on the lisinopril with apparently good control of his pressure . 
He has had hypercholesterolemia and is now doing well on Lipitor . 
He does not smoke cigarettes , but he is obese . 
He has no known history of MI , angina , or shortness of breath . 
His other risk is notable for his family history , which includes his father who died at the age of 7 2 of an MI as well as leukemia . 
His mother died at the age of 7 4 of mesothelioma , and he has two sisters and one brother who are well . 
He had an echo performed on February 2 , 2 0 8 5 , in anticipation of his knee surgery in March 2 0 8 5 , and this was notable for a mildly dilated left ventricle with mild concentric LVH . 
Overall LV function is mildly - to - moderately reduced with an estimated ejection fraction of 4 0 % . 
The entire inferior and posterior walls were akinetic and thin consistent with myocardial scar . 
The apical anterior wall , apical lateral wall , and left ventricular apex were hypokinetic suggestive of myocardial hibernation or scar . 
The right ventricle was normal in size and function , the left atrium was mildly dilated , the aortic valve was unremarkable , the mitral valve was slightly thickened with mild - to - moderate mitral regurgitation , and the tricuspid valve was structurally normal . 
His past medical history is notable for kidney stones , which he has had over the past 1 0 years or so . 
He has had three or four attacks , the most recent one was two years ago . 
He also has the severe osteoarthritis of the lower extremities predominantly affecting the knees . 
Both Achilles tendons have been damaged as well apparently . 
He is anticipating knee replacement with Dr . Oates on March 2 3 , 2 0 8 5 . 
Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use . 
He has a convenience store and frequently eats out of it throughout the day with poor dietary habits . 
His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable . 
On exam , he is obese but comfortable . 
Blood pressure is 1 5 0 / 8 0 , heart rate of 6 7 and regular , and weight of 2 7 8 pounds . 
Head and neck are unremarkable . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 3 0 degrees . 
PMI is normal . 
S 1 and S 2 are normal with a physiologic split . 
There is an S 4 and 1 / 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border . 
Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly . 
The abdomen is obese . 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis . 
Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit . 
Distal pulses are normal . 
His resting 1 2 - lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm with evidence of previous inferior MI and poor R - wave progression , V 1 through V 3 . 
He has a superior axis likely related to the inferior MI . 
The QRS is increased with nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay . 
Mr . Fair clearly has evidence of coronary artery disease with at least one myocardial infarction . 
This had been entirely asymptomatic and was quite a shock for Mr . Fair to hear this information . 
We will obtain an adenosine MIBI scan prior to his surgery to be sure we have a better idea of the status of his myocardial perfusion . 
In addition , I strongly encouraged him to lose as much weight as possible . 
He seems both very interested in losing weight but at the same time somewhat cavalier an overly confident that he will be able to do so . 
I think the most important thing is going to be dietary management , since I doubt he will ever be able to do enough physical activity to burn sufficient calories to lose weight on that basis alone . 
We will check his Chem - 2 5 today as well as CRP , and I will review these results with him as soon as they are available . 
I also asked him to check on his blood pressure at home and let me know the results . 
If any problems develop in the interim , please do not hesitate to contact me . 
We will hopefully be able to identify his preop risk factor status with his perfusion scan within the next week . 
Thank you for allowing me to help with his care . 
Kindest personal regards . 
He is a 6 1 - year - old man with CAD , DM , high cholesterol , HTN , and family history of early CAD , who had a stress test that showed peri - infarct ischemia in the left circumflex and PDA . 
Angiography showed a codominant system , a 1 0 0 percent left circumflex occlusion , an 8 5 percent RC lesion , and nonobstructive LAD lesions . 
The left circumflex was recanalized and a Taxus 2 . 5 mm by 3 2 mm stent was placed . 
The procedure was done with Angiomax and the sheath was pulled manually . 
There were no complications . 
He spent an uneventful evening without complaints or complications , ambulating without difficulty . 
His groin was soft and tender with ecchymosis but no hematoma . 
Extremities were warm with 1 + edema to the ankles ; pulses were 2 + throughout . 
Morning labs included cholesterol of 1 1 4 , triglycerides 1 0 9 , HDL 3 4 and LDL 5 8 . 
He was discharged home on NPH insulin ; Mucomyst , 6 0 0 mg bid ; aspirin , 3 2 5 mg qd ; atenolol , 2 5 mg qd ; Lasix , 6 0 mg qd ; glyburide , 1 0 mg qd ; lisinopril , 4 0 mg qd ; Lipitor , 4 0 mg qd ; Diovan , 8 0 mg qd ; Plavix , 7 5 mg qd ; metformin , 5 0 0 mg bid to be restarted on 0 3 / 2 3 / 8 5 ; and sublingual nitroglycerin , prn chest pain . 
He will require aspirin for life and Plavix for six months ; he will not stop either medication unless told to do so by you . 
His HDL is low and given his degree of atherosclerosis , you may wish to start gemfibrozil or Niaspan . 
He will see you in follow - up in the next two weeks . 
Thank you for allowing us to share in his care . 
Please call if you have questions .

X - ray of the foot revealed left ankle fracture , for which she was placed in a walking cast . 
She also had cervical and retropharyngeal abscesses , for which she underwent cervical decompression and drainage of cervical abscesses , from C 2 - C 7 , with instrumentation and fusion from C 3 - C 7 , on [ * * 2 1 8 3 - 1 - 8 * * ] . 
Retropharyngeal abcesses were drained , and she had bilateral knee arthrocentesis and washout for septic joints . 
Pt was treated with vancomycin after nafcillin resulted in rash ( pt seen by derm , termed " drug hypersensitivity " ) . 
In addition , on [ * * 1 - 3 * * ] pt noted to have SVT , with rate up to the 1 6 0 s , and SBP decrease . 
She was cardioverted x 2 and started on amiodarone , which has since been discontinued . 
Pt seen by cardiology , without apparent further recommendation . 
Pt most recently taken to OR on [ * * 2 1 8 3 - 1 - 2 5 * * ] for debridement of postoperative lumbar wound , and decompression of L 4 - 5 and repair of dural leak after pt was persistently febrile and MRI of lumbar spine showed fluid collection ( + GPC per aspiration ) . 
Pt last febrile on [ * * 1 - 2 5 * * ] . 
Pt exubated on [ * * 1 - 2 1 * * ] per notes , and now breathing comfortably on RA .

Bilateral pleural effusions . 
No pulmonary embolus identified . 
Multiple old fractures of the ribs bilaterally at different stages . 
Some are clearly healed , some are healing and some appear somewhat acute .

There is a very small pericardial effusion . 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade . 
Overall improved prevertebral area of abscess seen on [ * * 2 1 8 3 - 1 - 6 * * ] . 
Secondary to inadequate post - contrast T 1 - weighted images , the tissue remaining in this area could represent either persistent abscess versus postoperative changes . 
If clinically indicated , a repeat , contrast - enhanced scan could be performed . 
Unchanged intraspinal epidural signal that overall appears less extensive compared to previous exam . 
New hyperintense signal at the T 2 to T 3 interspace could represent progression of discitis . 
Likely bilateral pleural effusions . 
Infectious etiology cannot be ruled out based on these images secondary to poor post - contrast study .

He was in his usual state of health when one week PTA he decided to abruptly discontinue his Fentanyl patch , which he had for three years at 7 5 mg for pain associated with peripheral neuropathy and gastroparesis . 
He recently decided he no longer wanted to wear the patch because he was concerned about personality changes and side effects of the medication . 
His PCP instructed him to taper the medication , switching him to a 5 0 mg patch , but Mr . Kaufman removed the patch without a taper . 
He felt fine for a few days , but began to experience pain in his feet , LE edema , insomnia and rhinorrhea . 
On the day of admission , he was watching television when he experienced the acute onset of shortness of breath and chest tightness .

The patient continued IV antibiotic treatment with vancomycin . 
The patient was transferred back to the medicine floor on [ * * 7 - 2 7 * * ] from the MICU . 
The patient was briefly transitioned to Nafcillin on [ * * 7 - 3 1 * * ] ; however , subsequent blood work revealed [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] and likely AIN , with Cr plateauing at 1 . 9 , up from her baseline of 1 . 1 - 1 . 4 . 
This prompted the patient ' s return to Vancomycin . 
Her BP has been stable on the medicine floor , with SBPs ranging from 1 2 0 s to 1 4 0 s . 
During the patient ' s stay in the hospital , she became gradually more edematous , with upper and lower extremity anasarca . 
Pt ' s Albumin was noted to be at 2 . 
Pt developed [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] with CR 1 . 9 after lasix diuresis and nafcillin induction on [ * * 8 - 3 1 * * ] . 
Eos in urine on [ * * 7 - 3 1 * * ] , since resolved , prompted concern for AIN . 
The patient has been transitioned back to Vancomycin , and her renal function has been stable . 
The patient will be discharged to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] on Vancomycin . 
Per our renal consult , we started the patient on [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] albumin ( 2 5 g IV ) chased one hour after with 1 0 mg lasix . 
This promoted successful diuresis , and the patient has been stable on this regimen . 
CT confirmed the presence of loculated pleural effusions . 
Pt is s / p bilateral VATS on the left side [ * * 2 1 2 2 - 7 - 2 1 * * ] and the right side on [ * * 2 1 2 2 - 7 - 2 4 * * ] . 
Pt received b / l drainage and pleural biopsy . 
The last chest tube was successfully removed on [ * * 2 1 2 2 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] , and subsequent CXR has shown no return of effusions with notmal lung spaces . 
Cultures from empyemas were positive for MSSA . 
Pt ' s dyspnea resolved s / p VATS . 
Pt ' s pain has been effectively controlled with Dilaudid PO 4 mg Q 4 H PRN ; oxycodone 2 0 mg PO BID . 
Pt has been relatively pain free with only ocasional need for the Dilaudid . 
She had her port removed , with the area debrided . 
Wet to dry dressings have been applied to the surgical site , with marked improvement of the wound . 
There has been no return of purulence since surgery , and her penrose drain was removed [ * * 2 1 2 2 - 7 - 1 5 * * ] . 
The wound shows evidence of good granulation tissue . 
Cultures from the infected port grew MSSA . 
Pt has been consistently guaiac negative , and a hemolytic work - up was negative for hemolysis . 
At time of discharge , Pt ' s hematocrit is at 2 5 . 
Since returning from the ICU , pt has received 2 units of blood on [ * * 7 - 3 1 * * ] , with hematocrit stable at 2 5 since . 
Her next dose is due on [ * * 2 1 2 2 - 8 - 3 1 * * ] . 
Atypical epithelial cells suspicious for malignancy were present in tissue taken from pleural empyema . 
B / L empyemas may have had a malignant component .

Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis although a second location of consolidation / infection not excluded . 
Additionally , subtle opacity at the lateral left mid lung , while could relate to overlying soft tissue , additional focus of consolidation is not excluded . 
On the left , an area of parenchymal opacity , previously qualified as potential pneumonia , has increased in extent . 
There is a newly occurred small reactive left - sided pleural effusion with subsequent left atelectasis . 
The diameter of the pulmonary vessels is minimally increased , potentially reflecting mild fluid overload . 
Widespread rapidly evolving multilobar pneumonia , possibly complicated by ARDS . 
Small bilateral simple layering pleural effusions . 
ACUTE DIAGNOSES : # Multilobar Pneumonia , likely bacterial : CTA results showed significant tri - lobar PNA which appeared significant enough for shunting to explain his degree of hypoxia . 
His PNA was treated and oxygen was weaned down and he tolerated walking around floor with nasal cannula , though he wore face tent at baseline for comfort . 
He was initially treated for CAP but because he works in a health - care setting and considering the extent of PNA with hypoxia he was treated for HCAP coverage with IV vancomycin , cefepime , and ciprofloxacin . 
On the floor he quickly weaned down to room air and was breathing comfortably with occasionally sputum tinged with blood . 
He was discharged on a 1 0 - day course of levofloxacin & linezolid , to cover ensure coverage of both MSRA and other usual CAP organisms . 
He was treated with a 1 0 mg / hr Dilt drip and spontaneously converted to sinus and he remained in sinus rhythm throughout the rest of his hospitalization . 
Although he has a history of palpitations in the past ( and has been on a Holter monitor ) , this is his first episode of atrial fibrillation . 
Given his CHADS 2 score of 0 - 1 it was felt that he did not require anything other than a daily aspirin ( which he has been taking as an outpatient ) . 
The aspirin was held due to intermittent hemoptysis / blood streaked sputum , but Dr . [ * * Known lastname 2 3 * * ] was advised to discuss reinitiation of aspirin as an outpatient . 
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES : None . 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES : # Follow - Up : The patient was instructed to follow up with his new primary care doctor within 1 - 2 weeks . 
He was told to discuss reinitation of aspirin with his PCP when his hemoptysis ceases . 
He should also be screened for hypertension , as it was noted that his blood pressure was elevated to the 1 4 0 s - 1 5 0 s systolic while he was on the floor .

Discharge Instructions : Dr . [ * * Known lastname 2 3 * * ] , it was a pleasure to participate in your care while you were hospital . 
You were initially admitted to the MICU on a diltiazem drip to control your rapid atrial fibrillation . 
You had an ongoing oxygen requirement and it was discovered that you had a multifocal pneumonia . 
You were treated with broad - spectrum IV antibiotics , which were transitioned to PO antibiotics a day prior to your discharge . 
MEDICATION CHANGES : - Medications ADDED : Linezolid 6 0 0 mg Q 1 2 H for 1 0 days - Medications ADDED : Guaifenesin - CODEINE cough syrup as needed for cough - Medications STOPPED : Aspirin - Medications CHANGED : None .

The patient was feeling well , but then developed URI symptoms ( fevers , headache , ear pain ) four day prior to admission . 
She then had persistent myalgias and nausea with worsening headaches over one to two days PTA > She felt very " cold " the night PTA when she asked her husband to turn up the heat . 
On the AM of admission , he tried to wake her up when leaving for work and she was unresponsive , barely opening her eyes to voice and not following commands . 
He called EMS and she was brought to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
The patient had no previous HIB or Pneumococcal vaccination . 
There was no rash , bruising , or mouth sores . 
Her husband had a mild " cold " a few days before her . 
ROS : Two months of intermittent headaches . 
ED : Received Ceftriaxone 2 grams IV , Vanco 1 gram IV , Acyclovir 8 0 0 mg IV and Ativan / Tylenol . 
HEENT : R PRRL , L prosthesis ; + photophobia Neck : + neck stiffness Heart : RRR , S 1 , S 2 , no m / r / g LUngs ; CTBLA , no rales or wheezing ABd : S / NT / ND / no masses Ext : no edema Derm : no rash Neuro : R PRRL , uncooperative , opens L eye to command , moves feet to command to move feet or arms , nonverbal , flipped over in the prone position during examination . 
Brief Hospital Course : Mrs [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 6 1 0 6 4 * * ] presented to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] with obtundation after several days of URI symptoms - she was admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] . 
A CSF examination revealed Hemophilus influenza meningitis and she was cotniued on Ceftriaxone , after Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued . 
Her neurologic status improved dramatically and she recovered full function . 
However , her course was complicated by persistent fatigue , hyponatremia ( deemed secondary to meningitis - related SIADH ) , fever , leukocytosis and an inflammatory CSF . 
Follow - up head imaging showed a right frontal sinus opacification with possible right frontal osteomyeltis . 
Her right frontal sinus was surgically evaluated and drained . 
Her fevers persisted and no clear alternate source of infection was found - in her liver , blood , urine ( although she had urine with yeast and no signs of inflammation ) , or chest . 
Bacterial Meningitis / Fever : Again , the patient presented with obtundation and an inflammatory CSF after URI symptoms . 
She was admitted to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] for a short course and improved dramatically on Ceftriaxone , Vancomycin and Acyclovir . 
Once Hemophilus influenza was cultured from her admission CSF and BCXRs , Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued . 
Although she improved neurologically , she had persistent fever and increased serum WBCs . 
Repeat - LPs showed increased CSF WBCs ( to 2 5 0 0 ) . 
She also had persistent tachycardia , presumed secondary to fever . 
Her antibiotics were changed to Meropenem , Levofloxacin and then empiric Vancomycin . 
Head and spine imaging showed opacification of the left frontal sinus , possible frontal osteomyelitis and possible underlying meningeal enhancement , but no abscesses . 
Her distal thecal sac and cauda equina were markedly enhancing and her cauda equina nerve roots were markedly thickened . 
These findings were consistent with meningitis . 
Her right frontal sinus was surgically evaluated by ENT and drains were placed . 
Of note , no purulent material drained from her sinus ; she had only marked mucosal edema . 
A repeat CSF cytology showed decreasing WBC and increasing glucose , indicating overall improving meningitis . 
Given signs of improving meningitis by CSF studies and likely drug fever from meropenem , meropenem was d / c and the pt was placed back on levoflox with good effect . 
Fever resolved after 4 8 hours off meropenem , and there no signs of active infection after starting levoflox . 
At the time of d / c , the pt has been afebrile > 4 8 hours and is near her neurologic baseline on levoflox . 
She will continue levofloxacin after d / c until f / u with [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic . 
Hyponatremia : She was euvolemic to hypovolemic and had a hypotonic serum . 
Her sodim levels downtrended intiailly with normal saline hydration and she nadired at 1 2 3 . 
Her clinical picture and urine electrolytes were consitent with SIADH in setting of meningitis . 
She improved slightly with fluid restriction but also required small boluses of hypertonic saline . 
Renal service was consulted and recommended salt tablets . 
She was treated w / NaCl 3 gm PO TID , resulting in marked improvement in hyponatremia . 
At d / c , she is asymptomatic w / stable sodium . 
She will need to continue fluid restriction to < 1 L per day after d / c , and will also continue NaCl tablets until f / u with her PCP . 
LDH / ALK PHOS / AST Elevation : She had an incidental rise in these values in the middle of her course . 
They were checked as a screen given her persistent fever . 
It was possibly related to high - dose Levofloxacin liver toxicity . 
An abdominal CT was negative for abscess . 
After levoflox was resumed towards the end of her hospital course , LFTs were followed and were stable . 
She will require ongoing monitoring of LFTs while taking levoflox . 
Left Diagphragmatic Hernia : This was discovered incidentally on chest x - ray . 
She was seen by surgery and a likely congenital ( Bochdalek ) diaphragatic hernia was diagnosed , without obvious lung aplasia or dysfunction . 
She was slotted for follow - up with surgery as an outpatient for possible elective correction . 
Hearing loss : she has bilateral hearing loss at the time of d / c , likely [ * * 1 - 8 * * ] meningitis . 
ENT recommends audiological evaluation after d / c , w / close follow - up for 6 months after resolution of meningitis . 
She will f / u in [ * * Hospital * * ] clinic after d / c for ongoing evaluation . 
Hypothyroidism : controlled w / her outpt dose of levoxyl during her admission . 
Code status was full code during this admission . 
Acetaminophen 3 2 5 mg Tablet Sig : Two ( 2 ) Tablet PO Q 4 - 6 H ( every 4 to 6 hours ) as needed for fever . 
Levothyroxine Sodium 1 0 0 mcg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO DAILY ( Daily ) . 
Alendronate Sodium 7 0 mg Tablet Sig : 0 . 5 Tablet PO QMON ( every Monday ) . 
Sodium Chloride 1 g Tablet Sig : Three ( 3 ) Tablet PO TID ( 3 times a day ) .

Please take this with you to your appointment with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 7 4 4 4 * * ] on Monday . 
Follow - up appointment for frontal sinus drain with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] to follow at 2 : 3 0 pm , same location . 
Please arrive around 1 5 min before your first appointment . 
Repair could potentially be performed laproscopically , call the office to come discuss the surgical options in an office visit . 
She was referred to us by Dr . Michael . 
Ms . Yount has a history of diabetes mellitus for the last seven years . 
She also has a long history of hypertension . 
She retired from IBM in 2 0 8 5 after working there for many years . 
Her last posting was as a electrical mechanic . 
She is feeling well . 
She denies headaches , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain . 
She also denies shortness of breath or complex partial seizures . 
She denies swelling and presence of dysuria , fever , chills . 
She is taking her medications regularly . 
Diabetes mellitus for about seven years . 
Hypertension . 
She has one son living with her . 
She denies chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , dysuria , fever , chills . 
Blood pressure is 1 4 8 / 9 0 . 
Body weight is 1 8 8 . 
Repeat blood pressure is 1 7 0 / 8 0 . 
On examination of head and neck - no absolutely . 
Thyroid is soft , nontender , no nodules . 
Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation . 
Heart - regular rate and rhythm , no S 3 . 
Abdomen is soft , bowel sounds present . 
Extremities - trace edema . 
Her urine shows presence of protein , which suggests diabetic nephropathy . 
However , today the blood pressure is running higher . 
I will see her in about two to three months . 
If her blood pressure continues to be high , we should try to increase her dose of ARB . 
I also explained to Ms . Yount the importance of taking aspirin and that she should continue her daily aspirin . 
Patricia is a 7 0 - year - old retired woman , right - hand dominant , who comes with complaints of soreness in her right wrist . 
She apparently had a fall , which caused substantial pain and some swelling , but no bruising . 
Brought her in to have an evaluation . 
X - rays showed no fracture and over the last few weeks things have improved substantially , and she comes in just because she was told to get it checked out by her doctors , but otherwise feeling quite good and wondering if the appointment is even necessary . 
Past medical history includes high blood pressure and diabetes . 
No prior surgeries . 
No medications . 
No known drug allergies . 
Lists no family history of any problems . 
Lives alone and used to smoke , but quit . 
On examination , she has full range of motion of her wrist compared to the opposite side . 
No atrophy , ecchymosis , edema or deformity . 
Negative scaphoid shift test . 
Slight tenderness over the distal radius . 
Normal tendon function . 
My impression is that she must have got a mild sprain , which has recovered or possibly even a nondisplaced fracture given her age and osteoporotic bone , but whatever this was , it has resolved almost entirely , she is functioning well , and there is no apparent problem , so I will see her back as needed . 
Her last hemoglobin A 1 c was 7 % . 
She saw her eye doctor last year who recommended seeing her in another two years . 
She is on Lipitor . 
She is on Cozaar . 
Th patient was well and normally active with walking and usual activities without DOE until 2 days ago . 
Last routine visit was in 9 / 9 1 w / her PCP and was fine . 
This persisted w / activity only . 
The patient was fine at rest and was able to sleep without difficulty . 
There were no recent changes in her meds . 
She had no other symptoms including CP , dizziness , URI symptoms , fever , chills , GI symptoms . 
No PND , orthopnea . 
She previously had a cardiac evaluation during a similar presentation in 2 0 8 5 . 
She had a low level stress test and echocardiogram . 
No ischemia was demonstrated at a very minimal exertion . 
The echo showed LVH and an EF of 6 1 % . 
Because of an impending snow storm , she decided to come to the hospital for evaluation . 
In the ED her BP was elevated and her 0 2 sat was only 7 8 % on RA . 
Diabetes mellitus : on medical regimen , HgA 1 c 7 . 3 ( 9 / 9 1 ) . 
Hypertension : Blood pressure is 1 4 0 / 7 2 . 
Echocardiogram 1 2 / 8 5 - EF 6 1 % , LVH . 
ETT 1 2 / 8 5 - 4 METS , no wall motion abnormalities . 
Hypercholesterolemia : on Lipitor 1 0 , LDL 7 8 ( 4 / 9 1 ) . 
She is well collateralized across the ankles at rest and poorly collateralized across the ankles post exercise . 
Anemia : normocytic normochromic anemia with a normal SPEP and UPEP and iron studies . 
Baseline hematocrit of low 3 0 ' s . 
Obesity . 
Osteopenia with a history of right radial fracture . 
SOCIAL HISTORY : Lives in Glencoe . 
Has one son . 
Originally from Clearlake . 
Previously worked as a engineer at IBM research , retried a few yrs ago . 
Exercises twice a wk for 1 / 2 hour , aerobic exercises and treadmill at the gym . 
FAMILY HISTORY : Father has DM . 
One sister diabetes father - diabetes . 
NECK : supple , no JVD . 
CHEST : fine crackles 1 / 3 bilaterally , no dullness to percussion . 
EXTR : no c / c / e , 2 + pulses . 
SKIN : no lesions noted . 
NEURO : A & Ox 3 , nonfocal . 
CT chest / abd / pelvis : 1 . 
No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries . 
However , evaluation of the pulmonary vasculature is suboptimal due to respiratory motion . 
No evidence for deep venous thrombosis . 
Small right pleural effusion . 
Intravenous contrast noted within the hepatic veins which could be secondary to CHF . 
EKG : NSR , LVH , 1 st degree AVB , nonspecific ST , TW changes . 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : 7 3 year old woman with hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia who presents with exertional dyspnea . 
The patient ' s history , exam and CXR are not consistent with CHF . 
The CT scan r / o PE and may be consistent w / failure , but not clear . 
More likely would be ischemia and is ruling out for an MI . 
Clearly needs cardiac reassessment with echo and ETT . 
Last ETT in 2 0 8 5 but was normal at a very low level of exertion . 
If her 0 2 sat of 7 8 % in the ED is true , this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative . 
Specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w / fine crackles . 
Arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms . 
Continue current regimen w / holding Avandia and metformin . 
Patricia is a 7 3 yo female from Clearlake with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary venoocclusive disease by bx in 4 / 9 2 with chronic hypoxia on n / c oxygen , diastolic dysfunction , HTN , diabetes , chronic renal insufficiency and hyperlipidemia . 
She was discharged from SBH in 4 / 9 2 and had spent some time at PMSC prior to that . 
Has been doing fairly well at home over the last few months but presented with increasing shortness of breath . 
Denies chest pain , n / v / f / chills / cough , new orthopnea or edema or wt gain . 
She ' d been seen 2 - 3 weeks ago in the ED with similar symptoms and was successfully treated with IV lasix and sent home . 
Yesterday she was admitted to ED obs unit but because of persistent hypoxia and concern she is being transfered to medical service . 
In ED / obs unit given IV lasix , albuterol ( stopped d / t short run of Vtach ) . 
One sister diabetes father - diabetes . 
Has one son - - recently died . 
Originally from Clearlake . 
Previously worked as a engineer in IBM research , retried a few yrs ago . 
On chronic nasal canula oxygen at home 3 l / min . 
Able to get around house and out occasionally . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial pulmonary edema , consistent with CHF . 
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia . 
Her resting O 2 sats are back to baseline and she does not appear to be in significant decompensated failure . 
Unfortunately , we don ' t have much more to offer her in the way of cure ( she has declined other interventions with pulmonlogist ) , as this is generally a terminal illness . 
This might help forgo further hosptilizations with similar treatment at home . 
On [ * * 2 1 4 7 - 7 - 1 4 * * ] , he awoke feeling generally unwell . 
His wife called EMS and - en route to [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] Hospital - the patient had a generalized convulsion . 
The patient had a second generalized convulsion upon entry to the [ * * Location ( un ) * * ] ER , he developed a massive tongue hematoma from a tongue bite , and underwent a difficult and prolonged intubation process . 
INR was 3 . 2 , which was in the appropriate range given the mechanical valve . 
NCHCT revealed ICH and SAH . 
He was loaded with 1 gram of dilantin and transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , CTA revealed left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to parietal sulci , 4 - mm aneurysm at the left MCA bifurcation pointing laterally , 2 to 2 . 5 mm aneurysm arising from the A 2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery at the level of ventricular bodies . 
In the ED , the patient received Factor 9 and 1 unit FFP . 
He subsequently received 6 units of platelets and FFP to reverse his coagulopathy . 
He was started on nimodipine and HOB was kept > 3 0 degrees . 
Since there would be no further surgical intervention , the patient was transferred to the Neurology team in the ICU . 
Occasional EtOH use .

IMAGING : . 
Admssion CTA CNS : 1 . 
Left sylvian fissure subarachnoid hemorrhage extending to parietal sulci . 
CT head [ * * 2 1 4 7 - 8 - 8 * * ] : No evidence of acute new hemorrhage . 
Area of prior hemorrhage in the left subinsular region is less apparent . 
MRI / A : CNS : 1 . 
The previously noted aneurysms on the left ACA and left MCA are not clearly identified in this examination . 
Sequela of a prior infarction is noted on the right cerebellar hemisphere . 
Restricted diffusion is noted on the left parietal lobe likely consistent with subacute ischemic changes , measuring approximately 6 x 7 mm . 
Cerebral arteriography : 2 - mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin of the anterior temporal branch . 
This was thought not to be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage as there was no history of headache at onset and the hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there was no blood in the basal cisterns at all . 
A second aneurysm measuring 1 . 5 - 2 mm was also located in the left pericallosal artery . 
The A 1 was dominant on the left side . 
TTE : Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional systolic dysfunction . 
Normal functioning aortic bileaflet prosthesis . 
At least mild mitral regurgitation . 
Left ICA stenosis < 4 0 % . 
CT chest / abd / pelvis ; 1 .

Gastric pull - up is visualized status post esophagectomy for esophageal cancer . 
RUQ U / S : Slight increased echogenicity in the liver . 
More advanced forms of liver disease such as fibrosis / cirrhosis not excluded . 
Otherwise normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without evidence of biliary abnormality . 
Brief Hospital Course : # . 
He has bizarre / tangential speech at times , and becomes temporarily confused . 
He has 5 / 5 strength in upper extremities , 4 - / 5 in lower extremities at both proximal and distal muscles , thought to be secondary to deconditioning and ICU myopathy ( not due to stroke ) . 
He has 2 + reflexes on right , 1 + on left . 
Upgoing Babinski on right . 
Head CT showed left - sided intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage . 
It was unknown whether bleeding was the precipitating event , followed by seizure due to parenchymal irritation ; or , if seizure occurred initially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led to bleeding . 
The patient was loaded with Dilantin and then initiated on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does not interact with coumadin . 
He had no further seizure activity int he ICU . 
After transfer to the medical floor , the patient had an episode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair , witnessed only by wife . 
This was thought unlikely to represent seizure activity , and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep . 
Neurology was called to see patient at this time . 
The patient will continue on Keppra for at least 6 months . 
He will follow - up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] in neurology . 
ICH : The patient underwent a conventional angiogram which did show 2 - mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the origin of the anterior temporal branch . 
However , this was thought not to be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage as there was no history of headache at onset and the hemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and there was no blood in the basal cisterns at all . 
He did have an intraparenchimal bleed with a SAH component that may have been due to amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds in GRE . 
These added to his age and PV white matter disease placed him at a higher risk for a new bleed . 
However , he needed to remain anticoagulated because of his mechanical valve . 
Thoracic surgery was consulted about the possibility of pursuing a valve replacement for a biological prosthesis to avoid anticoagulation . 
However , the surgical risk was determined to outweigh the benefit of avoiding anticoagulation . 
The patient remained off anticoagulation due to this high risk . 
On [ * * 7 - 1 8 * * ] , the patient developed new right - sided weakness and MRI showed new left MCA infarct . 
This was thought to have originated from AVR thromboembolization . 
Heparin was resumed for goal PTT 4 0 - 6 0 and coumadin was resumed [ * * 8 - 1 * * ] . 
Several repeat head CT have all been stable , most recent [ * * 2 1 4 7 - 8 - 8 * * ] . 
Heparin infusion was stopped once a therapeutic INR was reached on warfarin . 
Retroperitoneal Bleed : After the patient had a stroke off anticoagulation , heparin was resumed . 
Shortly after , the patient developed worsening anemia with HCT eventually falling to 1 9 . 
He received a total of 1 5 units pRBCs during the hospital course . 
His systolic blood pressure dropped to the 8 0 s and he became tachycardic . 
A CT abd / pelvis revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma . 
He required very aggressive transfusion of RBCs and underwent evacuation of hematoma by vascular surgery on [ * * 7 - 2 7 * * ] . 
He tolerated the procedure well and hematocrit has been stable since the procedure . 
His heparin was resumed with goal PTT 4 0 - 6 0 on [ * * 7 - 3 0 * * ] and was restarted on coumadin [ * * 8 - 1 * * ] . 
The patient was transferred to the neuromedicine step - down service on [ * * 8 - 1 * * ] . 
He was noted to have intermittant fevers . 
CT of the torso and head did not reveal any new source . 
He became hypotensive and Hct continued to decrease . 
EKG was concerning for new T wave inversions and a stat ECHO showed possible anterior wall motion abnormality , most likely intracranial T waves . 
The patient responded to IV fluids and placement in trendelenberg . 
This event was presumed to be due to continued retroperitoneal bleeding . 
Anticoagulation was again held temporarily . 
The patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and INR was 3 . 0 on day of discharge . 
The patient ' s coumadin was being held for supratherapeutic INR prior to discharge . 
PT and PTT are elevated , likely due to poor nutritional status . 
INR will need to be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately to maintain goal range 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 . 
He should have daily INR checks and adjustment of dose to maintain INR 2 . 5 - 3 . 5 . 
At the time of discharge , he was restarted on coumadin 4 . 0 mg daily . 
His hematocrit is currently 2 7 . 9 and stable . 
Respiratory failure : The patient was intubated due to a large tongue hematoma . 
On [ * * 7 - 2 4 * * ] ( after extubation ) he was found to have increased respiration rate and work of breathing . 
He had a clot removed from his trachea by ENT with moderate resolution of symptoms . 
He is currently doing well on room air . 
Ventilator - associated PNA : The [ * * Hospital 2 2 8 * * ] hospital course was also complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis secondary to pneumonia while intubated . 
He underwent 2 bronchoscopies with BAL and samples grew klebsiella , serratia , and staph aureus . 
He completed a 1 2 - day course of antibiotics , initially started on vancomycin and cefepime . 
He is currently afebrile with no leukocytosis . 
Gout : The patient developed erythema , swelling and pain of the left 1 st MTP joint , consistent with gout . 
He has a prior history of gout , so no joint aspiration was done . 
The patient responded well to colchicine with reduced pain and inflammation . 
Left knee trauma : The patient fell from bed in MICU . 
X - ray showed possible small nondisplaced tibial fracture , but unable to see joint line . 
The patient was weight bearing well with PT .

Followup Instructions : [ * * 2 1 4 7 - 8 - 1 7 * * ] 2 : 0 0 Vascular Surgery ; [ * * First Name 1 1 ( Name Pattern 1 ) 1 1 1 2 * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) 2 6 0 4 * * ] , MD Phone : [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 1 2 3 7 * * ] . 
He was in his usual state of health , active and playing golf , until [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] when he began to become " confused " and developed gait difficulties . 
According to the family , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family members . 
Because of these symptoms , he was evaluated at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] Hospital on [ * * 8 - 1 7 * * ] . 
At that time , a head computed tomography was reported as normal . 
He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic attacks and was d / c home . 
Over the next three days , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] problems gradually worsened . 
On [ * * 8 - 2 0 * * ] , he was at home when he developed a nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized . 
He was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he continued to have generalized seizures . 
He was given a Dilantin load and phenobarbital . 
His systolic blood pressure at that time ranged between 1 2 0 and 2 0 0 s . 
A repeat head CT was reported to be normal . 
Despite the Dilantin load and the phenobarbiltal , the patient continued to have clinical seizured . 
Therefore , he was started on an Ativan drip and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit . 
His Dilantin was also continued on therapeutic levels . 
Despite the Ativan drip and Dilantin therapeutic levels , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] continued to be unresponsive and had intermittent seizures . 
The rate of the Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated . 
A lumbar puncture was performed on [ * * 8 - 2 0 * * ] at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] Hospital and showed normal values . 
A MRI with diffusion - weighted imaging showed diffuse hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex ( R > L ) and both thalami . 
At this point , the patient remained intubated and unresponsive and was therefore transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further evaluation and care . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 1 . 
Hodgkin ' s disease diagnosed in [ * * 2 1 0 6 - 4 - 1 1 * * ] after developing a respiratory infection . 
This was diagnosed as nodular sclerosing Hodgkin ' s disease ; stage III - B with positive [ * * Doctor Last Name * * ] - Sternberg cells . 
A bone marrow biopsy was done in [ * * 2 1 0 6 - 8 - 1 1 * * ] which showed no bone marrow involvement . 
Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin , Cytoxan , vincristine , and procarbazine two years ago . 
This had to be discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of neutropenic fever . 
Most recent surveillance computed tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of Hodgkin ' s disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph nodes . 
Borderline hypertension . 
Colonic polyps . 
Tuberculosis . 
Cataracts . 
Macular degeneration . 
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside hospital . 
He was married with no alcohol or intravenous drug use . 
A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells , glucose and protein . 
A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures and different viral and fungal Ab titers ( including West Nile Virus , Arboviruses , HSV , HBVs ) . 
Routine cultures for bacterial , TB and other infectious agents were also normal . 
Cytology was normal . 
Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of Ativan , electroencephalogram ( EEG ) on admission showed epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing epileptict activity . 
Therefore , a Penotarbital infusion was started . 
The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a burst - suppression pattern on bedside 2 4 h , EEG monitoring . 
In particular , the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 1 0 seconds . 
Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well . 
At this point , pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital - induced decreased cardiac function . 
Mr [ * * Known lastname * * ] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance imaging examination ( [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] ) showed multicentric areas of T 2 hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as well as bilateral thalami . 
Laboratory studies throughout Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] admission included several blood cultures , urine cultures and extensive toxic metabolic workup . 
Another LP for cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection , toxic metabolic and cytological analysis was also performed . 
In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology . 
A brain and meningeal biopsy was performed on [ * * 8 - 2 4 * * ] in the right frontal lobe . 
In regards to empiric treatment , after the brain biopsy , the patient received IV Solu - Medrol and high doses of antibiotics with broad coverage . 
The Infectious Disease team was also involved in the care of Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] . 
All the tests performed on his tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team , had thus far come back normal . 
Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal damage ( red neurons ) . 
There was no evidence of an infectious [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 6 0 * * ] on traditional staining and / or on electronic microscopy . 
Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] condition deteriorated even further . 
He had developed ileus , and his abdomen was hyperextended . 
He had been intubated throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was increasingly dependent on ventilatory support . 
After a family meeting , it was decided that Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] would no longer benefit from aggressive support . 
Therefore , he was extubated and expired briefly thereafter .

This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 1 8 months ago , using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time . 
Also related , at least in part , to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non - ST elevation MI in December 2 0 7 4 . 
Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent - left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting , going away before she has time to try a SLTNG . 
In addition , Ms . Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower , on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis , which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal . 
She is on a STTh HD schedule , but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD . 
She did not go to HD today , as her SBP was again too low .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 1 . 
End - stage renal disease . 
Because of her original end - stage renal disease was reportedly FSGS , she had a preemptive transplant in 2 0 6 8 , which was complicated by rejection and ultimate loss of the graft . 
She resumed dialysis in 2 0 7 2 . 
She had a second transplant in 2 0 7 5 , which was also complicated and ultimately rejected . 
She resumed hemodialysis in 2 0 8 2 . 
She does have a match with her only daughter , but apparently the Transplant Service feels that she would not be a good candidate and I think she would be reluctant to go through two surgeries , which would be required , one to remove the old graft and one for the new transplant . 
She currently is dialyzed at the Overbrook Hospital . 
Her dialysis physician is Dr . Lemus . 
Hypertension . 
Peripheral vascular disease . 
She had an angiogram in 2 0 8 3 at LMC and an MRA in 2 0 8 5 , which showed bilateral iliac and femoral artery stenoses . 
She apparently does not have claudication despite this . 
History of right foot - drop . 
She had a severe episode of shingles in 2 0 7 7 with associated sciatica and foot - drop . 
History of hemorrhoids for at least six years with occasional bleeding and with anal protrusion . 
History of CMV colitis in 0 8 / 2 0 8 1 .

She is on Sensipar and has been on this since early 2 0 8 5 . 
She is status post appendectomy . 
She is status post bilateral cataract surgery . 
She is a lifetime nonsmoker . 
She does not drink alcohol or use drugs . 
She is a retired mathematician at Vassar . 
She came from Turlock 1 0 years ago to Pecos to be with her daughter who is a surgeon in the area . 
She never has felt the Pecos as home and is home sick for Turlock . 
She generally seems to be somewhat overwhelmed and a little bit sad . 
She seems never to have adjusted to life in Pecos . 
She has had the loss of two the kidney transplants and then the foot - drop , which has made walking difficult . 
She did have a brace at one time , which helped her to walk , but it was irritating . 
She had seen Dr . Yim to get another one , but that never worked out . 
She did not complain of any chest pain or shortness of breath , no constipation . 
She does have hemorrhoids that are active as above . 
Her blood pressure is 1 4 0 / 6 0 . 
HEENT , pupils equal , round and reactive to light . 
Extraocular movements are intact . 
Throat is clear . 
Neck , supple , no adenopathy or thyromegaly . 
Heart , regular rate and rhythm . 
Lungs , clear . 
Abdomen , soft , nontender , no organomegaly . 
Extremities , no edema . 
Neuro , absent reflex in the right patella and 2 + in the left patella . 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : 1 .

We may look into this further and perhaps get some physical therapy for possible rotator cuff tendinitis . 
Hemorrhoids . 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism on Sensipar . 
Health maintenance . 
Mammogram was done in 0 6 / 2 0 8 6 . 
Pap smear was done in 0 4 / 2 0 8 3 .

Persistent pulmonary embolism involving the right main pulmonary artery extending into the right middle and lower lobes but with no evidence of right heart strain . 
Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis .

A CTA was done showing clot in right main pulmonary artery and branch arteries in the LLL . 
He was started on heparin . 
Attempt was made to put him in 6 L NC , but he became tachpyneic and [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 5 2 5 3 6 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] he went back on a non - rebreather .

Pan - cultured . 
U / A negative . 
Initially thought it was [ * * 3 - 1 2 * * ] agitation / delirium - was given Zyprexa . 
Also thought pt had large cuff leak contributing to increased secretions and aspiration leading to VAP . 
Thoracics came back and was unimpressed .

ARDS vs fluid overload ( causing non - AG met acidosis and worsening CXR ) , vs infectious process vs PE vs DAH 2 ' rheum condition . 
Please see prior Discharge Summary by Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] summarizing the patient ' s Intensive Care Unit hospital course . 
The patient was maintained on a one - to - one security sitter after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit to the medicine floor . 
The patient remained fairly anxious . 
The patient was given Valium per CIWA scale . 
The patient received sedation in the Intensive Care Unit and had baseline agitation anxiety , also with a depressed mental status secondary to sedation in the Intensive Care Unit . 
The patient was followed by the Psychiatry Service who recommended continuing standing as needed Haldol and security sitter . 
The patient ' s home dose psychiatric medications were held given his mental status . 
His home dose psychiatric medications included Effexor , BuSpar , and Seroquel ; and these were not given to the patient during this time period . 
The patient remained stable from a medical point of view ; however , the patient remained on the Medicine Service and was followed by the Psychiatry team . 
Consideration for transfer to inpatient psychiatric facility was recommended by the medical team . 
The patient was requesting to leave repeatedly . 
The patient felt somewhat slowed but did not feel confused and was less agitated . 
However , the Psychiatry Service recommended maintaining the one - to - one sitter and as needed Haldol . 
His Effexor was restarted as well as his BuSpar ; however , Seroquel was still held . 
Given that the patient was at risk of elopment , a discussion with Psychiatry resulted in discontinuation of the one - to - one security sitter , Haldol was discontinued , and the patient was deemed ready to be discharged to home with follow up with his primary care physician . 
Per report , the patient did elope even though he was medically ready to be discharged . 
His wife reports that he did not complain of any of the above on the morning of admission , either . 
Per his wife , the pt awoke early this morning , which is unusual , and was c / o some R shoulder pain ( the site of the vaccination . 
He was just a little " off , " and he fell in the living room . 
Both he and his wife deny loss of consciousness . 
Past Medical History : 1 . 
Bipolar disorder . 
History of rheumatic heart disease . 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease . 
History of hepatitis . 
Status post cholecystectomy . 
Status post appendectomy . 
History of alcohol abuse . 
FE deficient anemia followed by hematology and on IV iron therapy 1 0 . 
He was treated as a beta - blocker overdose and given IVF ( ~ 2 L NS ) and glucagon , with improvement in his hemodynamics . 
He had a CXR , CTA and CT torso , all of which were unrevealing . 
He recieved empiric broad spectrum antibiotics ( metronidazole 5 0 0 mg IV , levofloxacin 7 5 0 mg IV and vancomycin 1 g IV ) and was transferred to the medical floor . 
On the floor , he developed rigors , fevers to 1 0 4 . 1 with tachycardia to the 1 1 0 s and hypoxemia to 8 8 % on RA . 
There was no witnessed aspiration event , although the pt does have a h / o aspiration for which he was treated at an OSH . 
He received a dose of diazepam for possible EtOH withdrawal that had no immediate effect . 
Of note , the pt did receive a pneumococcal vaccination on the day prior to admission . 
On transfer to the ICU , the pt reported feeling well . 
He denied shortness of breath , and reported that the arm pain that he presented with had gotten better . 
He denies lightheadedness , neck stiffness , cough , sputum production , diarrhea , abdominal pain , dysuria . 
ICU COURSE ; Fever hypotension / Shock : Given the pt ' s history of aspiration , considered aspiration pneumonitis . 
Although he did not have a witnessed aspiration event , his wife reports a nearly identical admission ~ 2 years ago . 
Also in the differential were pulmonary embolism , an intrabdominal source of infection with associated sepsis , a reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine - which chronologically fits well with the story / cytokine like effect , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , serotonin syndrome . 
PE is unlikely given his normal CTA . 
An intrabdominal infection is unlikely given his normal CT scan and abdominal exam . 
A reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine is the most likely factor at this point as there is no signs of infection / endocrine phenomenon . 
His CK is not elevated , and he is not rigid on exam , making NMS unlikely . 
He is , if anything , hyporeflexive , making serotonin syndrome unlikely . 
As his hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia it is felt likely that an etiology could be beta blocker overdose ( not felt to be intentional ) . 
TSH was normal . 
An EKG showed 1 st degree AVB . 
He was given IV fluids , stress dose steroids , vanco / levo / flagyl for broad empiric coverage and pan cultured . 
A CXR on [ * * 7 - 8 * * ] showed ? LLL infitlrate vs atelectasis . 
Diuresis with 1 0 mg IV lasix was performed and a PA and LAT were done after diuresis that showed a retrocardiac density , no overload but clinical suspicion of pneumonia was low . 
An echo did not show any vegetations . 
Pneumovax was added to his allergy list . 
He did not have symptoms such as cough / SOB / wheeze . 
Pt was given aggressive hydration on admission for hypotension . 
Resultant CXR showed this as well as crackles on exam . 
He autodiuresed once his BP had improved and his CXR showed improvement in hilar edema . 
Vanco was discontinued and levo / flagyl was continued until diuresis and repeat PA and LAT to assess LLL , CXR showed a left retrocardiac density ( pna vs atelectasis ) - however he no longer had an oxygen requirement even with ambulation . 
He will follow up with his PCP . 
He denies back pain , rectal exam was with normal tone , no saddle anesthesia , no paraspinal tenderness . 
Pt given prescription for bedside commode . 
He was instructed to seek medical attention if any symptoms of leg weakness , saddle anesthesia , back pain developed or if the incontinence continued at home . 
He was continued on flecainide . 
His metoprolol was held due to bradycardia . 
An echo showed LVEF 7 0 % , mild AS . 
Acetaminophen 5 0 0 mg Tablet Sig : 1 - 2 Tablets PO Q 6 H ( every 6 hours ) as needed for pain , fever . 
Flecainide 5 0 mg Tablet Sig : Two ( 2 ) Tablet PO Q 1 2 H ( every 1 2 hours ) .

Topiramate 2 5 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO BID ( 2 times a day ) . 
Citalopram 2 0 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO QHS ( once a day ( at bedtime ) ) . 
You had imaging of your head , chest , and abdomen without evidence of infection or blood clot in your lungs . 
You received antibiotics as infection was suspected . 
You had no evidence of a problem with your adrenal glands , or thyroid . 
It is believed that your low blood pressure was due to a reaction from your pneumovax that was given the day before . 
Also , since your heart rate was low it is possible that this was due to a high dose of beta blocker . 
In addition you had two episodes of fecal incontinence which you have had in the past when you are not home . 
Your rectal exam was normal . 
If this does not improve when you go home you need to seek medical attention . 
You have been given a prescription for a bedside commode . 
You should continue taking your medications as prescribed . 
You should not take your metoprolol until you follow up with with your PCP [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] .

This lovely 6 7 - year - old female ended up having no discernable coronary artery disease on catheterization . 
At the time of the cath , her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 1 2 . 
During the course of her hospitalization , we noted as well that she had had runs of nonsustained VT and asked our EP colleagues to comment on the appropriateness of an ICD . 
They felt that this could certainly be rediscussed in the future , but at the present time , there was no compelling indication for her to receive an ICD . 
Her medications at discharge include Lipitor 2 0 mg p . o . 
It has been a delight to participate in the care of this lovely woman . 
If there is any questions or issues , please feel free to call .

This is scheduled for next week and Mr . Jarvis is quite anxious about it . 
At first he developed a considerable cough but in the last two weeks this has largely resolved . 
He states that the cough is productive of thick phlegm and may reflect a respiratory infection rather than the Captopril itself . 
His blood sugars when checked at home have averaged between the 1 4 0 to 1 5 0 range fasting . 
On one occasion a three hour postprandial was 1 7 0 . 
He has had no attacks of gout or gout like arthritis in the past six weeks and is quite pleased about this . 
He has continued actively managing production and is planning a trip to Italy next month . 
His blood pressure is 1 4 0 / 7 6 right arm sitting with regular pulse of 6 8 . 
His weight is 1 7 3 ( stable ) . 
Since the cough is resolving it would seem reasonable to continue the present program . 
We will look forward to seeing the results of the prostate biopsy and we will check glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin today . 
He will return in four months for follow up . 
Orvell Oliver , M . D . 
Will check re HCTZ vs Maxide . 
If the latter , will change it . 
He is working hard as a production manager , and he will have some time off this spring .

Chest is clear to P & A . 
Abdomen is nontender . 
Sensation in feet is intact to light touch and vibration . 
He should return in 6 months . 
Orvell Oliver , M . D . 
I think it would be wise to start on a low dose of a glucose - lowering medicine , glipizide ( Glucotrol ) . 
I would start on 1 / 2 of a 5 mg pill twice a day and continue checking your blood sugar levels from time to time . 
If they stay a bit up , then increase to one whole pill ( 5 mg ) twice a day . 
Then we will see how that effects the blood sugar . 
I don ' t think this will interfere with your trip . 
Call me in a week to tell me how it is going . 
He notes that his morning fasting glucose values usually range between 1 3 0 and 1 4 0 mg percent .

This catheterization is in preparation for planned CABG by Dr . Xaysana on 4 / 2 3 / 9 6 . 
Mr . Jarvis ' s cardiac history began in 1 2 / 9 5 , when he was shoveling snow . 
At that time , he developed dizziness , diaphoresis and nausea . 
He went inside and had an episode of syncope which lasted approximately 5 minutes . 
His initial EKG showed 1 mm STE in II , III and aVF and 1 mm STE in V 5 and V 6 . 
An EKG seven minutes later showed an increase in STE in the inferior leads and STE in V 3 to V 6 with a max of 4 mm in V 3 . 
He never developed chest pain . 
An emergent cardiac catheterization at that time showed a left main with minor distal disease . 
The LAD had a proximal 8 0 % stenosis . 
The LCx had mid 4 0 % diffuse disease . 
The 1 st OM had a tandem lesion of 9 0 % . 
The RCA was large and dominant and had a proximal ulcerated 9 0 % stenosis with haziness . 
Given these findings , a 2 . 5 X 1 5 mm BMS was placed into the proximal RCA with and excellent result . 
His peak CK was 3 0 5 during that admission . 
An echo performed at that time was a technically difficult study , which showed diffuse inferior hypokinesis . 
He was discharged home in 1 2 / 9 5 in stable condition and follow - up with Dr . Xaysana in his office to discuss possible CABG . 
It was decided that the patient should have a repeat cardiac catheterization prior to the CABG to determine whether RCA restenosis is present . 
He is then scheduled to have CABG with Dr . Xaysana on 4 / 2 3 / 9 6 . 
The patient has been feeling well at home from a cardiac standpoint . 
He denies any chest pain , dyspnea , dizziness , pedal edema , orthopnea , PND , or syncope .

She has been on Zocor . 
Mitral valve disease . 
Prior to recent coronary event , she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient . 
There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus and leaflet as well as the subvalvular apparatus with an echo dense mobile structure and trigger aspect suggesting a partially disrupted chordae . 
Aspirin 3 2 5 mg p . o . 
Plavix 7 5 mg p . o . 
Hydrochlorothiazide 2 5 mg daily . 
Zocor 2 0 mg p . o . 
Lisinopril 2 0 mg p . o . 
Metformin 5 0 0 mg daily . 
Norvasc 1 0 mg daily . 
Nitroglycerin 0 . 4 mg p . r . n . 
Blood pressure 1 2 0 / 8 8 , weight 2 1 3 pounds , and temperature 9 7 . 8 . 
Chest clear to percussion and auscultation . 
Cardiac exam ; no extra sounds . 
Rather coarse near holosystolic murmur . 
No apprecialble 2 nd or third compenents . 
No pedal edema . 
She has a Q - wave in III and F and slight reversal of R - wave progression in right precordium . 
These are distinct change from EKG done one month ago . 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : 1 . 
Status post IMI . 
Not on beta - blocker and I will not initiate given sinus bradycardia . 
I have arranged for her to be seen in Cardiology to determine best next steps . 
I tried to contact the cardiologist who took care of her in Conway Hospital whose phone number is 6 7 4 - 4 4 9 - 3 3 3 8 . 
Diabetes mellitus . 
Good control . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
Will initiate therapy with Lipitor 8 0 mg p . o . 
Prior authorization form completed . 
Mitral valve disease . 
I saw her in consultation this afternoon for her diagnosis of a recent myocardial infarction . 
Please allow me to summarize her history for our records . 
Frances is a very pleasant 5 1 - year - old Danish woman who has cardiac risk factors including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and recently diagnosed glucose intolerance . 
It appears that she had been having a several - month history of anginal - type symptoms , although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia . 
On 0 4 / 0 9 / 2 0 7 6 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant , when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness , and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest . 
She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting . 
I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3 . 5 x 2 3 and 3 . 5 x 1 3 Cypher drug - eluting stents to the right coronary artery . 
Per her daughter ' s report , she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel , which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention . 
Unfortunately , we do not have details of the remainder of her coronary anatomy . 
Since her myocardial infarction , she actually has felt quite well . 
She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI . 
Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well . 
She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms . 
Her past medical history is notable for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and glucose intolerance . 
Her present medications include aspirin 3 2 5 mg a day , Plavix 7 5 mg a day , metformin 5 0 0 mg a day , simvastatin 4 0 mg a day , nitroglycerin p . r . n . , amlodipine 1 0 mg a day , hydrochlorothiazide 2 5 mg a day , and lisinopril 2 0 mg a day . 
She has no known drug allergies . 
She is presently accompanied by her daughter Landis who handles the majority of her health care . 
Landis can be reached on a cell phone at 9 4 4 - 3 5 1 - 0 9 0 4 . 
She has never used tobacco . 
Family history is notable for several aunts with myocardial infarctions and a sister whose has had a prior stroke . 
There was a significant history of glucose intolerance in the family . 
All others are negative . 
On physical examination , she is an overweight yet well - appearing female in no apparent distress . 
Her blood pressure is 1 3 1 / 8 6 and her heart rate is 6 1 beats per minute . 
Her weight is 2 1 3 pounds . 
Her neck shows 2 + carotid upstrokes . 
There is a hint of a bruit in the left carotid . 
The carotid upstrokes are full . 
Her lungs are clear to auscultation . 
The heart is normal to palpation , no thrills are palpated and the PMI is nondisplaced . 
The heart is regular in rate and rhythm and a 2 / 6 systolic ejection murmur is heard best in the right upper sternal border throughout the precordium . 
The abdomen is obese , soft , nontender with normal bowel sounds . 
Her extremities show no edema . 
Her EKG in the office today shows normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 6 1 with a normal axis and intervals . 
She has Q waves and T - wave inversions in leads III and F consistent with her recent myocardial infarction . 
I do not have a recent lipid profile on file . 
On 0 4 / 1 6 / 2 0 7 6 , she underwent an echocardiogram . 
She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg . 
She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2 . 2 m / sec . 
There are no significant wall motion abnormalities . 
She has only mild mitral regurgitation . 
In summary , well we do not have records , it is fairly clear that Mrs . Preston has had an inferior wall myocardial infarction treated with coronary stenting . 
She did receive drug - eluting stents . 
The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction . 
What is less clear , however , is the status of her other coronaries , there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time . 
From a clinical standpoint , I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time . 
She is fairly asymptomatic , and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint . 
I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point . 
To this end , I have arranged for her to undergo an adenosine PET scan to assess for residual ischemia . 
We will guide our recommendations regarding cardiac catheterization based on the results of the study . 
In terms of her lipids , it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor . 
The goal for her LDL should be in the 7 0 s and her HDLs ideally be in the 4 0 s . 
In terms of antithrombotic therapy , she did receive drug - eluting stents . 
Therefore , she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year . 
After a year , it would likely be acceptable for her to stop her Plavix for brief periods of time should it be necessary for other medical procedures . 
However , up until that time her Plavix should not be discontinued without a discussion with myself . 
She is on a very good medical regimen , although I think she would benefit from a beta - blocker . 
The hydrochlorothiazide appears to be a new medication for her , and therefore I went ahead and discontinued this and started her on extended - release metoprolol at 2 5 mg a day . 
This can certainly be cut uptitrated for better blood pressure control . 
I will call her daughter Landis with the results of her PET scan and further recommendations , and we will go ahead and make plans for her to see me again in six months . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in her care . 
If you have any further questions regarding her management , do not hesitate to contact me . 
As you know , I referred her to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of progressive worsening angina and a stress test suggesting anterior ischemia . 
We performed a catheterization on 1 2 / 1 4 / 2 0 7 6 . 
We utilized the right radial artery for access . 
We found that she developed a significant in - stent restenosis lesion within the previously placed Cypher drug - eluting stent . 
This is undoubtedly the cause of her symptoms . 
We were able to treat this lesion with balloon angioplasty and ultimately stented with a 3 . 5 x 2 4 Taxus drug - eluting stent . 
The stent was postdilated with a 4 mm noncompliant balloon to high pressure . 
The final angiographic result was excellent . 
The following morning she was doing quite well and we discharged her later in the day . 
She will remain on her usual medications and I have stressed the importance of remaining on aspirin once a day for the remainder of her life and Plavix for a minimum of a year after this procedure , though I will likely favor indefinite therapy . 
I plan on seeing her again on 0 1 / 2 4 / 2 0 7 7 in followup . 
If you have any further questions regarding her care , please do not hesitate to contact me .

Encouraged patient to eat more regularly . 
This visit lasted for 3 5 minutes , half of which was spent trying to counsel the patient to obtain proper nutrition and to go to Mental Health . 
I was unsuccessful in convincing her to attend a Mental Health session . 
Helen Whitehead , M . D . 
At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx . 
Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K + rose a bit . 
The VNA has been seeing her at home . 
According to the patient her BP has been " normal " . 
She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA . 
She denies any chest pain , shortness of breath . 
Appetite is good . 
She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K + content of many foods . 
She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2 0 9 5 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years . 
Sciatica : Dr . Solomon follows . 
No edema . 
FINDINGS : The celiac , SMA and IMA are patent . 
The solid abdominal viscera , as visualized , are unremarkable . 
Images from an ultrasound study of the kidneys and the bladder were acquired . 
There are no prior studies for comparison . 
Both kidneys are normal in size and lie . 
The right kidney measures 9 . 8 and the left kidney measures 9 . 7 cm in sagittal dimension . 
No hydronephrosis or dominant solid masses are seen . 
Notice made of a right extrarenal pelvis . 
The bladder is moderately distended without intraluminal lesions . 
IMPRESSION No hydronephrosis . 
The cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7 / 2 0 9 7 and again in early August is unclear . 
She has not been taking any NSAID including OTC forms . 
I don ' t think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her BP is reasonable off the ACEi . 
I attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion , renal function , and to advise her about the role / impact of ACEi for BP and her heart ( her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn ' t take the ACEi ) . 
I told her that it is unsafe for her to take any NSAID . 
I suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction . 
Provided her with detailed lists of low and high K + foods . 
Check lytes , renal function , Phos , Ca and Alb today . 
Will discuss Nephrology consultation with Dr Whitehead . 
She has an appt with Dr Whitehead on 8 / 2 7 . 
Length of visit was 4 5 minutes . 
Pt sustained two falls today while at home with PT / OT / VNA . 
First fall was witnessed with no head trauma or LOC . 
Second fall was unwitnessed and caused hematoma to right side of head . 
Pt does not recall falling or events immediately preceding fall ( she was using her cane ) . 
She denies dizziness , lightheadedness or aura prior to event . 
No chest pain , palpitations . 
She was able to put the hand to prevent hitting her head . 
She did not feel very fatigued afterward , there were no abnormal movements . 
She has rugs at home , but does not remember tripping . 
After falling , pt ' s next memory is of daughter taking her to her primary care doctor , where she was found ot have an elevated INR and administered 1 0 mg of PO Vitamin K . Pt denies any changes to her medications including new antibiotics , changes in Coumadin dosage , diet , or supplements . 
She denies any current alcohol or social event . 
She denies any fever , chills , diarrhea , nausea , vomit or other signs of infection . 
She takes her medications by herself and knows her Coumadin dose ( 2 . 5 ) , but is unable to mention other medications . 
She lives in an [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] , where they do not supervise her in terms of her medications , but has a VNA . 
Pt was then transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ER for further care . 
In the ER her initial VS : BP 1 3 1 / 5 3 , HR 8 3 , RR 1 8 , 9 7 . 7 . 
On physical exam she was A & OX 3 , had a hematoma in the right occiput and lower lip laceration of 0 . 5 cm . 
She had C - collar and had gross blood in the rectal vault . 
She had labs that were significant for INR of 2 0 . 2 with PTT of 7 1 . 4 , HCT of 3 7 . 7 at her baseline . 
She underwent CT scan of the head and c - spine without any abnormality and CT scan of abdomen and pelvis without acute pathology . 
Patient was T & C and received 2 units of FFP . 
Her VS were stable throughout the ER course . 
She was admitted to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring . 
GI was not called from the ER . 
Pt was recently hospitalized at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 3 - 2 8 * * ] for right facial and upper lip angioedema , as well as a recent fall . 
Pt ' s daughter reports she was confused and altered from her baseline mental status on day prior to admission . 
Angiogedema improved significantly with IV solumedrol and H 1 , H 2 blockers . 
A brain MRI was obtained due to h / o altered mental status in setting of fall , and was notable for an acute left caudate head infarct . 
MRA of the neck demonstrated a 5 0 % stenosis of the left proximal internal carotid artery and 5 0 % stenosis in both vertebral arteries in the V 2 segment . 
The TTE on [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 3 - 3 1 * * ] was negative for mural thrombus or cardiac source , but etiology of stroke felt most likely cardioembolic in setting of subtherapeutic INR . 
Pt was discharged in stable condition to rehab . 
On [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 4 - 1 2 * * ] , pt returned to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED with transient dizziness , R arm and face weakness . 
Head CT was negative for bleed , and neuro felt most her presentation was most likely due to recrudescence of prior caudate infarct in setting of mild dehydration . 
Past Medical History : - Left Caudate Head infarct - Angioedema : pruritis and periorbital and lip / tongue edema , previously intubated in MICU ( [ * * 1 2 - 1 6 * * ] ) , etiology thought to be due to lisinospril , which was subsequenlty discontinued .

Diverticulosis without diverticulitis . 
Multinodular thyroid again seen . 
Continued follow - up per thyroid ultrasound ( [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 3 - 3 1 * * ] ) recommendation . 
No definite acute fracture or dislocation . 
INR was > 2 0 and was reversed with Vitamin K and 2 units of FFP . 
Coumadin held . 
HCT was stable so decision was made not to pursue colonoscopy . 
Acute renal failure resolved with IVF . 
The patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for continued monitoring of HCT and INR . 
PROBLEM LIST : # . 
Supratherapeutic INR : Unclear exactly why INR went so high . 
Nutritional deficiency vs less efficient GI absorption of Vitamin K vs drug - drug interaction causing decreased metabolism of Coumadin . 
She was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP and on discharge her INR was 1 . 6 . 
After discussion with her primary care provider , [ * * Name 1 0 ( NameIs ) * * ] decision was made to restart coumadin at a lower dose of 1 . 5 mg daily and to have VNA check daily INR until the levels are therapeutic . 
After that , she may require INR checks twice a week until stable . 
Lower GI Bleed : No active bleeding after reversing anticoagulation . 
HCT stable Source most likely either diverticulosis or hemorrhoids bleeding in the setting of high INR . 
Atrial fibrillation : Metoprolol dose reduced because of bradycardia . 
As above , her anticoagulation was held until discharge . 
She will restart coumadin at a lower dose at 1 . 5 mg daily . 
She will need f / u regarding her HR and her BP .

DECREASE DOSE of Metoprolol to 6 . 2 5 mg twice a day ( The dose was decreased because your heart rate was too slow ) 3 . 
He has a history of chest pain and was evaluated at Klickitat Valley Hospital for the same by you and , I believe , Dr . Inglis . 
He reportedly had an echo and a treadmill test that were unconcerning . 
His episodes of chest pain are interesting . 
He feels a sharp pain for maybe a second or two in his chest followed by rapid palpitations associated with some jaw aching . 
The palpitations are of sudden onset as well as sudden offset . 
They were occurring up to one time per day through his hospitalization at Klickitat Valley a couple of weeks ago and now have occurred on two occasions since discharge . 
He is otherwise in fairly good health . 
He has four siblings , all in good health . 
He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks , Maine . 
Habits : He has never used street drugs . 
He does not smoke tobacco . 
He drinks 6 beers / alcohol per week and 2 cups of coffee per day . 
PERRLA . 
Sclerae are anicteric . 
Conjunctivae noninjected . 
Mucous membranes moist . 
No oropharyngeal lesions . 
Otherwise the tracing is within normal limits . 
Sometimes it is difficult for patients to distinguish between palpitations and chest pain per se . 
It may also be that his palpitations raise his heart rate to the point where he becomes ischemic , notwithstanding the negative stress test that he had in the past . 
We will request the records of the echo and the stress test so we can have them for our files here and I have asked him to complete a 3 0 - day event recording and follow up with me after that has been completed . 
I will certainly keep you informed about how things progress . 
At his last visit we gave him a 3 0 - day loop event recorder for arrhythmia surveillance due to palpitations . 
Since that point he has transmitted events showing rapid atrial fibrillation up to 1 6 0 Bpm associated with chest discomfort , jaw pain and chest thumping . 
These episodes occur on a random basis and last up to 4 5 minutes . 
He does not identify any precipitating factors and symptoms resolve spontaneously . 
He denies dyspnea , PND , orthopnea , lightheadedness , pre syncope or syncope . 
He reportedly has had a negative stress test and echocardiogram . 
He is not on any medications . 
He has never been on Coumadin . 
He has four siblings , all in good health . 
He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks , Maine . 
Habits : He has never used street drugs .

We have discussed the physiology of the electrical conduction system and the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation . 
We have discussed treatment options including rate control , rhythm control or pulmonary vein isolation . 
We have scheduled him for nuclear stress test to R / O ischemia given his symptoms of chest discomfort and new onset of atrial fibrillation and will send him for echocardiogram to R / O structural heart disease . 
We have had a long discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and if his diagnostic testing is within normal limits he would like to possibly consider this as an option for treatment . 
We have started him on Toprol XL 5 0 mg daily . 
If his diagnostic testing is within normal limits we will proceed initially with starting Class IC antiarrhythmic for the treatment of his atrial fibrillation . 
We will continue a discussion regarding Cryo Ablation and continue medical management . 
He has a CHAD 2 Score of 0 . 
We will therefore recommend treating with Aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily for prophylactic embolic protection and would not recommend coumadin at this time . 
We will complete diagnostic testing , follow up with the results and then proceed . 
We have encouraged him to call with any questions , concerns , or changes in health status . 
Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions in regard to his care .

As you know , he is a 5 2 - year - old male with recent history of palpitations discovered to be atrial fibrillation . 
Episodes have been associated with chest discomfort , jaw pain and chest thumping and we therefore had him complete nuclear stress test and echocardiogram to R / O structural heart disease . 
He is on Toprol XL 5 0 mg and aspirin . 
SESTA MIBI completed January 5 , 2 0 7 9 after 1 1 minutes , 1 3 METS and 9 0 MPHR was positive ischemia by ECG demonstrated by 2 mm ST depressions in leads II , AVF , and V 6 and 2 . 5 mm ST depressions in leads III and V 5 . 
Myocardial scans showed mild anteroseptal and apical ischemia with EF 6 6 % . 
He had no symptoms and there were occasional VPCs and PACs . 
Echocardiogram was normal with exception to mildly dilated LA 4 0 mm . 
Since his last visit he has had two additional of episodes of atrial fibrillation with complaint of rapid heart action , jaw pain and chest discomfort . 
The episodes lasted approximately 1 0 minutes and were relieved by rest . 
He denied lightheadedness , dizziness , pre syncope , syncope , nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis . 
Of note they occurred this time with exercise as opposed to at rest and they seemed more severe in nature . 
He has four siblings , all in good health . 
He works as an Revenue Officer for Springfield Armory Inc in Picture Rocks , Maine . 
Habits : He has never used street drugs . 
He does not smoke tobacco .

We have discussed the findings and have recommended proceeding with cardiac catheterization with potential coronary intervention . 
We have reviewed pre procedural expectations and procedural risk including femoral vascular complications , cardiac perforation , renal complications , stroke , heart attack , and death . 
He understands and has agreed to proceed . 
We have also discussed treatment options for atrial fibrillation . 
He continues to be interested in CRYO Ablation . 
We have had a long discussion in this regard . 
We will have to start medication therapy first and then proceed accordingly . 
His medication options are now limited due to ischemia . 
Sotalol is the best option at this time . 
We have spoken to Dr . Nagle who has agreed to complete his catheterization on January 2 4 , 2 0 7 9 . 
If the dye load is minimal we may decide to complete in patient Sotalol load . 
We will assess after his angiogram . 
We have completed pre procedure blood work , CXR and urinalysis . 
We have encouraged him to call with any questions , concerns or changes in health status .

Ultrasound at OSH demonstrated possible portal vein thrombosis , although this finding was not present on 1 st doppler study at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
Patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis many times during this admission . 
He was always negative for SBP . 
He was continued on cipro for SBP prophylaxis . 
Pt ' s initial U / S was unremarkable for portal vein thrombus , subsequent Abd U / S with doppler as well as CT and MRI , notable for Portal vein thrombus . 
Anticoagulation was contraindicated given his thrombocytopenia , pt also developed some oozing around temporary central lines . 
His clot then extended into SVC and was no longer a candidate for transplant surgery . 
Further transplant work up stopped and pt was made DNR / DNI given no further options for treatment . 
Patient was started on octreotide , midodrine , and albumin at the OSH . 
Patient ' s SBP dropped during HD from base line BP of 9 0 ' s to low 8 0 ' s . 
He was then transferred to the ICU for CVVH . 
He tolerated several sessions of HD . 
Plan for continued HD as outpatient as pt would like to continue HD . 
Plan was to provide HD as outpatient close to home . 
The patient was admitted to the MICU for ongoing CVVHD given his pressures were prohibitive for traditional HD . 
The patient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide for possible hepatorenal syndrome and was additionally treated with IV albumin , which was discontinued on [ * * 2 1 5 0 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Midodrine was increased to 1 2 . 5 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
The patient ' s pressures tolerated CVVHD well and his creatinine decreased from 5 . 9 to 2 . 5 . 
He has required dialysis , though , since being transferred from the MICU to the floor , and his renal function has not improved . 
Unfortunately , given his coagulopathy , he has had issues with bleeding from the dialysis catheter site following dialysis . 
He did not bleed following his last course of hemodialysis and was deemed safe to go home . 
Labs showed picture consistent with DIC but this could also be from underlying liver disease . 
He received FFP / Cryo before procedures . 
He recieved several units of PRBC for low HCT but remained stable . 
Had some bleeding from tunneled line .

She says there was initially some redness , no warmth in these joints . 
She could not open or close her hands . 
She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands , wrists , elbows , shoulders and knees . 
She noticed swelling in her R knee , no swelling or redness in other joints . 
Her muscles are diffusely tender . 
She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia , although not as severe . 
She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2 1 2 8 while taking rifampin / cipro / azithro for MAC . 
These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped . 
She denies recent fevers or chills . 
She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago .

She was admitted to Internal Medicine for further evaluation . 
She reports decreased pain with Demerol , interval improvement in hand joint swelling / erythema / stiffness . 
The constellation of myalgias , arthralgias / synovitis , ? pleurisy , Raynaud ' s , GERD , HTN and + FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma . 
Rarely , a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations ( systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma ) . 
The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c / w possible crystal disease . 
The bilateral hand distribution is typical , but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not . 
Postviral arthralgias / myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process . 
Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia . 
We will follow with you . 
She has had multiple episodes similar to this throughout her life with her first pneumonia apparently occurring when she was 3 years old . 
Her most recent episode peaked 3 weeks ago with a violent cough , sore throat , and ear pain . 
She was sputum culture positive for moraxella and started on a 1 9 day course of Ketek ( Telithromycin ) with some resolution of symptoms over the first 8 days .

I have encouraged frequent ambulation . 
She will continue to use her home flutter valve . 
Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house . 
We will continue her home Inderal at 2 4 0 mg qd . 
This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary . 
The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough . 
She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy . 
Her admission BP of 1 8 7 / 9 7 was in the setting of a delay in today ' s dose of inderal . 
She was asymptomatic with this high pressure . 
We will continue her hormone replacement , GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline . 
She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis . 
HPI : Pt at baseline occasionally gets SOB from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest PT recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without SOB . 
She has no known cardiac hx but does have HTN and + fam hx of early CAD . 
Pt awoke this morning in her USOH but quickly had sudden onset of 1 0 / 1 0 sharp SSCP radiating to her right arm associated w / right arm numbness . 
Pain is slightly better w / sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality . 
She then had a vasovagal attack , which she has had before in the setting of pain , and she started to feel lightheaded , nauseated , and diaphoretic . 
She laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little . 
Her husband gave her Excedrin w / o improvement and called 9 1 1 . 
EMS gave her 3 puffs of NTG and 4 baby ASA w / o effect . 
The ambulance brought her to the closest hospital , Colorow . 
In the ED , she was found to be hypertensive w / SBP 1 8 0 s , for which she was started on TNG gtt . 
She also underwent PE CT which per report was neg for PE but showed bilat DVTs , and she was started on heparin . 
She was given fioricet , zofran , and fentanyl for her CP w / relief . 
She was then given a dose of IV lopressor and also had one episode of N / V . 
Her labs were significant for + cardiac markers : 1 st set w / CK / MB / index 3 9 / 0 . 9 / 2 . 3 , trop I 0 . 0 3 , 2 nd 4 4 3 / 5 7 . 3 / 1 2 . 9 , trop 2 . 2 2 , 3 rd set 6 8 6 / 8 7 . 3 / 1 2 . 7 , trop 4 . 1 8 .

No pulmonary embolism . 
Marked cardiomegaly , with evidence of prior myocardial infarction in the left ventricular apex , with likely areas of scarring , and aneurysm formation at the apex . 
Evaluation is limited on this non - gated study , but a dedicated cardiac CT could be performed if clinically indicated to further evaluate this region . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . 
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis . 
Pulmonary artery enlargement , concerning for pulmonary arterial hypertension . 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal . 
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed ( LVEF = 2 0 % ) secondary to muliple areas of severe hypokinesis and akinesis ( see figure ) , with posterobasal dyskinesis . 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 1 8 mmHg ) . 
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III / IV ( severe ) LV diastolic dysfunction . 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal . 
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level .

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
Moderate to severe [ 3 + ] tricuspid regurgitation is seen . 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is no pericardial effusion . 
Compared with the findings of the prior report ( images unavailable for review ) of [ * * 2 1 5 5 - 3 - 1 7 * * ] , the tricuspid regurgitation is probably increased .

CC chest wall pain with EKG changes at interventional radiology . 
She is an 8 1 yo woman with a h / o diverticulitis and diverticular abcess treated with a percutaneous drain and has developed a colocutaneous fistula . 
She is at the McDonough County Rehabilitation . 
She had her drain in the LLQ changed 7 days ago and devoloped some leaking from the drain in the past couple of days . 
She was scheduled to come in to the Radiology department to change the drain . 
She developed chest pain in the IR suite associated with increased BP and HR to 1 3 0 with deep ST changes in the anterolateral and inferior changes and new RBBB . 
The chest pain was relieved with SL NTG and was taken to ER for eval . 
Since being in the ER , her symptoms have abated and EKG changes have improved to baseline . 
Troponin / CPK are negative at baseline . 
It is not clear if she received her medications from MC nursing home this AM It is likely that she has demand ischemia . 
Would plan to cycle trop / cpk and resume medical managment . 
Dr . Reyes covering this weekend . 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Notable for the above , plus ischemic colitis . 
JVP 4 cm supine . 
Cardiac : Regular rate and rhythm , S 1 - S 2 . 
There is a 2 / 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border . 
Pulses were 2 + and symmetric . 
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia . 
Chest x - ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia . 
Chest pain : The patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers . 
Adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects . 
Gastrointestinal : Her esophageal spasms and GERD will be treated with PPI . 
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Prilosec 2 0 mg p . o . 
DISPOSITION : The patient will be transferred back to the McDonough County Rehabilitation Center . 
YONATHAN OLIVER TURK , M . D . 
He has managed to lose 3 lbs . 
His cough is virtually gone and now has only rare cough with a little bit of phlegm , grading it as 2 out of 1 0 vs . 8 - 9 out of 1 0 , to which his wife agrees . 
They both attribute it to the Prilosec . 
He now sleeps well and does not use his wedge . 
He has no snoring , daytime hypersomnolence , or morning headaches - no longer falls asleep at work . 
Allergies and nasal congestion are not evident . 
No lower extremity edema , swollen glands , or fevers . 
Mildly less prominent exertional breathlessness - He now occasionally has to go up one flight of stairs without stopping . 
On examination , he is well appearing . 
Respiratory rate 2 2 and unlabored . 
Blood pressure 9 0 / 5 0 with a small cuff . 
Conjunctivae are clear . 
Oropharynx is clear . 
Trachea is midline , no goiter or adenopathy . 
JVP is 7 cm with borderline HJR . 
Abdomen : Soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly or mass . 
My review of CT scan of the chest shows faint peripheral subpleural reticular pattern with cyst formation and no significant nodules . 
Interstitial lung disease - Mild objective impairment by functional status . 
Pulmonary function tests - Overall , these were stable , and the CT scan is quite suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis . 
However , as I reviewed with the patient and his wife , it is well established that 1 0 % of the time , another disorder , such as occult hypersensitivity pneumonitis or nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis can be found on lung biopsy . 
There is no evidence of a rheumatologic disorder nor any evidence of chronic aspiration , other than that associated with GE reflux , to explain his lung disease . 
He would be a very reasonable candidate for gamma interferon , although this likely would necessitate low - dose steroids - the latter treatment would certainly have an impact on his diabetes . 
GE reflux - This is the main source of his cough and is well established to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis . 
If he is able to lose weight and change his lifestyle , he can have very good control of this . 
Possible mild pulmonary hypertension related to the pulmonary fibrosis . 
Possible sleep disorder - Currently is entirely without symptoms , now that his reflux is well controlled . 
Chronic cough . 
Diabetes - Better controlled . 
Obesity - He continues to need aggressive weight loss program . 
As I mentioned to him , he would not be a candidate for lung transplantation evaluation while he is at such as weight , but he is starting to make some progress . 
Continue proton pump inhibitor at b . i . d . 
Referral to Dr . Harry Yerger for VATS lung biopsy . 
Cardiovascular evaluation by you , prior to his surgery , would be appreciated . 
It has been a pleasure to participate in his care . 
Please feel free to call with any questions or comments . 
VATS biopsy on 9 / 2 7 showed usual interstitial pneumonitis with extensive smooth muscle metaplasia - a rather unusual reading . 
Since the biopsy , he has recovered well , but is mildly more short of breath than previous . 
For example , he notes that going up the four stairs to the house with bundles he is mildly short of breath and has to rest . 
The cough is slightly increased to 3 / 1 0 , but is markedly better than on presentation . 
He has no leg edema , chest pain , skin rash , joint problems , or fevers . 
He has managed to lose 6 lbs . 
GE reflux is very well controlled . 
Blood pressure 1 1 0 / 6 0 , respiratory rate 2 0 and unlabored . 
Oropharynx is clear . 
Conjunctivae are clear . 
Trachea is midline , no goiter . 
Pulmonary function tests today by my review show an FEV 1 and FVC that are decreased by approximately 1 0 % , total lung capacity decreased by 1 liter , and DLCO down from 2 0 to 1 4 . 
Weight is 2 3 8 lbs . 
Biopsy - proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - The biopsy reading is somewhat unusual , and I will review this at our Pulmonary group weekly meeting , particularly with an eye to agents that might possibly target to exclude muscle metaplasia . 
I continue to think him a relatively high risk candidate for the low - benefit regiment of prednisone , with an immunosuppressant agent . 
I think he may be a very good candidate for gamma - interferon , but unfortunately not every one benefits from this . 
I emphasized strongly to he and his wife that his disease may have progressed , or could be made worse by the recent chest surgery and worsened gastroesophageal reflux . 
If the disease was , indeed , progressing , we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup . 
The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity . 
I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 1 9 0 lbs . 
Hence , he has his work cut out for him . 
Obesity - As above . 
Diabetes . 
Possible coronary artery disease - He apparently did fine on his preoperative cardiac workup . 
GE reflux - As mentioned . 
Cough - Mainly due to GE reflux , and less prominent contribution from the pulmonary fibrosis . 
Add Reglan 1 0 mg b . i . d . 
Continue Prilosec 4 0 mg b . i . d . 
We will review pathology . 
Follow - up visit with full pulmonary function tests in one month . 
I strongly urged him to continue a steady , but progressive weight loss program - I expect that his life will depend upon it . 
It has been a pleasure to participate in his care . 
Please feel free to call with any comments or questions . 
He as treated with high dose Solumedrol and with antibiotics , and is improving nicely . 
He is extubated and has begun to eat . 
Diabetes was diagnosed 1 4 years ago . 
He was treated with pioglitazone 4 5 mg qd , metformin 2 0 0 0 mg in divided doses and a sulfonylurea until February of this year , when the sulfonylurea was replaced with insulin . 
His hemoglobin A 1 c was 7 . 4 % a month ago .

Full EOM ' s . 
No gallops . 
No masses . 
No tenderness . 
No palpable AAA . 
DP 2 + R , absent L . PT 2 + , = . 
Good foot care . 
I have no objection to resuming his pioglitazone , or substituting rosiglitazone while he is here , as long as you do not feel that volume overload is playing any role in his deterioration . 
I would prefer not to resume the metformin while is at risk for acute respiratory deterioration with risk of acidosis . 
Would change the steroid dosing to 8 AM , 8 PM , hoping that we can also start to reduce the doses , PM first , if possible . 
He appears to have an anemia that has at least a component of iron deficiency . 
If you agree , would start iron repletion . 
Thanks . 
He was admitted to the BCC from 1 / 8 / 9 4 to 3 / 1 5 / 9 4 with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and admission to the medical ICU . 
During that admission he was listed for lung transplantation . 
He was discharged to a rehab facility and then to home two days ago . 
He returns now for single lung transplant from a deceased donor . 
Speaks a few words at a time . 
Here with his family .

Mr . Horn was most recently admitted from 1 2 / 1 1 / 9 4 through 1 2 / 3 0 / 9 4 for complaints of severe fatigue and dyspnea , although without symptoms of infection or acute graft rejection . 
His main complaint was generalized weakness and fatiguability even w / very minimal activity . 
Additionally , he reported a very poor appetite and continued weight loss . 
During that admission , he was transfused to a Hct & gt ; 3 0 and his PFTs ultimately returned back to baseline . 
His weakness was felt to be primarily related to his malnutrition as he was documented as having an inadequate caloric intake . 
Nutrition was consulted , a PEG tube was placed and tube feeds were started to supplement his nutrition . 
He was discharged without incident on 1 2 / 3 0 . 
The patient continued w / Nepro boluses and nocturnal TF at home and demonstrated an 8 lb weight gain in less than 2 months . 
He was improving until blood work revealed a positive CMV antigenemia ( 7 cells ) on 1 / 2 9 / 9 5 . 
Transplant ID was consulted and the patient was restarted on Valcyte 4 5 0 QOD , and then later bumped up to QD dosing based on ID recommendations . 
He again experienced myelosuppression and was started on neupogen 3 0 0 mcg sc qd on 2 / 1 4 / 9 5 for a WBC of 0 . 6 . 
At that time is HCT was 2 4 . 8 and PLTs 3 2 K . 
A repeat CBC was obtained today and revealed worsening myelosuppression ; Hct 2 1 . 6 / Hgb 6 . 9 , WBC 0 . 4 and PLTs 1 5 K . 
Case was discussed with Dr . Valerio and the patient was contacted and instructed to present to the BCC ER for further evaluation and treatment .

At home he became febrile ( 2 4 hr nursing care ) w / to 1 0 3 . 4 . 
His nurse called Dr . [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] ( ID ) on [ * * 8 - 2 3 * * ] who was notified that he developed fever to 1 0 1 but subsequently deferveced . 
He was instructed to call back if recurrent fever . 
Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] was called back later that his temp was 1 0 3 and she instructed him to go to the ED . 
He also had + fatigue . 
He had decreased activity and appetite . 
He was recently admit to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] 2 weeks ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 8 4 0 3 * * ] ) ago for fever - work up for etiology neg .

CXR was negative for pneumonia . 
All blood cultures were negative to date , including cultures for yeast , mycolytic infections and for M . furfur . 
Urine culture was negative . 
TEE was negative for endocarditis . 
CT of the cspine and bone scan were negative for osteomyelitis . 
MRI showed subtle signal changes which may suggest chronic osteomyelitis but no prior MRI was available for comparision ( last one was in [ * * 2 1 9 3 * * ] , when he did not have osteo ) . His Hickman was felt to be free of infection , so it was not pulled . 
He denies any headache , neck pain , CP , chills , lightheadedness , headache , cough / sputum production , or change in bowel or urinary habits ( burning , frequency , etc . ) . 
He also has noticed no erythema , tenderness , or swelling around his Hickman line ( last changed [ * * 2 1 9 6 - 7 - 2 1 * * ] ) , though he notes that his previous line infections have also been without external / visible changes . 
He has no sick contacts or recent travel . 
In the ED , he had bld cultures sent . 
Vanco and zosyn was given ( pt was already on vanco qod ) . 
ID was notified . 
CXR no evidence no focal infiltrate or change from prior CXR . 
BP 7 0 s / 4 0 s . 
BP improved to 8 0 - 9 0 s / 4 0 s . He did not have any signs of distress and was mentating within his normal range Small rim of erythema around Hickman , but obvious pus . 
Stoma was WNL . 
He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring for hypotension .

Microbiology : TPN fungal culture : pending Blood cultures : pending Urine culture : negative Fungal blood cultures : pending Stool c diff negative x 1 . 
RUQ U / S : FINDINGS : The patient is status post cholecystectomy . 
There is no intra - or extra - hepatic biliary ductal dilatation . 
The common duct measures 6 mm in diameter , which is not significantly changed , allowing for differences in technique . 
The main portal vein shows appropriate hepatopetal flow . 
No focal liver lesions are identified , and the echotexture of the liver appears normal . 
IMPRESSION : No evidence of biliary obstruction . 
FRONTAL CHEST : Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable , with mild cardiomegaly . 
No focal consolidations are identified within the lungs . 
No evidence of pleural effusion . 
Multiple right - sided rib fractures again seen . 
Right - sided central venous line with tip overlying the distal SVC . 
Cervical fusion hardware again noted . 
IMPRESSION : No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or significant change from prior study . 
Brief Hospital Course : Fever : Blood culture and urine cultures were sent . 
CXR on admission did not show focal infiltrate . 
He was started on vanco ( increased from chronic qod to qd ) and zosyn ( per discussion w / ID ) . 
His recent hosp admission record [ * * 7 - 2 6 * * ] was reviewed and showed extensive infectious workup which was unrevealing ( including MRI c - spine , which revealed no significant new changes ; neg bone scan ; negative blood cultures ; negative TEE ) . 
GI and ID were concerned that his line ( hickman placed in [ * * 7 - 2 5 * * ] ) was the source of his fever . 
He has never had anything cultured from the line and his cultures are again negative , though his chronic vancomycin may be suppressing the organism . 
ID recommended his home TPN be cultured ( including M furfur ) . 
Given negative cultures , the zosyn was discontinued and his vancomycin was returned to [ * * Location * * ] dosing . 
The patient remained afebrile x 2 4 hours and was thus discharged home with instructions to continue checking his temperature at least 2 times per day . 
Hypotension - Pt was initially hypotensive to SBP 7 0 s in the ED . 
He responded quickly to a number of 5 0 0 cc IVF boluses over the initial 4 8 hrs . 
His BP meds were initially held . 
Hyperbilirubinemia / Elevated ALk Phos - His alk phos and bili were elevated on admission ( rest of his LFTs was relatively stable ) . 
He did not complain of pain . 
RUQ u / s recommended by GI was unremarkable . 
His hct slowly drifted down to low 3 0 s on admission . 
Hemolysis labs were sent but were normal . 
Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease . 
Folate and B 1 2 were normal . 
Nutrition - Pt was initially given standard TPN as his home formula was not available . 
Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 7 9 * * ] ( pt ' s own GI specialist ) came by on [ * * 8 - 2 5 * * ] and gave specific instruction on the non - standard TPN formulation .

MS nl , CN II through XII intact . 
Motor 5 / 5 UE and LE . 
Sensory intact to LT and symm all 4 extrem . 
Pt has been undergoing treament for persistent UTI . 
While sob is likely multifactorial from CHF and COPD , COPD exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology . 
CHF is argued against by : normal BNP ( especially in comparison to elevated BNP in 6 0 0 0 s on prior admission for CHF ) , clear CXR , clear lung exam , and pt is still having exertional CP similar to what she felt on AM of admission . 
If one believes her EKGs demonstrated ischemic changes , this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent . 
However , ST changes appear minimal on close evaluation of EKG changes . 
Cardiac enzymes are negative so far . 
Negative so far . 
Does not appear to be volume overloaded . 
EKG changes are real and indicative of significant ischemic disease . 
At current level of dyspnea , pt would not be able to do a treadmill test .

She also received Lasix on admission . 
She was switched to po prednisone for COPD exacerbation . 
EP was consulted for changing EKG with new TWI in II , III , AVF , which was thought to be T wave memory from pacer placement .

She was transferred to the medicine floor for further management . 
She never produced a sputum culture . 
She remained afebrile without leukocytosis .

However , the patient was found to have rising liver function tests with a peak total bilirubin level of 4 . 5 and , therefore , underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure on this date . 
This study demonstrated diffuse dilatation at the proximal site of the biliary anastomosis , compatible with an anastomotic stricture . 
A 5 cm by # 1 0 French plastic biliary stent was , therefore , placed . 
Following this procedure , the patient felt well clinically without abdominal pain . 
However , his amylase and lipase were slightly elevated the day following the procedure and he was , therefore , monitored for possible post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis . 
The patient was maintained on his intravenous diuretics and his liver function tests slowly returned to [ * * Location 1 8 6 7 * * ] following the procedure . 
However , on hospital day number 1 3 , the patient complained of left upper extremity swelling , which he states had been there for some months prior to admission . 
However , given the presence of a left subclavian central venous line , and this new finding on examination , a duplex ultrasound was ordered for the left upper extremity which was consistent with a deep venous thrombosis . 
The patient was , therefore , started on a heparin drip to be titrated to a goal PTT between 4 0 to 6 0 seconds . 
He was also started on Coumadin 5 mg daily towards a goal INR of 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 . 
At this time , the patient was progressing well with physical therapy and was discharged to the [ * * Hospital 1 7 3 0 0 * * ] Rehabilitation Center on hospital day number 1 6 , on a heparin drip , along with intravenous Lasix and Coumadin . 
His central venous line was removed prior to discharge . 
His heparin drip may be discontinued once his INR reaches a level of 2 . 0 . 
He should be treated for Coumadin for three months given his left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis . 
He will maintain his Lasix dose at 8 0 mg intravenous twice a day until his follow - up appointment on [ * * 2 1 4 8 - 4 - 1 8 * * ] . 
He is to have his laboratory studies drawn twice weekly , on Monday and Thursday , and faxed to the transplant center for adjustment of his Cyclosporin dosing . 
This level is to be drawn two hours after his morning dose . 
The patient was instructed to call the transplant center if he had any other questions or concerns . 
Patient appears to be doing fine . 
Treatment recommendations from the Spinal Clinic will be forthcoming . 
Patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months . 
She continues to do well and had an LDL of 9 0 in March . 
We will recheck it again today . 
She has no significant chest discomfort and is doing all of her activities . 
She has no syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea . 
She is tolerating her medications quite well and is happy with her progress . 
Current medications are one aspirin per day as well as Isordil 2 0 mg . 
She has not used sublingual Nitroglycerin although she has this . 
Her blood pressure today is 1 2 8 / 8 0 and her heart rate is 5 0 and regular . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam reveals a II / VI left sternal border systolic ejection murmur . 
Abdomen is soft and nontender . 
Extremities are free of edema . 
Ms . Kelli Westyn - Nuel is doing well . 
We will check her LDL again today to make sure it did not rebound to a higher level following her myocardial infarction . 
We will also check her liver function test because of her statin therapy . 
We may in the future need to adjust her nitrates to a more rational once per day regimen , but her current situation is so stable that we will leave her medications as is . 
Spencer O . Wilhelm , M . D . 
Approximately at 1 1 am , patient developed severe nausea and she vomited x 3 . 
She was started on IV fluids and her discharge was put on hold . 
The patient was stable , afebrile with vital signs within normal limits . 
Approximately at 3 pm , patient was found to have rigors , her vital signs revealed hypotension with SBP to the 7 0 s , and hyperglycemia with FS 4 7 0 s and altered mental status . 
The patient received IV fluid bolus ( 2 L LR ) , SC insulin and was transferred to ICU for further management . 
Her blood revealed increased leukocytosis , hyponatremia , hyperkalemia and Cre 1 . 7 ( 0 . 4 - 0 . 6 baseline ) . 
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics , levophed gtt to maintain BP and agressive fluid resuscitation , NGT was placed . 
Abdominal CT scan revealed LLL consolidations , persistent 2 . 9 x 1 . 3 cm rim enhancing aortocaval fluid collection near the liver hilum and was grossly stable compare with CT from [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] . 
With interventions patient continue to improve . 
Her BP stabalized and pressors were weaned off , hyperglycemia improved with insulin , Cre started to downward with fluids . 
WBC started to downward 2 6 - > 1 9 . 8 - > 1 2 . 6 with abx treatment . 
Her blood , urine and stool samples were sent for culture . 
Patient received 2 units of pRBC and HCT improved ( 2 4 - > 3 0 . 2 ) , and her mental status returned to her baseline . 
The patient returned to the floor on [ * * 2 1 2 9 - 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] . 
Her urine and stool cultures were negative , last blood cultures still pendind . 
Patient ' s Cre returned back to normal , her Bactrim and Fluconazole were restarted . 
The patient ' s Coumadin was hold since [ * * 2 1 2 9 - 1 2 - 2 3 * * ] for INR 4 . 4 . 
The patient still to have supratherapeutic INR on discharge ( 3 . 6 ) , her INR will be followed daily by VNA and her Coumadin will be restarted when INR therapeutic ( [ * * 3 - 1 7 * * ] ) . 
Patient ' s PCP will be notify by VNA about INR level and he will adjust patient ' s daily Warfarin base on INR result . 
At the time of discharge , the patient was doing well , afebrile with stable vital signs . 
The patient was tolerating a regular diet , ambulating , voiding without assistance , and pain was well controlled . 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow - up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan . 
He has a hx of prostate CA diagnosed in 2 0 5 9 at the BNH and had an RRP shortly thereafter at the BNH . 
Apparently his pathology showed extraprostatic extension and he received postop XRT . 
Apparently , he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3 . 5 3 . 
He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this , admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments . 
The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan , all of which were negative . 
He has the reports here with him . 
The bone scan does show an abnormality at L 5 , but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion . 
He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis . 
This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him . 
He states that he is scheduled to have a cystoscopy at the BNH next week , however , is unsure if he has had a urine cytology done . 
Impression : In reviewing the patient ' s limited records that he brings and his history , it appears that he has had the appropriate care at the BNH . 
I have reassured him of this , and have indicated that he should just make sure that a urine cytology is also checked and that a repeat PSA be performed in the near future . 
I also informed him that he will likely need anti - androgen therapy in the future for further treatment of his prostate CA . 
He may follow up with me if he has questions in the future . 
He underwent radical prostatectomy in 2 0 6 1 and salvage XRT in 2 0 6 2 . 
His care was at BNH and we don ' t have his XRT records . 
The patient recalls 3 7 treatments . 
The patient was well until he had an elevated PSA of 3 . 5 2 in 1 0 / 7 5 . 
He underwent a bone scan in 1 1 / 7 5 showing worrisome uptake at L 5 . 
In 1 / 7 6 he had a PSA of 1 7 . 4 6 . 
He has also developed lower back pain requiring MS Contin for pain control . 
His course was complicated by a possible bladder / urethral infection . 
He is incontinent from his surgery . 
In 2 / 7 6 he had a cystoscopy which revealed nodules in the bladder ( TCC vs . prostatic scar / inflammation ) . 
The patient ' s LLP worsened . 
He reports occasional severe shooting pain that lead to gait imbalance . 
On the day of presentation , he experienced severe acute back pain while getting out of bed . 
The pain was so intolerable that he asked his daughter to bring him to the emergency room . 
ENT was consulted in the ED and determined that he had a limited glottic gap , and that the acute stridor was most likely secondary to anxiety and increased air flow through a restricted glottic opening , recommending humidified air by shovel air mask , steroids , and outpatient followup . 
MRI of the lumbar spine showed metastatic disease involving of the L 4 vertebral body , extending into the pedicles , both L 4 - 5 neural foramina , and the prevertebral soft tissues . 
No compression of the thecal sac . 
Mr . Quin reports improved pain since admission . 
He still has some pain when moving from one position to anther . 
He would like to be cared at the LMH from now on . 
The patient had an oncologist from BNH but does not remember his name . 
CPA and lives with wife in Tonganoxie . 
HEENT : PERRL . 
EOMI . 
Oropharynx is clear . 
Cardiac : S 1 , S 2 , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . 
Chest : Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
Abdomen : Soft , nontender , nondistended , with positive bowel sounds . 
No bony pain to palpation . 
The patient ' s LBP is likely due to his spine met . 
Based on the MRI results , his symptoms and his exam we believe he is an appropriate candidate for palliative radiotherapy to his L - spine . 
I discussed with Mr . Quin the likely cause of his pain . 
We then discussed the treatment options . 
Mr . Quin would like to undergo a course of palliative radiotherapy to relieve his pain . 
We will simulate ( plan ) the patient ' s XRT tomorrow am , with a treatment to follow on the same day . 
All of the patient ' s questions were answered to his satisfaction . 
We would also recommend an GU oncology consultation regarding the patient ' s ADT and other possible systemic therapies . 
The patient only had L - spine MRI , a bone scan may be of benefit to establish the extent of metastatic disease . 
Last PSA was 1 . 7 . 
Is receiving Lupron every 3 months ( after his 6 weeks pf Casodex ) . 
Radical retropubic prostatectomy was performed in the BNH system , and disease extended beyond the prostate to the margins of the resection and into the seminal vesicle . 
In early 2 0 6 2 he received adjuvant radiation . 
His PSA remained undetectable throughout the 2 0 6 0 s , but was troubled by a great deal of radiation cystitis with hematuria , frequency , and dysuria . 
In addition , he was totally incontinent . 
In 2 0 7 1 his PSA was undetectably low . 
Over the last 8 months , he has developed low back pain of progressively increasing severity . 
His PSA back in September 2 0 7 5 was approximately 3 and when checked in November was 1 7 . 
Early this year his pain was of great severity , and repeat CT scans and bone scans were performed . 
Destructive disease was seen in the body of L 4 with foraminal encroachment . 
The thecal sac and the cauda quina were , however , intact . 
He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection , but his pain became more and more severe , and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him . 
Since admission he was started on urgent radiotherapy and has completed 1 2 cycles of radation with a last PSA of 1 . 7 . 
He is due for Lupron injection on 6 / 1 3 / 7 6 at which time a PSA will be checked . 
His oncologist Dr . Leblanc has helped him wean the MS Contin and tried to start adding low dose gabapentin as a narcotic sparing agent for presumed neuropathic pain . 
He is not requiring his prn pain meds very often . 
He has claudication . 
He has symmetric leg edema worse right after lupron injection and improved with TEDS . 
No chest symptoms .

He is on glyburide 1 0 am 5 pm . 
He had his eyes checked by an opthalmologist recently and no evidence of retinopathy was present . 
He has no early satiety , blurry vision , polyuria polydipsia , foot ulcers , chest pain , shorteness of breath , but does have some claudication . 
He is not on an ACE - inhibitor , takes HCTZ for BP control and has had hematuria from aspirin . 
Otherwise negative in detail . 
Skin : No rashes .

Abdomen : + BS . 
Soft , ND / NT . 
No HSM . 
Back : No spinous process tenderness or CVAT . 
Ext : No cyanosis , clubbing but has mild bilateral ankle edema . 
Pain - I think he has a component of neuropathic pain . 
I think that we will start low dose neuronitni 1 0 0 tid for 7 days , he will email me about how his pain is and we will cut his pm MScontin in half if we can . 
I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing . 
His PSA is low and will continue to follow . 
Cluadication - check PVRs , most likely has bilateral iliofemoral disease . 
He does not want to take aspirin given hiematuria in the past . 
DM - will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary , . 
He needs U / a for microalb , eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house , will check PVrs , will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton . 
Will check lipids . 
Will continue to monitor BP . 
Will start aspirin when he is willing . 
As part of a work - up for his prostate cancer , stress test was performed on 6 / 3 0 / 7 6 .

EF was 5 0 % . 
The patient denies any cardiac symptoms such as chest discomfort , SOB , palpitations , or dizziness . 
He lives with his wife . 
He quit smoking in 1 / 7 6 . 
Carotid upstroke was normal . 
DP not palpable . 
Distal capillary filling - good . 
Mild non - specific STT wave changes . 
Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI . 
Since he is asymptomatic , I would continue medical therapy . 
For some reason , he has not started Lipitor . 
His LDL is markedly elevated . 
My target LDL would be below 7 0 . 
For his myocardial protection , I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 2 5 mg . qd to 5 0 mg . qd . 
He has a severely dysfunctional bladder and severe urethral stricture 2 / 2 radiation therapy for prostate CA . 
He has been dependent on a SP tube for bladder drainage , however , after the past 2 SP tube changes , he has developed urosepsis . 
He now presents again in urosepsis after his most recent SP tube change . 
He also complains of bilateral pelvic / hip pain which is limiting his ability to walk without a walker . 
This is a marked change over the past 3 months . 
He has decreased pulses in his DPs bilaterally and has a h / o smoking and diabetes . 
Conversant . 
Normal gait . 
Normal syntax . 
Urosepsis - Treat as you are with Levofloxacin . 
Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem , I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen / pelvis to r / o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE . 
Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr . Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit . 
He understands this and is still considering this .

These findings are indicative of potential bioccipital epileptogenic foci with underlying subcortical dysfunction . 
In addition , background showed diffuse slowing suggestive of a mild encephalopathy of non - specific etiology . 
A nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach . 
Low lung volumes . 
Retrocardiac opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm . 
Right lung base opacity is also noted . 
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax . 
Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable . 
Heart size is normal . 
There is no pulmonary edema . 
Partially imaged upper abdomen is notable for air - filled prominent stomach and bowel loops . 
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present . 
Note is made of a slower than average cardiac rate . 
Diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with cystic myelomalacia at C 4 - 5 at the site of prior contusion . 
No abnormal enhancement is seen . 
Post - surgical changes from anterior cervical fusion and instrumentation at C 3 - C 5 levels and C 3 - C 6 laminectomies . 
Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine , most prominent at C 4 - C 5 and C 5 - C 6 as described above . 
Brief Hospital Course : 4 6 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury , s / p C 3 - 6 ACDF and remaining quadriplegia , indwelling suprapubic catheter / recurrent UTIs , baclofen pump , COPD , OSA who presented to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with subsequent unresponsiveness , s / p 1 day intubation . 
Admission complicated by hypotension , bradycardia , hypoventillation . 
Hypotension was not responsive to extensive volume challenge ( given 7 . 5 L NS in 2 4 hours ) . 
The etiology appears to be a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect . 
The HR and BP responded to atropine challenge , indicating increased vagal tone from some offending process . 
Started on scopalomine patch . 
He was later also started on midodrine for further pressure support . 
The etiology of the increased vagal tone was most likely related to the UTI . 
The other major factors contributing was probably excess benzodiazepine and opioid . 
He had pinpoint pupils when he first came in . 
On his home doses of medications the patient had a low respiratory rate , and retained CO 2 on ABG . 
The chronic hypopnea may lead to increased bradycardia . 
The patient ' s diazepam and methadone doses were decreased as below . 
He never had a fever , but he may have been unable to mount fever due to level of spinal cord lesion . 
Patient was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics but was narrowed based upon OSH culture data . 
Following 4 days of IV antibiotics , the patient was narrowed to PO amoxicillin for enterococcus plus cipro for serratia . 
Will receive a total of 1 4 days of abx for complicated UTI . 
Last dose of Abx to be given on [ * * 2 1 3 6 - 5 - 3 1 * * ] . 
The patient was admitted following sustained altered mental status after an episode of clonic movements , thought by wife to represent seizure activity . 
Resolved per wife on admission to the ICU , but patient continued to be sedated with flat affect . 
Now much improved once decreased opiates , likely medication effect , as well as encephalopathy related to the UTI . 
Methadone dose was decreased . 
Diazepam dose was decreased . 
EEG was negative for seizure activity . 
Unclear if patient actually had seizure leading up to original presentation but no evidence during this hospitalization . 
More likely patient had toxic / metabolic derangements described above . 
Of note , the patient ' s wife was very concerned that the movements she saw ( eyes rolling back in head , patient becoming confused ) had happened a previous time when the patient received cymbalta . 
Cymbalta was stopped . 
Syringx : Patient had been recently diagnosed with cervical syringx per OSH records . 
However repeat MRI here did not show syringx but did show diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with cystic myelomalacia at C 4 - 5 at the site of prior contusion . 
This was conveyed to one of the patient ' s primary neurologists , Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 2 7 5 9 8 * * ] . 
On albuterol at home . 
Chronically retaining CO 2 .

Current recommendations are that patients with IVF filters be anticoagulated if there are no contraindications ( since IVC thrombi can develop ) . 
Given absence of contraindications , the patient ' s coumadin was continued . 
Patient remained with controlled pain on decreased methadone to 1 0 mg qid . 
Patient also started on lidocaine patch .

Would try to continue antiplatelet therapy for a minimum of 3 0 days , and preferably for 9 0 days in the setting of recently placed bare metal stents , if tolerable from a hemodynamic and hemostatic perspective . 
Agree with switching to short term beta blocker , and holding lasix for now given apparent volume depletion . 
Continue high dose statin , ARB , and low dose CCB for BP control . 
If UGIB continues to stabilize would prefer to maintain on H 2 blocker rather than PPI to limit interference with antiplatelet therapy with plavix . 
Will follow with you . 
She was in her usual state of health until about 2 - 3 weeks ago when she was admitted to [ * * Hospital * * ] Hospital with shortness of breath and diagnosed with a RLE DVT and PE . 
She was started on heparin ggt , however she developed a rectus sheath hematoma , so this was stopped and an IVC filter was placed . 
She was discharged home around [ * * 1 1 - 7 * * ] and had been well until 3 days ago when she developed acute onset of R . lower back pain and right groin pain . 
This progressed over the past 3 days until she came to the ED . 
Right : has bilateral faciotomies ( lateral and medial ) , the medial is beefy and granulating , the lateral s / p debridement at the bedside [ * * 1 2 - 2 0 * * ] , is mildly cellulitic around , no exudate , medial thigh staples are intact , incision is healed and well anastomosed . 
The right groin has an area of wound dehescense with clean and beefy base . 
Low precordial lead QRS voltage is non - specific and tracing is probably within normal limits . 
No previous tracing available for comparison . 
QRS configuration in leads III and aVF raises the consideration of prior inferior myocardial infarction although is non - diagnostic . 
Otherwise , tracing may be within normal limits but unstable baseline and baseline artifacts in lead V 3 makes assessment difficult . 
Clinical correlation is suggested . 
Since the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 5 8 - 1 1 - 2 0 * * ] axis is more leftward with a change in QRS configuration in lead aVF and late precordial QRS transition is present . 
Otherwise , there may be no significant change . 
Portable TTE ( Complete ) Done [ * * 2 1 5 8 - 1 1 - 2 2 * * ] at 9 : 3 1 : 2 6 AM FINAL : The left atrium is dilated . 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal . 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP < 1 2 mmHg ) .

History of Present Illness : 6 6 yoM with significant CAD s / p CABG ( [ * * 2 1 2 5 * * ] ) , DES to SVG - D 1 / OM x 2 ( [ * * 2 1 3 5 * * ] , [ * * 2 1 3 8 * * ] ) who presents with chest pain . The patient has a significant cardiac history with CABG ( LIMA - LAD , SVG - D 1 / OM , SVT - PDA ) and DES to ostial SVG - D 1 / OM , proximal SVG - D 1 / OM , PCI with DES to ostial SVG - D 1 / OM and DES to proximal SVG - D 1 / OM . 
He has been on Plavix 7 5 mg daily and full dose Aspirin . 
However , on Tuesday , 1 0 days prior to presentation , the patient underwent a lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteral stent and foley bag and his Plavix was held . 
He is currently 1 0 days off Plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware . 
The patient reports his current symptoms began this morning when he developed sudden onset , dull , substernal chest pain while walking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership . 
The pain was associated with diaphoresis , and subsequently developed nausea while being transported to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED . 
His symptoms were noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms of epigastric pain . 
He presented to a fire station where they gave him full dose aspirin and transported him to the [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ED . 
The patient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain and precordial pain when he reached the ED .

Cardiac Catheterization ( [ * * 1 2 - 1 3 * * ] ) : COMMENTS : 1 . 
Selective coronary angiography of this right - dominant system demonstrated native three vessel CAD . 
The LMCA had no angiographically - apparent lesions . 
The LAD was occluded proximally , and had a 9 0 % stenosis just distal to the LIMA - LAD touchdown . 
The LCX was occluded in the mid - vessel segment with faint collaterals to the OMB . 
The dominant RCA was occluded in the proximal vessel segment . 
Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA - LAD . 
There was 9 0 % stenosis in the native LAD just distal to the LIMA - LAD anastamosis . 
Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a totally occluded SVG - D 1 / OM 1 graft at the proximal segment of ostial stent . 
The SVG - PDA graft was patent to the RCA , but had a 9 0 % retrograde stenosis to the PLSA / PLB .

Consideration of PCI vs . redo CABG . 
Chest CT ( [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] ) : IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Post - CABG changes and scattered areas of calcified atherosclerotic disease in the aortic arch and aortic valve / annulus but none in the ascending aorta . 
Subtle ground - glass opacities in the right upper and right lower lobes , possibly representing areas of aspiration . 
A 3 - mm right lower lobe nodule ; given the patient ' s history , a one - year followup CT is recommended to document stability . 
CXR : [ * * 2 1 4 0 - 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] : PA and lateral chest compared to [ * * 1 2 - 2 1 * * ] through 2 9 : The already improved post - operative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable . 
Moderate right pleural effusion and moderately severe right basal atelectasis are unchanged , but previous left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion are improved . 
The patient ' s symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing Plavix 1 0 days ago for a lithotripsy . 
Initial set of CE ' s were negative but subsequent up - trended with CK peak 6 9 1 and MB peak 7 7 . 
He was on a Heparin gtt and was plavix loaded , and his chest pain was controlled on a Nitro gtt prior to cardiac catheterization . 
Integrillin gtt and Morphine IV prn were started prior to catheterization for recurrent chest pain refractory to up - titration of Nitro gtt . 
Cardiac catheterization [ * * 1 2 - 1 3 * * ] showed completely occluded SVG - D 1 / OM , 9 0 % stenosis of SVG - PDA , known 9 0 % LAD stenosis just distal to touchdown . 
He was recommended for CABG - redo and was continued on Heparin gtt and Integrillin gtt post - cath with the plan of continuing through until CABG - redo . 
Plavix was discontinued at that time . 
The patient had an acute drop in his platelets ( described below ) and Integrillin gtt was discontinued . 
Shortly thereafter , he had a presyncopal episode on [ * * 1 2 - 1 6 * * ] during which he stood up , became pale , lightheaded , and developed mild left sided chest pain . 
Vitals were stable but EKG showed new ST depressions in two leads , CE ' s negative . 
He was transfused 1 unit PRBC for anemia ( had previously refused transfusion ) with resolution of symptoms but persistent ST depressions on EKG . 
Heparin gtt was discontinued but 5 - H risk score for HIT was low and HIT Ab was negative . 
The patient remained chest pain free until CABG - redo on Tue . 
Although the patient ' s thrombocytopenia occurred later than expected for integrillin - induced thrombocytopenia , the precipitous drop and extended period of time he was on integrillin both support this as the most likely etiology . 
Plt dropped from 1 5 0 - > 1 0 in 2 4 hrs . 
Integrillin drip was stopped at 2 pm on [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] and he has been given a total of 3 units of platelets . 
HIT Antibody was also sent which was negative . 
However , Heparin gtt was discontinued in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patient has been chest pain free . 
In the setting of thrombocytopenia , he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheter and recent lithotrypsy procedure , which was switched to a 3 - way foley on CBI . 
His hct has down - trended and he received a total of 1 unit PRBC on [ * * 1 2 - 1 6 * * ] . 
He was also given several platelet transfusions for the thrombocytopenia . 
The anticipated platelet recovery with integrillin - induced thrombocytopenia is 4 hours to 5 days , and the patient ' s platelets slowly up - trended and by [ * * 1 2 - 1 9 * * ] he was in the 1 0 0 s . 
Foley leg bag in place , dark red urine in setting of Plavix , Heparin gtt , ASA 3 2 5 . 
Urology followed pt inhouse . 
Patient had significant bleeding from around the foley and it was replaced with a 3 - way foley catheter on CBI . 
Urology planned to remove ureteral stent and foley and following CABG . 
Repeat UA suspicious for UTI , started Cipro [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] . 
Repeat UA today in setting of culture showing " probable " enterococcus previously in the setting of significant blood in urine and improved urine currently . 
Repeat UA and UCx sent after bleeding hematuria improved . 
The patient was treated with Cipro 2 5 0 mg x 7 days for complicated cysistits in male with recent urologic procedure . 
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated . 
He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated . 
Pressors were weaned off . 
All lines and drains were discontinued per protocol . 
Beta - blocker / Statin / Aspirin and diuresis initiated . 
POD # 1 he transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring . 
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility . 
As discussed with Urology , the foley catheter was discontinued per csurg protocol . 
The following morning he failed to void and the foley was reinserted . 
A second void trial was done on POD # 4 and he voided . 
The remainder of his postoperative course was essentially uneventful . 
He continued to progress and on POD 5 he was cleared for discharge to home with VNA . 
All follow up appointments were advised .

This is a 7 6 year old man with multiple medical problems including chronic systolic CHF , interstitial lung disease , COPD ( baseline 2 L NC at night ) , CKD , and PVD presenting with sudden onset of SOB 7 am this morning and bloody , frothy sputum . 
Patient reports feeling well yesterday and rather acute development of this this AM . 
He denies any fevers or chills prior to arriving in the ED . 
He denies any other localizing symptoms of infection likey dysuria , diarrhea , or abdominal pain . 
He [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) 6 5 3 * * ] EMS for his dyspnea and was put on 1 0 0 % NRB oxygen and brought to the ED . 
In the ED , initial vs were : T 1 0 0 . 4 ( 1 0 2 rectal ) , P 8 0 , BP 1 6 5 / 7 1 , RR 3 4 , O 2 9 6 % on NRB . 
He was started on CPAP with improvement in his O 2 sats and in his work of breathing . 
Given his relatively high blood pressures and concern of some element of flash pulmonary edema , he was started on a NTG drip , but then developed hypotension with SBP ' s in the 7 0 ' s to 8 0 ' s , which failed to improve with discontinuation of the NTG . 
Therefore , he was started on peripheral dopamine before having a femoral line placed at which point he was transitioned to norepinephrine for presumed pneumosepsis and hypotension ( lactate was 3 . 8 ) . 
CXR showed bilateral multifocal infiltrates so he received ceftriaxone / vancomycin / azithromycin empirically . 
Vitals prior to transfer were P 6 8 , BP 9 0 / 3 4 ( up from 7 0 ' s off pressors ) , RR 2 2 , 1 0 0 % on 5 of CPAP . 
In the MICU , the patient reported feeling better and was able to nod or shake his head to answer questions . 
Still using accessory muscles to breathe . 
He was asking for CPAP to be removed .

Family History : His brother deceased in 7 0 ' s . 
No family history of early cardiac disease . 
Digoxin Level ( [ * * 6 - 5 * * ] ) : 0 . 4 . 
Imaging : CXR : [ * * 5 - 1 9 * * ] A left - sided pacer demonstrates leads in the right atrium , right ventricle and coronary sinus . 
The heart size is enlarged . 
Mediastinal contours are somewhat obscured by bilateral fluffy appearing opacities . 
Calcified atherosclerotic disease is noted in the aortic knob . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen . 
No pneumothorax . 
IMPRESSION : Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema , increased compared with prior study . 
CXR : [ * * 5 - 1 9 * * ] As compared to the previous radiograph , the patient has been intubated . 
The tip of the tube projects 4 . 8 cm above the carina . 
Nasogastric tube in situ , the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach . 
Unchanged course and position of the pacemaker leads . 
The pre - existing parenchymal opacities show minimal regression at the level of the bases of the lungs ; in the more apical lung regions , however , the severity of the opacities is unchanged . 
Increasing retrocardiac atelectasis . 
The presence of bilateral small pleural effusions cannot be excluded . 
No evidence of pneumothorax . 
CXR : [ * * 5 - 2 2 * * ] Since prior examination , mild improvement in still severe airspace opacity involving the right upper lobe , though with worsening of severe opacity in the left retrocardiac region that is likely component of effusion and / or atelectasis . 
Othwise stable diffuse multifocal opacification . 
Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions . 
Stable cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta . 
Persistent mild pulmonary [ * * Month / Year ( 2 ) 1 1 0 6 * * ] engorgement . 
IMPRESSION : Grossly stable combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema . 
Increased severe left basal atelectasis . 
CXR : [ * * 5 - 3 1 * * ] Moderate cardiomegaly is stable . 
Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the standard position in the right atrium , right ventricle and through the coronary sinus . 
There is no evident pneumothorax . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged . 
Bilateral diffuse opacities that were a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia have markedly improved . 
Multiple etiologies were considered to explain his hypoxic respiratory failure . 
At baseline patient has interstitial lung disease and COPD . 
Given fever , leukocytosis , sputum , elevated lactate multifocal pneumonia was also considered and ultimately treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime . 
Unfortunately , all sputum cultures were contaminated . 
During patient ' s MICU stay he was diuresed with IV lasix gien concern for a possible element of volume overload as well though BNP , while elevated , was less than previous values on admission for CHF exacerbation . 
PE was considered however thought to be unlikely given evidence for multiple other processes to explain respiratory failure . 
Further , patient was anticoagulated making PE less likely . 
With history of COPD steroid taper was started as well as standing nebs . 
Patient was eventually weaned to 2 L NC and transferred to the floor . 
On the floor patient finished the course of antibiotics for HAP , continued diuresis , and standing nebs . 
He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint until [ * * 5 - 3 1 * * ] whent he patient was found to be somnolent with decreased respiratory drive and ABG 7 . 3 0 / 7 1 / 1 4 6 / 3 6 . 
Patient was then transferred to the MICU where mental status cleared and hypercarbic respiratory failure resolved . 
This somnolence and diminished respiratory drive was thought to be secondary to small increase in the patient ' s gabapentin dose which he was taking for post herpetic neuralgias . 
After patient returned to the floor he was continued on a small dose of PO lasix per outpatient regimen , prednisone taper , and standing nebs . 
Because the patient was deconditioned and continued to have desats the mid 8 0 s on 2 L while ambulating he was discharged to rehab . 
His ABG at the time was 7 . 3 0 / 7 1 / 1 4 6 / 3 6 . 
His O 2 was removed to see if his respiratory drive was depressed , but he desatted down to 7 0 % and needed to have the oxygen replaced . 
Transferred to the MICU as noted above . 
This AMS was in the setting of neurontin dosing for zoster related ear pain . 
He was monitored and improved in the ICU with very little intervention other than holding his neurontin . 
All sputum cultures were contaminated and urine legionella was negative . 
Given history of MRSA and multifocal infiltrate patient was treated with Vanc , Cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia . 
Initially patient required norepinephrine which was quickly weaned . 
Given concern for adrenal insufficiency stress dose steroids were initiated at 5 0 mg IV hydrocortisone Q 6 hrs . 
This was weaned to PO hydrocrotisone twice daily . 
Eventually , blood pressures stabilized and anti hypertensive agents were restarted . 
During his stay he was diuresed with IV lasix and then converted to 2 0 mg PO lasix at the time of discharge . 
Patient was continued on QOD digoxin and while his beta blocker and [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] were initially held these were restarted prior to discharge . 
Throughout the hospitalization creatinine fluctuated between 1 . 3 - 2 depending on the degree of diuresis . 
Nephrotoxins were avoided when possible . 
Coumadin was continued while inpatient . 
During admission INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held . 
During this time as noted below patient developed GI Bleed which reguired reversal of INR and heparin gtt . 
At discharge patient will continue coumadin per home regimen 2 . 5 mg Daily , except Tuesdays when he will take 1 . 5 mg . 
Once blood pressures stabilized patient was transitioned to home hydrocortisone regimen . 
As an outpatient patient recieves EPO injections Monthly . 
During admission patients HCT trended down in the setting of supratherapeutic INR and GI bleed as noted below . 
Patient was transfused two units pRBCs when HCT < 2 1 . 
HCT will be followed as an outpatient and EPO injections will be continued . 
No vision changes or eye involvement . 
Patient was continued on gabapentin 3 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Post herpetic neuralgias continued to bother patient during the hospitalization , patient reported [ * * 1 2 - 6 * * ] pain , and gabapentin was increased to 4 0 0 mg TID . 
The day following this change the patient became increasingly somnolent as noted above . 
Gabapentin at that time was stopped with improvement in mental status . 
Scheduled tylenol was continued for pain . 
Narcotics and neurontin were avoided given the somnolence noted above . 
INR was reversed with Vit K 5 mg PO , GI was consulted , and IV PPI 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] was started . 
HCT was followed and was relatively stable . 
GI deferred endoscopy given the patient ' s stability and poor respiratory status given concern the patient would reguire intubation for the procedure . 
At discharge patient will continue Omeprazole 4 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] will arrange for further GI evaluation once patient is optomized from a respiratory standpoint . 
The longest run of NSVT was 2 2 beats during which patient was asymptomatic . 
Patient has BiV ICD in place .

The most significant change has been the great increase in size of multiple large pulmonary nodules . 
There is no good evidence for pneumonia and none for pulmonary edema , nor is pleural effusion substantial . 
There is a severe resting LVOT gradient . 
The aortic valve is severely thickened with significant stenosis ( unable to estimate valve are due to difficulty in measuring LVOT diameter and presence of LVOT obstruction ) . 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation . 
Small , circumferential effusion without evidence of tamponade . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 2 - 3 * * ] , the findings are similar . 
Since the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 2 - 1 7 * * ] the rate is faster and the QRS voltage in lead aVL is less prominent with a more vertical axis . 
ST - T wave abnormalities are more prominent . 
Clinical correlation is suggested . 
Interval progression with larger pulmonary metastases , adenopathy and new hepatic metastasis . 
No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome . 
Mild pulmonary artery dilation with moderate pericardial effusion . 
Brief Hospital Course : Mrs . [ * * Known lastname 2 5 0 0 6 * * ] is a 7 2 year old female with stage IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with hypotension . 
Differential diagnosis included sepsis ( perhaps [ * * 3 - 1 8 * * ] cellulitis of LE ' s , but without other obvious infectious source ) , hypovolemia ( but appeared volume overloaded on exam ) , CHF with 3 rd spacing of volume but intravascular volume depletion , versus medication ( chemotherapy ) side effect . 
Differential also included pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE . 
With treatment of CHF ( diuresis with one - time doses of lasix ) and of cellulitis ( with antibiotics ) , saw patient ' s BP improve . 
Antihypertensives held during hospitalization and on discharge . 
Appears patient ' s baseline SBP is in the 9 0 s . 
Patient ambulated without lightheadedness . 
Was voume overloaded on exam , with crackles , peripheral edema , weight elevation , BNP elevation . 
Other possibilites include worsening of HOCM , or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on CT in [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 2 - 1 4 * * ] which may have further reduced pulmonary reserve . 
With diuresis , patient ' s oxygen requirement resolved , albeit slowly . 
CTA was done to rule out PE - negative for PE . 
Patient ambulated without SOB and without desaturation . 
In fact , SpO 2 improved with ambulation , so perhaps there was an atelectatic component ( heard as crackles at the bases perhaps ) that improved with opening up of airways upon ambulation . 
Could be cellulitis vs . hyperemia from edema vs . reaction to chemotherapy medications ( patient reports redness in legs previously when on this chemotherapy regimen ) . 
Patient treated with vancomycin and then keflex . 
Patient diuresed with lasix one - time doses . 
Was 2 . 2 at OSH and became 1 . 3 after getting IV hydration . 
Seemed pre - renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w / IV fluids ; then patient was diuresed for CHF / volume overload concern , and Cr continued to improve down to 0 . 8 . . 
Ruled out PE with CTA . 
Baseline is 3 5 - 4 0 . 
Not clinically bleeding . 
Perhaps due to chemotherapy .

We believe that your symptoms were due to fluid overload , so you were diuresed with lasix and your breathing ( oxygen level ) improved . 
We ruled out a clot in the lungs , and did an echocardiogram to show that your heart function was similar to previously . 
We are treating you for a skin infection of the legs , with antibiotics , and your legs are improving in terms of their redness , pain , and swelling . 
It is unclear why your blood pressure was low , but with diuresis ( fluid removal ) and treatment of infection , your blood pressure improved up to baseline . 
You spent time in the ICU , and then on the regular oncology floor . 
On discharge , you were walking well without a need for oxygen , your blood pressure had improved / elevated , and your leg symptoms were improving . 
The following changes were made to your medication regimen : - take Keflex ( cephalexin ) , an antibiotic , twice a day until the evening of [ * * 4 - 1 9 * * ] - do NOT take your Hyzaar ( HCTZ / Losartan ) or Verapamil , until next week when you see your cardiologist or come to the hospital for chemotherapy ( we are holding these medications temporarily because of your borderline - low blood pressure ) . 
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop chest pain , shortness of breath , weight gain greater than 2 pounds , palpitations , difficulty breathing , abdominal pain , worsening leg swelling / redness / pain , lightheadedness . 
Followup Instructions : Please come to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] and go to the [ * * Location ( un ) 4 3 6 * * ] of the [ * * Hospital Ward Name 1 9 5 0 * * ] building on Thursday [ * * 4 - 2 4 * * ] , at approximately 9 AM .

Chest imaging did not show any focal process but was concerning for either fluid overload or an inflammatory process . 
A BNP was ~ 2 0 0 . 
He was initially diuresed for suspected CHF exacerbation and started on levo / flagyl ( later ceftriaxone , azithromycin , flagyl ) for possible pneumonia . 
He failed to improve on diuretics and antibiotics . 
An echo showed no evidence of significant systolic dysfunction ( EF 5 0 % ) . 
On the second day of hospitalization sputem cultures showed PCP and he was started on IV bactrim and IV steroids . 
His oxygen requirement significantly improved over the next two days and he had oxygen saturations ~ 9 5 % on 3 L NC at the time of transfer to the floor . 
On medicine floor , pt continued to improved ; O 2 sat requirement decreased and was able to take POs . 
Pt discharged to rehab to complete course of abx ( PO bactrim DS 3 tabs TID , 2 1 days [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 8 8 0 3 3 * * ] per ID ) and recovery . 
ID consult was obtained for management of PCP in [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) * * ] newly diagnosed HIV patient and it was agreed to continue with IV bactrim and steroids ( 3 wk course , switched to PO prednisone on [ * * 2 1 8 8 - 1 2 - 2 1 * * ] at 4 0 mg x 5 days the 2 0 mg prednisone x 1 1 days ) . 
HAART therapy was not initiated at this time in the setting of acute PCP infection and concern for immune reconstitution . 
Arrangements were made for outpatient follow up with ID ( see discharge plan information ) . 
Details of acquisition not discussed in detail but per patient he thinks likely within past 6 months . 
Please note that his family and HCP ( his superior ) do not know ; at this point , pt is not ready to tell them . 
As pt was able to tolerate POs , both meds and food , and began having more normal BMs , pt was transitioned to PO bactrim per ID to complete his course of abx . 
Initially asymptomatic , found by chest CT which peripancreatic fluid tracking into left pararenal space . 
Lipase was noted to be elevated at 1 4 4 6 and amylase at 4 5 5 . 
RUQ ultrasound showed fatty infiltration of liver but otherwise no biliary ductal dilatation and no peripancreatic fluid collection . 
Treated with bowel rest and IVF . 
Lipase rapidly resolved . 
Pt was then able to advance diet and take POs . 
Previously treated with Asacol but stopped due to poor toleration . 
On bunetinide oral steroids at time of admission in addition to PO cipro and flagyl which was started ~ 3 months prior to admission for bloody diarrhea with good results ( these were all stopped and NOT restarted at discharge ) . 
Evaluated by GI in house and felt appropriate for outpatient follow up . 
However , given HIV status , ID was concerned that a diagnosis of Crohn ' s so late in life was unusually and felt that another OI may be the cause given pt ' s CD 4 was 1 0 . 
CMV and LGV were both negative . 
ID and PCP [ * * Name 9 ( PRE ) 7 0 2 * * ] scheduled , will arrange GI follow - up as other issues are address and concern for other OI ruled out .

Becuase your condition was very grave , you were admitted to the ICU for care . 
Inititally , there was concern that you had heart failure and you received medications that helped to remove the excess fluid from your body that was contributing to your worsening respiratory status . 
Later it was determined that you had a very serious pneumonia and that you were immunocompromised . 
You required significant supplemental oxygen to help you keep the level of oxygen in your blood at a safe level . 
You were started on IV antibiotics . 
Initially , you had difficulting taking anything by mouth because of severe nausea , vomiting and diarrhea ; this was improved by bowel rest , IV medication and supportive care . 
You continued to improve and were able to be transferred out of the ICU to the regular medicine floor . 
You supplemenatly oxygen needs decreased and your respiratory status improved . 
As your diarrhea , nausea and vomitting had subsided and you were able to take food and medicine effectively by mouth . 
You were then able to be discharge to a rehabilitation facility to complete your recovery . 
The following changes were made to your medications : - Please START taking Bactrim DS 3 tabs three times a day to complete a 2 1 day course started on [ * * 1 2 - 1 5 * * ] and ending on [ * * 1 - 5 * * ] . 
You will likely need to remain on a lower dose of Bactrim after you complete the current course ; this lower dose will help to prevent future pneumonias of the same type . 
Please be sure to discuss this with your doctors . 
The need for these medication should be discussed with your doctors as [ * * Name 5 ( PTitle ) * * ] [ * * Name 5 ( PTitle ) * * ] or may not need to restart them or a different medication may be prescribed . 
Please be sure to take all medication as prescribed . 
Also , you will need to have weekly blood labs performed to follow your red blood cell count given your anemia . 
This will be important for management and treatment purposes . 
Please discuss this with your docotrs . 
Please be sure to keep all follow - up appointments with your PCP and other healthcare providers . 
It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you a speedy recovery . 
Followup Instructions : Please be sure to keep all follow - up appointments with your PCP and other healthcare providers . 
Patient had a head CT performed at [ * * Hospital 4 0 7 9 6 * * ] which was reported as showing right temporal and parietal edema and small foci of hemorrhage , though the images were not sent with the patient upon transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
According to discharge paperwork from [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] today , the patient originally presented to the hospital on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 2 1 * * ] with intractable nausea and vomiting of 5 days duration . 
While at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] , the patient had several abdominal films as well as an upper GI series which were reportedly unremarkable . 
Physicians were concerned that there was a central cause of nausea and attempted head imaging , which the patient initially refused . 
Late on night of [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] , patient was found to be minimally responsive with head turning to right and arms flexed to chest . 
As he had received nortriptyline , there was initial concern for a dystonic reaction and 5 0 mg IV diphenhydramine was pushed . 
There was no improvement in his mental status following that intervention and he was intubated for ariway protection and head CT was then performed with results as above . 
Transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] was requested given patient ' s decline in mental status requiring intubation . 
Of note , patient was recently admitted to [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] on [ * * 1 2 - 1 4 * * ] with hypercalcemia and a pseudomonas infection of stage IV pressure ulcer . 
He completed antibiotic course of ceftazidime , daptomycin , and azithromycin . 
Unknown level of ambulation immediately prior to presentation to [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 2 1 * * ] ; however , at time of discharge from [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] , he could stand and walk about 1 0 feet . 
A recent neurology note from [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 4 * * ] assessed his IP strength as being 1 on the right and 0 on the left . 
Vincristine was stopped due to concern that it might be causing severe polyneuropathy - treatment complicated by mucositis and pancytopenia requiring neupogen - now in remission 2 ) Pituitary Macroadenoma 3 ) Acromegaly 4 ) h / o Respiratory Failure with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 7 - 1 2 * * ] to [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 7 - 3 0 * * ] - - did well with PSV , had large TV ( 7 0 0 - 8 0 0 ) and MV ( > 1 0 ) 5 ) h / o Mycoplasma hominis PNA treated with cipro and doxy 6 ) Sinus Tachycardia with PVCs - - had significant work - up with TSH , TTE . 
Felt to be physiologic given lymphoma , infection , acromegaly . 
Patient has a 1 9 yr old son in [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] . 
Prior to his recent hospitalization , he was living in automobile . 
Discharged to [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] and currently living at Wood Mill Skilled Nursing Facility . 
Limited study due to patient motion despite five repeat attempts . 
Round mild densities in the temporal lobes , and possibly increased density interdigitating with the sulci . 
Note additional history obtained of Burkitt ' s lymphoma . 
The findings may relate to lymphoma involvement , less likely parenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage , though not quite as dense as typical hemorrhage products , especially in temporal lobes . 
Enlarged pituitary gland , better evaluated on recent MR pituitary . 
These findings were discussed with Dr . [ * * First Name 8 ( NamePattern 2 ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) 4 0 1 1 * * ] at 9 : 0 0 p . m . [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] , at which time MRI had been ordered and the patient had been brought for MRI . 
Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the right greater than left temporal and parietal lobes , with more focal areas of parenchymal abnormality in the temporal lobe , also right greater than left . 
Differential diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent lymphoma ( especially given the patient ' s history of Burkitt ' s lymphoma ) as well as a meningoencephalitis such as herpes encephalitis , although other viral or bacterial meningoencephalitides could also result in a similar appearance . 
Areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal disease with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right hippocampus , which may represent acute infarcts , although they may be related to lymphomatous involvement versus infectious process given the findings above . 
Hypoxic injury would be a less likely differential consideration . 
Suboptimal MRA and MRV given patient motion . 
There is no definite evidence of venous thrombosis , although the sigmoid sinuses and the visualized internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated . 
No evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis on the MRA of the head , although irregularity at the anterior communicating artery raises the possibility of a small aneurysm . 
This was suboptimally evaluated given the degree of patient motion . 
At the time of followup imaging , the MRA sequence could be repeated . 
Pituitary adenoma , not significantly changed since the prior examination when accounting for differences in technique , although dedicated imaging of the sella was not obtained today . 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2 D or color Doppler . 
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0 - 1 0 mmHg . 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal . 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
There is probably mild global left ventricular hypokinesis ( LVEF = 4 5 - 5 0 % ) . 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation . 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . 
There is a small pericardial effusion . 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 8 - 1 3 * * ] , the LVEF is less vigorous . 
The pericardial effusion is slightly larger but still with no evidence for overt tamponade . 
There is bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis . 
The right Port - A - Cath is unchanged . 
Question of increased hypodensity in the mid brain , recommend correlation with MRI to exclude the possibility of ischemia . 
No evidence of pneumothorax , no pleural effusion . 
Mild retrocardiac atelectasis . 
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia , no overhydration . 
Brief Hospital Course : 4 1 year old gentleman with h / o acromegaly and high grade B - cell lymphoma ( s / p admission at [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] from [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 7 - 1 1 * * ] to [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] ) who was transferred from [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] following episode of altered mental status early on day of admission , [ * * 1 2 - 2 4 * * ] , that led to intubation for airway protection . 
Lymphoma : He initially presented to [ * * Hospital 6 5 0 1 6 * * ] with nausea and vomiting . 
On admission here , an LP was done that showed a high opening pressure ( 4 9 ) and multiple atypical cells concerning for recurrent CNS lymphoma . 
He was started on high - dose Decadron and was followed by Medical Oncology , Neuro - oncology , and Radiation Oncology . 
His presenting symptoms were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma . 
Given his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy , he was not considered a candidate for chemotherapy . 
He began palliative full brain XRT on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 2 8 * * ] . 
His clinical condition deteriorated and his respiratory status worsened and he was only able to have one treatment . 
On [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 2 9 * * ] a discussion with the health care proxy led to Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] being made comfort measures only . 
He died on [ * * 2 1 4 4 - 1 2 - 3 1 * * ] at 4 : 4 0 pm . 
He was initially treated with Acyclovir for HSV , however this was stopped due to low clinical suspicion . 
His mental status did not improve off sedation . 
His mental status deteriorated to the point where he was not responsive , likely related to his CNS lymphoma and increased ICP . 
Endotracheal intubation / extubation : He was intubated for airway protection at an OSH prior to admission . 
He self - extubated two days after admission without complication . 
He remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three days prior to death but was made comfort measures only . 
Pneumonia : At admission , he spiked a temperature , had copious secretions and a consolidation in the RUL on chest x - ray . 
Vancomycin and Cefepime were started on [ * * 1 2 - 2 5 * * ] for a planned 8 day course , which was stopped early when the goals of care were changed . 
This was deferred due to his poor clinical status . 
It appeared uninfected on admission and was followed by the wound care team . 
Code Status : He was initially full code during this hospitalization , but after he clinically worsened with severe alteration in mental status , he was made DNR / DNI and eventually comfort measures only .

She has been lost to follow up with us since [ * * 2 1 0 1 * * ] . 
In the mean time she was being seen by Dr [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 2 5 1 7 * * ] [ * * Name ( STitle ) 1 6 9 9 1 * * ] at the Mass eye and ENT infirmary . 
Since [ * * 2 1 0 1 * * ] she had three tracheostomy tube changed with laser ablation of the subglottic lesion . 
She had the tracheostomy tube removed between [ * * 2 1 0 4 * * ] and [ * * 2 1 0 5 * * ] and has also weaned off the oxygen . 
Over the last three months she has been progressively more short of breath with worsening stridor . 
She has had three pneumonia over the last year , never needing admission to hospital . 
Treated with Solu - Medrol and antibiotics including a antifungal . 
She has also developed increasing DOE - she could climb one flight of stairs , now she has to go very slow . 
The voice is more horse , and noisy . 
She finds herself tired and fatigued . 
Cough is productive of brown phlegm . 
She underwent a scheduled rigid brochoscopy with balloon dilation to her tracheal stenosis . 
Subsequently , she had difficulty after extubation in the PACU . 
She develop stridor and became agitated . 
She appear hypoxic and she was re - intubated , which was proven to be difficult . 
She transciently became bradycardic for < 3 0 seconds , which improved with bag - mouth ventalation . 
She recieved dexamethasone 5 mg x 1 dose post - op . 
Bronchoscopy was performed after re - intubation and no obvious source of stridor was found . 
She is now being transfer to the TSICU for further management . 
On arrival to the T - SICU , initial VS were : 9 9 1 1 2 1 1 8 / 5 2 2 0 on CMV Tv : 3 5 0 by 2 0 5 over 5 with FIO 2 of 1 0 0 % .

Paralyzed left true cord . 
Skin : multiple scalely purple annular macules throughout body , including abdomen , arms , less , face , scalp . 
No obvious oral lesion . 
The patient is intubated , the ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea , 5 cm above the level of the carina . 
No pneumothorax or any other placement - related complication can be identified . 
An NG tube has been assed and reaches well below the diaphragm including its side port . 
External instruments and lines are overlying the right apical area , but there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate anywhere in the lungs , and the lateral pleural sinuses are free . 
Skeletal structures grossly within normal limits on this single view AP chest examination . 
The next preceding chest examination of this patient in our records is dated [ * * 2 1 0 2 - 1 - 1 0 * * ] and did not show any acute pulmonary abnormalities . 
There is no focal infiltrate . 
There is blunting of the right CP angle , consistent with small effusion . 
There is a linear lucency under the left hemidiaphragm that does not conform to the expected position of the stomach and is unclear if this represents free air . 
This finding was called to Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 3 6 5 1 * * ] at 4 : 2 0 p . m . on [ * * 2 1 1 0 - 8 - 1 0 * * ] after noticing this finding at 4 : 1 8 p . m . 
Recommend clinical correlation and followup x - ray . 
A flexible bronchoscopy done in the PACU showed some subglottic edema and the stenosis was patent . 
She was reintubated and admitted to the ICU . 
There she received a RIJ central line for access and ENT was consulted who performed a fiberopstic evaluation where they did not see any evidence of stenosis and it was felt to be most consistent with laryngospasm . 
She was treated with 2 4 hours of decadron and then successfully extubated . 
She was monitored by IP and will require follow - up with them in the future to reassess her hoarseness .

Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - Independent . 
You were admitted to the hospital after you had a procedure to open up your trachea and you had some difficulty breathing after the procedure . 
The breathing tube was placed back in your throat and you were admitted to the ICU for a couple of days and had the breathing tube removed . 
It is felt that the problem breathing was likely due to a spasm of the muscles in your throat . 
You are now safe to go home . 
She is now 5 2 and has long - standing insulin dependant diabetes with a h / o retinopathy OS , possible peripheral neuropathy but not known nephropathy . 
She had a maximal negative exercise test in 2 0 5 9 and has felt generally well since that time . 
Over the past year she has not been as careful as previously with her diet and has not been checking her sugars regularly . 
A random cholesterol w / i the past year was over 3 0 0 . 
She has intermittently had sharp , brief discomforts of the anterior chest lasting only seconds and not accompanied by dyspnea , diaphoresis or light - headedness . 
There has not been any reduction in her physical capacity , in fact , she feels stronger than a year ago and is working full - time . 
There has been no orthopnea , PND or peripheral edema . 
She is interested in increasing her physical activity program . 
Cardiac risk factors include remote smoking , stopped by age 2 0 , hypercholesterolemia and family history in that her father developed coronary disease possibly in his 5 0 ' s . 
She is perimenopausal and has discussed later estrogen usage with her gynecologist Dr . Bradley Brandt . 
Her only medication is lente insulin taken twice per day . 
BP 1 1 0 / 7 6 , HR 8 0 and reg . 
No JVD . 
Carotids full w / o bruits . 
Chest clr . 
Cardiac exam shows normal heart sounds w / o gallop or murmur . 
Abd . 
No peripheral edema . 
Resting EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal intervals and axis and is a normal tracing . 
For further evaluation of her chest discomforts and to help gauge her exercise program an exercise treadmill test was performed using the standard bruce protocol . 
She exercised for 9 minutes , 8 seconds and stopped because of knee discomfort but not because of chest pain or inordinate dyspnea . 
Peak heart rate was 1 4 3 ( 8 5 % maximal predicted ) with an appropriate rise in systolic pressure . 
There were no diagnostic changes of ischemia at this good work load . 
Compared to the test of 9 / 1 5 / 5 9 she exercised 1 minute , 4 seconds longer . 
No evidence of clinical coronary disease at this time . 
She has major risk factors of insulin dependant diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , family h / o coronary disease and a perimenopausal state . 
From a cardiac standpoint , post - menopausal estrogen therapy would be desired . 
Low dose aspirin therapy could also be considered .

Ivan M . Ing , M . D . 
Unfortunately she missed her entire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with her . 
She reports that at 4 a . m . last Thursday she woke up and felt disoriented with sweats . 
She checked her blood glucose , it was 5 0 , and she treated herself by eating . 
This led to resolution of her symptoms , although she said that she overshoots . 
She has developed a foot infection , has been seen by a podiatrist and started on antibiotics . 
She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she still feels that it is making her tired . 
She just in general has not been feeling as well as she had been previously . 
IDDM . 
Medications : See previous notes . 
Discussed the need for consistent meals and exercise and need for more control . 
Will increase day time insulin to 1 7 units of Lente and evening will stay at 1 0 . 
She will follow up in one month . 
Will check a TSH today .

At the same time she had increased gait instability leading to admission to SLMC . 
A head MRI was reportedly normal .

Her sugars are still not well controlled . 
She has been liberalizing her diet , which I thought was appropriate . 
I did increase her morning insulin to 2 0 units of 3 0 / 7 0 , and suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime to 8 units of 3 0 - 7 0 , taken with her supper , to try to give her a little better coverage for her evening meal . 
I wrote a note to the nurse to actuate this change . 
They actually called me later in the evening , on page , and I discussed this with them , at length , at that time , including the rationale for this change .

Sepsis secondary septic R knee : Patient was admitted with fever , leukocytosis , hypotension ( requiring IVF resuscitation and levophed for less than 2 4 hrs ) , and source of infection as septic R knee ( positive tap in ED ) , s / p instrumentation in the past . 
She has signs of organ dysfunction , mainly ARF . 
Pt was started on vanco / zosyn . 
Ortho was consulted and took the patient to the OR for total knee revision on [ * * 2 1 0 3 - 5 - 1 8 * * ] . 
Her instrumentation was removed and a temporary replacement was placed . 
The arthroplasty was sent for culture , which had no grown . 
Tissue from the surgery also had no growth , but all knee cultures were sent after recieving antibiotics . 
She had a TTE that did not visualize any vegetations though it was suboptimal . 
She also had an MRI of her entire spine to eval for other nidus of infection / abscess given BUE and RLE pain / weakness . 
The MRI showed no evidence of abscess , diskitis , or osteomyelitis . 
She was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone which she will continue for 6 weeks until she sees Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] in Infectious Disease clinic on [ * * 2 1 0 3 - 7 - 2 * * ] .

The patient will followup in [ * * Hospital 5 4 9 8 * * ] clinic on [ * * 2 1 0 3 - 6 - 5 * * ] for staple removal . 
She will have the hardware replaced in 6 weeks with orthopedics . 
She had a cortisol stimulation that was normal . 
She was not given steroids . 
Her antihypertensives were initially held , but restarted prior to discharge . 
Last admission she had also presented with Cr 3 . 4 that resolved to 1 . 4 after IVF . 
Her CKD is likely secondary to HTN / DM . 
Acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to hypovolemia ( pt given 3 L in ED ) plus septic physiology .

She is also on standing acetaminophen . 
Her Oxycontin can be uptitrated to 4 0 mg TID as an outpatient if needed . 
Initially , due to her mental status changes , it was thought that this was likely secondary to narcotics , especially post operatively . 
A head CT did not show any evidence of hemorrhage . 
It was felt that the likely cause of her altered mental status was the hydromorphone and her sepsis . 
Hydromorphone has been added to her allergy list . 
She is on ASA / plavix for secondary prevention .

Echo [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 6 - 2 3 * * ] Due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed ( LVEF = 2 0 - 2 5 % ) . 
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with global free wall hypokinesis . 
Mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
There is a very small pericardial effusion . 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad . 
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 5 - 1 6 * * ] , left and right ventricular systolic function have deteriorated significantly . 
Brief Hospital Course : 6 6 year old M with transfusion dependent MDS , D + 7 s / p allo SCT , normal pressure hydrocephalus , CAD , HTN and diabetes , who was initially electively admitted for allo SCT with clofarabine , total nodal radiation and anti - thymoglobulin . 
His course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and renal failure . 
His creatinine was 1 . 1 on admission and rose to > 5 following administration of clofarabine per SCT protocol . 
He developed metabolic acidosis and worsening confusion over the course of several days leading up to his transplant . 
On SCT day + 1 , he was febrile and started on vancomycin and cefepime . 
On SCT day + 3 , he was transferred to ICU for worsening mental status , increased respiratory distress , and renal failure . 
He remained febrile and was seen by the ID consult team and transitioned to meropenem + levofloxacin + voriconazole . 
He was intubated electively for multiple procedures including MRI , VP shunt tap ( by neurosurgery ) , and bronchoscopy and extubated the following day . 
He was started on ambisome in place of voriconazole for positive galactomannan on BAL ( presumed aspergillosis pneumonia ) . 
He was seen by the neprhology team and started on HD for presumed clofarabine toxicity . 
Mental status improved and he was called out to the BMT service . 
However , two days later he was at dialysis when he developed an episode of altered mental status associated with tachycardia , hypertension and hypoxia to 8 8 % on 2 L NC . 
His respiratory status continued to decline and he was reintubated and transferred to the ICU . 
In addition , he became hypotensive requiring pressors for a few hours ; pressors were eventually weaned off , although he then developed shock liver and probable DIC requiring multiple transfusions . 
Due to electrolyte derangements CVVH was started as well . 
His abx were broadened to double cover aspergillus ( posaconazole + ambisome ) , vanc was changed to dapto for VRE coverage , bactrim was added for PCP [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) 2 1 1 5 0 * * ] . 
At approximately 3 : 1 2 AM on [ * * 2 1 6 5 - 6 - 2 4 * * ] , housestaff were called to evaluate the patient after his nurse noticed his A - line pressure [ * * Location ( un ) 1 1 3 1 * * ] dropped abruptly to SBP in the 1 0 s - 2 0 s . 
On evaluation , he was unresponsive and did not have palpable pulses . 
At that time , back board was placed beneath patient and CPR was initiated . 
Pulseless electrical activity was noted on the monitor at interval 2 - minute pulse checks ( no shockable rhythm ) . 
He received epinephrine 1 mg IV x 2 doses at five minutes apart . 
Housestaff notified the patient ' s wife , who requested that the resuscitation be stopped . 
At this time , CPR was stopped and he did not receive further vasopressors . 
He did not regain a pulse . 
The monitor continued to show pulseless electrical activity for several minutes with slowing heart rate until asystole . 
At that time , the patient was examined and was noted to have no audible breath or heart sounds . 
His pupils were fixed and dilated to ~ 5 mm . 
There were not signs of life evident . 
The time of death was noted to be 3 : 2 3 AM . 
Attending physician [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
The patient ' s wife was then contact [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] regarding an autopsy and agreed to autopsy . 
Mr . Xuereb is a 5 5 - year - old white male who presents with an ischemic right foot . 
He has a longstanding history of lower extremity occlusive disease and has worked as a high school principle . 
He has undergone previous right SFA angioplasty in 2 0 5 9 , previous left SFA angioplasty and stent placement in 2 0 6 2 , previous right fem - pop above - knee bypass grafting in February 2 0 7 0 , previous left leg fem - pop bypass grafting with saphenous vein in April 2 0 7 0 and a redo right fem below - knee popliteal bypass graft with a bifid saphenous vein performed in September 2 0 7 0 . 
After this last procedure , the patient at the time of follow - up office visit was noted to have a nonfunctioning graft with an ischemic right lower extremity . 
He denies any history of trauma . 
He is a former smoker . 
He denies any history of hypercoagulable states or history of significant coronary disease . 
He does have longstanding non - insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as hypertension and COPD . 
Past surgical history is as above . 
Medications include Glucophage , Lopid , Prilosec , Norvasc , hydrochlorothiazide , Lipitor , Effexor , Plavix 7 5 mg q . d . , aspirin , albuterol , Serevent , Nasacort and Pulmicort . 
No known drug allergies . 
Review of systems is positive for diabetes , asthma and hypertension . 
All other review of systems is negative as per H & P sheet . 
Habits , he is a former tobacco smoker . 
He denies alcohol use . 
Family history is positive for MI , stroke and cancer . 
On physical exam , the patient is a well - developed and well - nourished male in moderate discomfort . 
Respiratory rate is 1 2 - 1 4 . 
Pulse is 6 0 - 7 0 and regular . 
Weight is 1 7 2 pounds . 
Blood pressure is 1 7 0 / 9 0 in the right arm , 1 5 0 / 9 0 in the left . 
No jugular venous distention . 
Normal respiratory effort . 
Lungs are clear to auscultation . 
Heart , regular rate and rhythm . 
No murmur or bruit . 
He has no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm . 
He has normal carotid , brachial , radial and femoral pulses bilaterally . 
Absent pedal pulses on the right with Doppler signals , which are monophasic . 
On the left side , he has adequately perfused foot with normal capillary refill and Doppler signals . 
He has moderate edema in the right lower extremity . 
No varicosities . 
He does have dependent rubor , cyanosis of the right forefoot and purplish discoloration of the tips of the right second to fifth toes . 
The right great toe is blanched . 
He has no abdominal masses , tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly . 
He has grossly intact musculoskeletal tone and strength with no dermatitis , ulcers or sores . 
He is alert and oriented to person , place and time with slightly depressed affect . 
Ischemic right lower extremity consistent with thrombosed bypass graft . 
We will plan to admit the patient for treatment with intravenous heparin and plan to schedule him for an urgent arteriogram within the next 2 4 hours . 
If this is unsuccessful , he will ultimately require redo fem - pop bypass graft . 
His previous angiogram did not reveal any evidence of any hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis . 
We will adjust him as appropriate from a medical standpoint . 
Non - insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . 
The patient ' s blood sugars are currently under good control on Glucophage , which we will need to hold post arteriogram . 
I will keep you informed as to the status of this very nice patient . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in his management . 
If I can be of any further assistance and management of this or any of your patients with cerebrovascular , aortic , renovascular or low peripheral vascular disease , particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure , please feel free to contact me directly . 
As you remember , he recently underwent a revision of his lower extremity bypass graft with thrombectomy of the fem - pop bypass graft and subsequent jump graft to the below - knee popliteal artery . 
He returns today for follow up evaluation . 
He has a warm , well - perfused foot with a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse . 
Unfortunately , over the last ten days he has developed increased erythema and tenderness on the medial aspect of his left knee with superficial skin breakdown consistent with either a staph or a strep cellulitis . 
He had been on a course of p . o . 
The patient has been increased his activity and prior to this time had been extremely active with no erythema , tenderness or drainage from his leg . 
My concern is that he has increased warmth with blanching and erythema on the medial aspect of his knee consistent with a superficial cellulitis and I believe that he would benefit from hospital admission with a course of IV antibiotics , bedrest and elevate . 
We will tentatively plan to admit him for localized wound care measures , treatment with IV Nafcillin on a q . 4 hour basis . 
In addition , he has intact femoral pulses on the left side . 
He does report when he was ambulating he was having increased difficulty with claudication in the distal left lower extremity and calf region . 
Most recent vascular lab studies dated November 2 9 , 2 0 7 0 reveal an ABI of 0 . 9 6 on the right , 0 . 5 6 on the left . 
I will keep you informed as to the status of Mr . Xuereb . 
My concern is that if he does infect this PTFE graft we do not have any suitable autogenous conduit to perform an additional reconstruction and he would stand a very high chance of losing his limb at the knee level . 
If I can be of any further assistance in the management of this or any of your other patients with vascular disease , particularly those in need of a minimally invasive vascular procedure , please feel free to contact me directly . 
Today , on physical examination , the wound bed measured 1 cm x 0 . 7 cm . 
The wound bed was covered with yellow biofilm , which was debrided . 
The underlying wound bed contained moist red tissue with a few drops of bloody drainage . 
The margin was clear . 
There has been no further disruption of the epithelium overlying the hypertrophic scar tissue . 
Mr . Xuereb will return to clinic in two weeks . 
And PVD . 
S / P LE bypass was admitted to Vascular service with 1 - 2 day history of RLE pain , discoloration . 
Found to have occluded fem - pop bypass . 
Underwent unsuccesfull attmp by IR to open vessel and was awainting sheath pull on the vascular floor when he developed shortness of breath and b / l chest pressure in the setting of FFP transfusion . 
Did have a troponin 0 . 6 and some anterior ST changes . 
He was diruesed and placed on CPAP when he began to increasing respiratory effort and evidence of tiring . 
He was then intubated and transferred to the CCU . 
On arrival in the CCU pt became hypotensive with MAPS in the 4 0 ' s . 
No EKG chages associated with these symptoms . 
Left arterial sheath . 
Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load . 
There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations . 
No definite ST elevations , but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand . 
As not lilely ACS , not emergent indication for cath , but he was scheduled for elective cath 1 2 / 0 8 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis . 
Pump - intubated , diruesis as allowed by pressure ( JVP up , some edema of CXR ) . 
Started on peripheral dopa , but this is at least partially related to sedation . 
Follow markers . 
Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3 vd and require CT surg consult . 
Have request FMC records . 
Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath . 
S / P LE bypass . 
Admitted to Vascular service with 1 - 2 day history of RLE pain , discoloration . 
Found to have occluded fem - pop bypass . 
Underwent unsuccesfull attmp by IR to open vessel and was awaiting sheath pull on the vascular floor when he developed shortness of breath and b / l chest pressure in the setting of FFP transfusion . 
Did have a troponin bump to 0 . 6 and some anterior ST changes . 
He was diuresed and placed on CPAP when he began to have increasing respiratory effort and evidence of tiring . 
He was then intubated and transferred to the CCU . 
On arrival in the CCU , pt became hypotensive with MAPS in the 4 0 ' s . 
He was startered on peripheral dopamine with good respone . 
No EKG chages associated with these symptoms . 
Please see admission H & P for initial exam and today ' s progress note for current exam . 
He was transferred to the CCU ( intubated ) but with diuresis he was weaned and extubated on 1 2 / 0 4 / 7 3 . 
He continued to be medically managed with ASA / Plavix ( on hold now for anticipated surgery ) , Statin ( lipitor 8 0 mg po qhs ) , BB ( lopressor 5 0 mg po q 6 h ) , and ACE - I ( captopril 6 . 2 5 mg po tid started on 1 2 / 0 5 / 7 3 ) . 
He is awaiting CABG but does not have good conduits as expected given his extensive PVD . 
Plastic surgery is evaluating patient for potential grafts . 
CNI pending pre - op . 
Pump : Patient was quickly weaned off all pressors . 
TTE was obtained on 1 2 / 0 5 / 7 3 . 
EF was 3 8 % , mild MR , LA dilatation , LV is dilated and fxn is moderately impaired ( inf / post / lat dysfunction ) . 
There were echodensities noted in the LV apex which may be trabeculations , however , thrombus cannot be excluded .

Limb is currently not threatened and he has dopplerable pulses . 
No plans now for interventions in LE . 
ID / WBC : WBC elevated on 1 2 / 0 5 / 7 3 but no fevers . 
May be due to steroids ( was receiving Dex while cort - stim was in process ) . 
This was discontinued .

Of note , she is a poor historian and is unsure of her medical issues or surgical plans . 
She had a pericardiocentesis performed six months ago which drained 1 L . 
She denies prior thoracic or major abdominal surgery . 
She was recently placed on coumadin for A - fib , she has held that for 2 days .

Brief Hospital Course : Ms [ * * Known lastname 1 0 1 5 6 2 * * ] was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery service on the day of her scheduled surgery , [ * * 2 1 1 5 - 5 - 1 5 * * ] . 
INR was checked that day ( 1 . 2 ) . 
She underwent left video assisted thoracoscopic surgery with pericardial window under Dr [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] . 
The surgery was uneventful and went as planned , but she remained intubated overnight given her very high oxygen requirement . 
She was transferred to the ICU intubated and an urgent pulmonology consult was requested . 
Our pulmonology colleagues agreed with us that she was retaining fluid leading to pulmonary edema so we removed all IV fluid and began diuresis with furosemide IV . 
She responded well and she was extubated in the afternoon of POD 1 . 
By POD 2 , she had resumed most of her home medications and was beginning a regular diet . 
Her Coumadin was resumed and pericardial drain was removed ( total output ) on POD 3 . 
She remained in the ICU until POD 4 , the primary indication being increased oxygen demand , requiring face tent most of the day . 
Chest x - rays and daily weights indicated she was no longer fluid overloaded , but her oxygenation continued to be poor . 
On the floor , we were unable to keep her oxygen saturation above 9 0 % with less than 4 L nasal canula . 
She reports this as her baseline pulmonary status , though denies being on home oxygen . 
She was seen and evaluated by physical therapy who initially recommended rehab due to risk of fall . 
She also required 4 L NC desaturating to 8 4 % on 2 L NC . 
Over the next few days she improved . 
Physical therapy re - evaluated her and deemed her safe for home with PT . 
While in house some mild confusion which improved over the course of her hospital stay . 
On discharge she was awake , alert , oriented and walked independently . 
Heme : Warfarin was restarted for atrial fibrillation and she will follow - up with her PCP [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 4 ) * * ] . 
By the time of discharge on [ * * 2 1 1 5 - 5 - 2 3 * * ] , she was tolerating a regular diet , voiding without difficulty , hemodynamically stable , taking her home medications and ambulating independently without oxygen , saturating 9 4 % RA . 
She was discharged to home with [ * * Location ( un ) 8 6 * * ] Care Group VNA and Physical therapy . 
She will follow - up with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] as an outpatient .

Moderate - large ascites , new from [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 1 0 - 3 * * ] . 
Nodular patchy opacities at lung bases , right > left , in bronchovascular distribution suggest aspiration 6 . 
Vicarious excretion of contrast via gallbladder and oral contrast in the large bowel suggest recent prior imaging , not at our institution . 
CT HEAD [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 6 - 9 * * ] 1 . 
No acute intracranial process 2 . 
Hypoattenuation in the bilateral periventricular white matter may be sequelae of chronic microvascular ischemic disease but has progressed from [ * * 2 1 7 3 * * ] and is greater than expected in this age group . 
EKG : [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 6 - 9 * * ] NSR , rate 6 9 , LVH , borderline LAD , inverted T waves in V - V 4 , biphasic T waves in V 5 . 
TTE [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 6 - 1 0 * * ] The left atrium is mildly dilated . 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2 D or color Doppler . 
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy . 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal . 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal . 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure ( PCWP > 1 8 mmHg ) . 
There is no ventricular septal defect . 
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied . 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal . 
The aortic arch is mildly dilated . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present . 
No aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened . 
There is no mitral valve prolapse . 
Mild ( 1 + ) mitral regurgitation is seen . 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is a very small pericardial effusion . 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade . 
Compared with the report of the prior study ( images unavailable for review ) of [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 1 - 7 * * ] , the degree of LVH is now moderate . 
There is now a very small pericardial effusion ( without tamponade ) . 
CXR [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 6 - 1 1 * * ] : Severe cardiomegaly is stable . 
There are low lung volumes . 
Pulmonary edema is mild - to - moderate , has worsened . 
Bilateral pleural effusions are small and new or newly apparent . 
RUQ US [ * * 2 1 7 8 - 6 - 1 1 * * ] : IMPRESSION : Initial four quadrant ultrasound did not demonstrate enough free fluid for paracentesis . 
This suggests that prior ascites may have shifted . 
Note is also made of sludge in the gallbladder with nonobstructive non - shadowing small stones . 
Previously visualized focal lesion at the liver dome is not visualized as no focal hepatic lesions are identified . 
Concerned for neoplastic and , chronic inflammatory , or infectious processes . 
He was given lasix 4 0 mg iv x 1 , and continued on a 2 0 mg iv daily regimen , then was transitioned to 4 0 mg PO daily . 
Daily weights and I / O ' s were followed . 
His blood pressure was controlled as below ; in particular , he was started on beta blocker , resumed on an ACEI ( which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy ) , and started on spironolactone as well . 
His O 2 requirement was weaned off . 
Nothing on history to suggest primary GI protein losing enteropathy though this should be considered ( i . e . 
SPEP / UPEP negative . 
Anti - TTG IgA negative . 
Pt should discuss need for colonoscopy with his PCP given anemia , weight loss and age . 
No subsequent cultures had growth . 
This likely explains reports of abdominal pain and diarrhea recently . 
Pt ' s abdominal pain resolved . 
He did not have diarrhea and stool studies were negative . 
Symptoms resolved and pt was tolerating a regular diet . 
Large DDx . 
Concerning for primary neoplastic vs . GI - infectious vs . GI / systemic infectious . 
See above . 
Nothing on history / exam to suggest primary rheumatologic disorder , ESR 1 3 , [ * * Doctor First Name * * ] negative . 
He was scheduled for a lymph node biopsy ( his R inguinal lymph node seemed the largest ) , excisional by surgery . 
However , he refused this . 
Contact [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] legal guardian [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( NamePattern 1 ) * * ] as well as PCP regarding this issue . 
Pt initially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes . 
However , later on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymph nodes was to look for " cancer " and then stated that he would never have a biospy . 
Discussed this with patient ' s PCP and legal guardian who did not want to force ( by physical or chemical restraint ) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will . 
Discussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple times and he did decline , but agrees to follow up with his PCP for further evaluation . 
Likely pre - renal , perhaps due to poor po intake . 
FENa suggested prerenal etiology . 
Creatinine improved to baseline . 
He should have chemistries / electrolytes followed after discharge . 
Creatinine on discharge 1 . 6 . . 
He was initially admitted to the ICU given his unresponsiveness after opiates . 
This resolved after being given narcan and never reoccurred . 
Smear was checked in ICU and only rare schistocytes were seen . 
HIV Ab was negative . 
His hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 3 0 . 1 on day of discharge without evidence of bleeding . 
This is likely due CKD . 
However , given recent abdominal pain and anemia pt should undergo a colonoscopy . 
His platelets were monitored and normalized . 
Splenomegaly not noted on imaging . 
HIV negative . 
Could have been due to medications or acute illness . 
Had not been tapped b / c ICU felt not tappable . 
No known chronic liver disease or cirrhosis . 
Considered lymphoma , occult cirrhosis , TB peritonitis on differential given + PPD , abdominal pain , weight loss . 
TB enteritis normal affects IC valve area which he does not radiographically / clinically have . 
RUQ US was without significant ascites , not enough to tap ; no cirrhosis noted . 
This could be due to heart failure , but is likely due to low albumin . 
Quantiferon gold PENDING at time of discharge . 
Given proteinuria , he was ( re - ) started on an ACE - I . 
He was also started on spironolactone given his heart failure and hypertension ( after drawing renin and aldosterone ) . 
He was started on beta blocker given dCHF . 
These are still PENDING at time of discharge . 
Repleted dialy . 
Pt started on spironolactone and still required supplementation of potassium . 
Suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by [ * * 2 - 8 * * ] given CKD and use of spironolactone . 
Pt should have his potassium checked regularly . 
Surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of LN , but pt refused . 
Pt refused on multiple occasions . 
See above . 
PCP and legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo procedures and testing that he did not want . 
Pt was aware that biopsy was suggested to r / o cancer . 
Mild per ECHO ( not large as reported on CT ) , no signs of tamponade . 
Other DDx = TB ( though usually much larger ) , other Rheum disorders ( unlikely by hx / exam ) . 
This was likely due to hypoalbumenemia . 
His potassium was repleted . 
QTC remained ~ 4 4 0 with haldol dosing . 
Serial EKG were performed . 
Pt ' s haldol dose was decreased to 5 mg from 1 0 mg due to this . 
EKG ' s should be monitored in outpatient setting . 
Would recommend outpatient workup for PFO , etc .

BY UPPER ENDOSCOPY IN 2 0 6 9 . 
BY UPPER ENDOSCOPY IN 2 0 6 9 . 
The myocardial perfusion scans show a moderate size , severe , fixed inferior and inferolateral defect indicative of prior infarct with little if any residual ischemia . 
BY UPPER ENDOSCOPY IN 2 0 6 9 . 
Coronary artery disease : ett 1 2 / 8 3 : The ECG response to pharmacological stress was nondiagnostic for ischemia . 
The myocardial perfusion scans show a moderate size , severe , fixed inferior and inferolateral defect indicative of prior infarct with little if any residual ischemia . 
Per her report she was reccently started on a new medication for her MG ( mestinon 3 0 mg QID ) earlier in the week . 
The week prior to her presentation her INR had been at goal of 2 . 0 , she then noticed blood in her stool and red blood on the paper towel . 
The next morning she was continuing to have blood on the toilet paper and noticed the toilet water was red tinged . 
She called her PCP who checked an INR which was elevated to 8 . 0 . 
She went to [ * * Hospital 3 6 3 5 * * ] hospital where crit was 2 9 . 0 and INR was 6 . 1 . 
She was given 2 U FFP , 5 of Vitamin K PO and transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
She got a CXR , was type and screened and cross matched for 2 units . 
Guiaic showed flecks of BRB , no active bleeding . 
GI was consulted who said they will evaluate her in the morning . 
Did go into Afib with RVR to the 1 6 0 s before being transferred to ICU and was transfused 2 units of pRBCs . 
On arrival to the MICU , patient ' s VS : 9 8 . 1 , 1 8 4 afib , 1 5 4 / 8 0 , 9 8 % 4 L NC . 
She was intially given 5 mg IV lopressor with immediate conversion to sinus rhythm . 
Past Medical History : - Afib on coumadin , diagnosed post operatively for a hip fracture in [ * * 2 0 9 9 - 2 - 7 * * ] . 
Not on cardiac meds , follows with Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 3 8 3 4 * * ] in Tuscon AZ for management of her coumadin . 
General : Alert , oriented , no acute distress , very thin and frail appearing . 
HEENT : Sclera anicteric , MMM , oropharynx clear , EOMI , PERRL , symmetric pstosis . 
Moderate - to - severe circumferential pericardial effusion is nonhemorrhagic . 
This study is not tailored to rule out tamponade . 
A cardiac son [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] is suggested . 
Ascending aorta is dilated up to 5 . 8 cm and its border is not well Preliminary Reportdefined . 
If clinical concern of acute aortic process remains , a C + exam is suggested . 
Bilateral moderate pleural effusion is more prominent on the left side . 
Portable TTE ( Complete ) Done [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 9 - 2 3 * * ] IMPRESSION : Low - normal left ventricular systolic function . 
Dilated aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitation . 
At least mild mitral regurgitation - diastolic mitral regurgitation is present , in keeping with severe aortic regurgitation . 
There is a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade . 
However , the RV wall looks hypertrophied , suggesting pulmonary hypertension ( signs of tamponade may be absent with elevated right sided pressures ) . 
Also , the presence of severe aortic regurgitation means that pulsus paradoxus is insensitive to assess inter - ventricular interaction . 
Compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 9 - 2 2 * * ] , the current study is more complete . 
The findings are probably unchanged . 
A tortuous aorta is seen with aortic arch calcifications . 
There is no pneumothorax and no focal lung consolidation . 
Vertebroplasty material is seen in the upper lumbar spine . 
Portable TTE ( Focused views ) Done [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 9 - 2 2 * * ] IMPRESSION : Suboptimal image quality . 
There is probably moderate / severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp . 
Mildly hypokinetic ventricular function . 
Moderate - sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade , although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial diastole , suggesting either low filling pressures or early tamponade . 
A bedside thoracentesis was to be performed , however on ultrasound the heart was noted to be close to the wall . 
A chest CT was done [ * * 9 - 2 2 * * ] which was remarkable for a small to moderate left effusion with a significant pericardial effusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm . 
An echo was performed [ * * 9 - 2 2 * * ] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade which showed probable moderate / severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp , moderate sized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade , although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrial diastole , suggesting either low filling pressures or early tamponade . 
A formal echo was performed on [ * * 9 - 2 3 * * ] dialted aortic root with probable small sinus of Valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton , a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade . 
Cardiology was consulted who recommended CT with contrast due to concern for dissection ; CT showed dissection of the thoracic ascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium . 
CT surgery was consulted who recomended surgery but the patient declined . 
She was medically managed with HR and blood pressure control but continued to decline over the next several days with increasing oxygen requirements eventually requiring 1 0 0 % on a non - rebreather . 
The patient and her family made the decision to be made comfort measures only on [ * * 9 - 2 7 * * ] . 
She was given morphine and she passed away with her family at her side on the morning of [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 9 - 2 8 * * ] . 
Coumadin was held in setting of GI bleed . 
She was given 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 and rates slowed to the 1 2 0 ' s . 
She then had a likely vagal episode and became acutely bradycardic with a 6 second pause . 
The episode resolved spontaneously and the patient reverted back to atrial fibrillation . 
The patient was transitioned to 2 5 mg metoprolol TID but remained in a - fib with rvr . 
She was placed intermitantly on diltizem drip and converted to NSR with rates in the 6 0 s . 
When the decision was made to make her CMO , these were discontinued . 
Her hematocrit dropped to 2 4 . 2 . 
She received 2 units pRBCs and had an appropriate rise in hematocrit . 
The INR was corrected with 2 units FFP and 5 mg vitamin K x 2 . 
Also on the differential diagnosis are hemorrhoids and malignancy . 
She did have a colonoscopy in [ * * 2 0 9 8 * * ] that did not show any polyps , making malignancy unlikely . 
The patient ' s hematocrit stabled and she had no further episodes of bleeding . 
Etiology likely multifactorial secondary to pericardial effusion and poor reserve with underlying myasthenia . 
The CXR did not show any evidence of acute infection . 
She was placed on nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation > 9 2 % . 
Please see above , but the patient had increasing oxygen requirments eventually requiring 1 0 0 % on a non - rebreather . 
At that time the patient made the decision to be made CMO . 
She had a positive anti - acetylchoine receptor antibody and was started on pyridostigmine with little improvement . 
She was recently starte on mestinon . 
Neurology was consulted regarding diagnosis and treatment and concern for underlying malignancy with paraneoplastic syndrome . 
They recommended monitoring vital capacity and negative inspiratory force . 
Neurology weighed in regarding possibe surgery and advised that the patient may have a slower recovery coming off of the vent . 
The patient and her family made the decision to be made comfort measures only on [ * * 9 - 2 7 * * ] . 
She was given morphine and she passed away with her family at her side on the morning of [ * * 2 1 0 0 - 9 - 2 8 * * ] .

Brief Hospital Course : Mr . [ * * Known lastname 7 0 8 6 * * ] is a 5 0 year old man with HIV , CAD , and HTN who presented with nausea , vomting , diarrhea , weakness , fevers , chills , pruritis and abdominal pain . 
He initially required pressors and IV fluids to support his blood pressure . 
The etiology of his SIRS was unclear as his infectious workup was largely negative with the exception of a potential LLL pneumonia . 
It was thought that this was most likely due to an anaphylactic reaction to amoxicillin as on further questioning he endorsed pruritis , facial erythema / edema , and that these symptoms felt quite similar to an anaphylactic exposure to bactrim he had several years ago . 
Regardless of the etiology he quickly improved in terms of hemodynamics and lactate level . 
He was continued on levofloxacin and given a prescription to complete a seven day course to finish on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] . 
A CT scan was negative for an infectious or inflammatory process . 
He still complained of slight nausea at discharge and was given a prescription for compazine to use as needed . 
At discharge his blood pressure was stable in the 1 1 0 - 1 5 0 / 5 0 - 8 0 range . 
At discharge he was restarted on atenolol at 2 5 mg daily . 
He has a follow - up appointment in [ * * Company 1 9 1 * * ] on [ * * 2 1 0 4 - 9 - 2 2 * * ] and at this time he should have his blood pressure checked and medications adjusted if needed ( he was previously taking metoprolol 5 0 mg and lisinopril 5 mg ) . 
He was continued on his aspirin .

Please see Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 2 7 3 5 7 * * ] operative note for full details . 
Postoperatively , the patient received a TAP block for pain in the PACU . 
She developed tachycardia to 1 3 0 s . 
Preoperatively , the patient had been tachycardic to 1 1 0 s . 
The patient had received 6 L IV fluids and maintained good UOP . 
She also received 1 3 mg IV morphine and RR went down to 8 . 
Arterial blood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pCO 2 to 5 9 . 
No pre - operative Hct was drawn , but the post - op HCT was 2 7 . 5 . 
Her 0 2 sat was 8 2 % on RA and up to mid 9 0 s on CPAP . 
The decision was made to transfer the patient to the [ * * Hospital Ward Name 3 3 2 * * ] ICU for further management . 
On arrival to the ICU the patient ' s 0 2 sat 9 9 % on 2 L , she was alert , oriented and RR 1 5 , not complaining of any pain .

The CXR was consistent with atelectasis . 
Patient also noted to have some snoring and full neck likely associated with some degree of sleep apnea . 
She was ruled out for pulmonary embolism with CT - A . 
At the time of [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] call - out , the patient was saturating 9 8 % on 2 L oxygen by nasal canula , which was stable from her presentation to the ICU , mildly improved . 
The patient clearly denied pain , anxiety ; her post - op pain was controlled with dilaudid PCA . 
She did describe some difficulty with bowel prep that could have caused dehydration , but the tachycardia did not resolve with 6 L IVFs despite orbital edema . 
Her post - operative fever could have been contributing to the tachycardia as well . 
Telemetry was discontinued upon transfer to the GYN oncology service . 
CTA was suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology . 
She was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU in addition to 2 units of pRBCs she had received intraoperatively in the PACU . 
The patient was transferred to the gyn oncology service on POD # 1 . 
Given that her temperature was still elevated to 1 0 1 . 2 at the time of transfer , she was started on IV clindamycin empirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia . 
Urine culture was negative , and blood cultures were still pending at the time of hospital discharge . 
Following initiation of clindamycin , she remained afebrile for over 2 4 hours . 
She then respiked to a low grade temperature of 1 0 0 . 6 . 
Urinalysis was negative . 
CXR was repeated , demonstrating bibasilar opacities concerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia . 
The patient spontaneously defervesced , and remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital stay . 
Clindamycin was discontinued and levofloxacin initiated . 
The patient received 2 4 hours of IV levofloxacin and was discharged home on po levofloxacin . 
Within 2 4 hours of discharge , the patient called informing that insurance would not cover po levofloxacin . 
She was switched to a 1 0 day course of augmentin and azithromycin . 
Diet was retracted from full liquids back to NPO with resolution of symptoms . 
Diet was successfully advanced the following day .

The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2 - 1 0 years ago appearance of symptoms . 
Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive . 
Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted , the fourth trigger release , which was performed in 2 0 6 2 as well . 
The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space . 
There is no locking or triggering , but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted . 
Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well . 
However , abductor pollicis brevis function is intact . 
Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand , but otherwise normal examination . 
In addition to this , I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers . 
It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study .

RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 . 
However , we can reduce the risk . 
These recommendations were shared with the patient , the nurse and the medical team . 
PROCEDURE : 1 . 
Tracheostomy . 
Gastrostomy . 
The head was positioned extended with shoulder roll placed . 
The tracheostomy incision was performed first with the remainder of the field isolated with an over drape . 
A vertical midline incision was formed in the neck between the cricoid and the sternal notch . 
This was infiltrated with 1 % lidocaine with epinephrine for improved hemostasis . 
The wound was taken down in the midline using cautery taking care to remain in the raphae . 
The anterior surface of the trachea was crossed at the first interspace by the thyroid isthmus . 
The isthmus was therefore isolated and suture ligated bilaterally with # 2 - 0 silk . 
It was then divided and the second and third tracheal rings exposed widely by dissection of the thyroid off of the trachea . 
At this time , stay sutures were placed into the trachea in the midline at the first and third rings with 3 - 0 Prolene . 
A trap door was scored with cautery and then the trachea was entered sharply with the endotracheal balloon deflated . 
The transverse incision at the second ring was used to visualize the endotracheal tube , which was then passed distally and further work was done with airway control above the balloon until we were ready for the exchange . 
At this time the remainder of the flap was cut using [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] scissors and hemostasis was obtained using cautery on the tracheal mucosa . 
At this time , a prelubricated # 8 Shiley tracheostomy was brought onto the field . 
The endotracheal tube was withdrawn under direct vision to above the tracheotomy site and the tracheostomy placed into the trachea uneventfully . 
CO 2 return was assured as was ventilation . 
The tracheostomy was sutured in place with 0 silk and then secured with umbilical tapes . 
The inferior portion of the tracheostomy wound was closed slightly with a single # 3 - 0 nylon . 
The superior stay suture was removed . 
The inferior stay in the flap was left in place and secured with a Tegaderm for access should there be an inadvertant removal . 
Procedure was terminated . 
Estimated blood loss was less than 5 cc . 
At this time , the neck wound was covered . 
The over drape was removed and attention was turned to the abdomen . 
A 6 to 8 cm incision was fashioned in the midline . 
The skin was incised sharply . 
Subcutaneous tissues were divided with the [ * * Last Name ( un ) 4 1 6 1 * * ] and traction . 
The linea [ * * Female First Name ( un ) * * ] was incised with cautery and the calciform ligament was visualized . 
This was swept to the right and the peritoneum was entered along the left margin of the falciform . 
The abdominal contents were visualized . 
The colon was identified clearly and swept inferiorly . 
The stomach was grasped with long Babcocks in left upper quadrant and delivered into the wound . 
At this time , 2 Babcocks were placed to hold the stomach up in the wound . 
Concentric 2 - 0 silk pursestring sutures were placed into the anterior wall of the stomach at the junction approximately of the antrum and the body . 
At this time [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] cautery was used to enter the stomach through the pursestrings . 
This wound was dilated slightly with a clamp and a # 2 4 Malecot catheter was passed into the stomach . 
At this time , the pursestrings were tied and the catheter was withdrawn through the abdominal wall approximately 6 cm to the left of the midline and 2 fingerbreadths below the costal margin . 
This was done by incising the skin generously and passing a Sarot clamp , antegrade into the abdomen and withdrawing the end of the Malecot catheter . 
At this time , the Malecot was withdrawn to bring the stomach snuggly up against the anterior abdominal wall . 
Just prior to withdrawing the catheter the final 2 cm , a 3 - 0 silk suture was placed into the posterior rectus sheath and the stomach to tack the stomach up to the abdominal wall . 
This was tied as the Malecot was withdrawn to have the stomach flushed with the posterior sheath . 
At this time , the Malecot catheter was secured in place on the skin with a # 2 - 0 nylon . 
The midline at this time was irrigated with copious normal saline and closed with a running # 0 PDS suture . 
Subcutaneous tissues were once more irrigated and hemostasis was assured . 
The skin was closed with staples . 
Dry sterile dressings were applied . 
The gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity drainage and will be maintained that way for 2 4 hours at which point the patient can be fed . 
Estimated blood loss was less than 5 cc . 
Patient tolerated both procedures without incident . 
Right groin was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion . 
Using sterile technique , local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance , the right common femoral vein was accessed and a vascular sheath for the delivery system of IVC filter was advanced into the inferior vena cava . 
The venogram was then performed demonstrating patent inferior vena cava , and the level of renal veins was identified to be at L 1 vertebral body . 
Based on radiologic findings , it was decided that the patient would benefit from placement of an IVC filter . 
The tip of the sheath was positioned in the infrarenal IVC at the level of L 1 under fluoroscopic guidance . 
The filter was then advanced into the sheath and placed into the infrarenal portion of the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance . 
The sheath was then removed and hemostasis was achieved after 1 0 minutes of manual compression . 
The patient tolerated the procedure well . 
There were no immediate complications . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
No evidence of intraluminal thrombus in the right common femoral vein , right iliac and IVC veins . 
IVC filter placed into infrarenal location . 
Brief Hospital Course : A / P : Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] is a 5 0 yo man w / rapidly progressing ALS who is status post tracheostomy , PEG , IVC filter placement with course complicated by peptic ulcer cauterization , and antibiotic treatment for S . aureus and B . fragilis bacteremia . 
At the time on the medical floor he had worsening secretions in his oropharynx requiring nasotracheal and oropharyngeal secretions with distress resulting in hypertension and tachycardia . 
A Scopolamine patch was placed and pt was admitted to the MICU on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 8 - 8 * * ] for more intensive monitoring and nursing care . 
He subsequently recovered , was extubated , and was called out to the floor on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 8 - 1 0 * * ] . 
The patient ' s respiratory status remained stable until late night on [ * * 8 - 2 1 * * ] . 
The pt had a sudden onset of SOB with diaphoresis , followed by hypotension . 
The MICU team was called . 
The pt ' s vitals at midnight were T 9 6 . 1 , BP 1 5 4 / 8 0 , HR 1 0 0 , RR 2 6 , O 2 8 3 % on 2 L NC . 
At this point the pt was placed on NRB . 
During this period the pt ' s family was contact [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] regarding his code status . 
He had been DNI only until the day prior when the pt and his family decided to allow for intubation for scheduled PEG placement [ * * 8 - 2 2 * * ] . 
Given this reversal of code status , clarification was warranted . 
Initially the pt ' s wife / hcp could not be reached . 
At 1 2 : 1 5 am the pt ' s vitals were BP 8 6 / 6 6 , HR 7 0 , RR 1 6 . 
ABG was done and showed 7 . 0 4 / 1 2 1 / 1 3 8 . 
The pt was placed on peripheral dopamine and given an amp of HCO 3 . 
A CXR was performed and did not show any acute pulmonary process . 
An EKG was without acute changes . 
The pt ' s wife was reached and affirmed that the pt was to be full code . 
The pt was intubated at around 1 2 : 3 0 am for hypercarbic respiratory failure . 
His dopamine was discontinued as his pressure stabilized . 
He was further supported hemodynamically with IVF boluses ( 1 . 5 L ) prior to arriving to the ICU . 
In ICU a R IJ TLC was placed and pt was bolused to maintain pressures . 
In the ICU , pt was stable and multiple attempts to wean him for extubation , but he was unable to maintain ventilatory status on his own . 
After much discussion with the family in conjunction with the palliative care team , the decision was made to place tracheostomy and gastric tube . 
After trach placement , attempts were made to place him on trach collar which he was only able to tolerate for short periods . 
He was fitted for a Passy - Muir Valve to allow him to speak with the trach . 
He has some endotracheal secretions for which he is treated with glycopyrrolate . 
He is currently vented with Vt 6 0 0 cc Respiratory rate : 1 4 PEEP : 5 cm / h 2 o FIO 2 : 4 0 % which he tolerates well . 
Pt ' s hematocrit dropped to 1 7 on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 9 - 9 * * ] . 
A abdominal CT was performed that showed no RP bleed but high - density material in the stomach , concerning for gastric hemorrhage . 
We attempted to draw a residual through his PEG , but it was obstructed , unable to infuse or withdraw . 
Hemolysis labs were not revealing . 
His stools then became guaiac positive during this time period . 
GI was consulted and performed an EGD which showed an ulceration at the PEG tube site that was cauterized . 
Surgery was consulted to reassess the PEG tube , and it was cleared with sodium bicarbonate tablet solution . 
He was maintained on [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] PPI . 
Anticoagulation was stopped and a retrievable IVC filter was placed on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 9 - 1 1 * * ] . 
His Hct was subsequently stable . 
He received a total of 5 U PRBC for this bleed . 
Throughout hospitalization PEG worked without difficulty . 
TSH wnl . 
Pain and anxiety were adressed with psych consult and starting mirtazapine in addition to his home sertraline . 
He denied any pain that might be contributing . 
He had an echocardiogram which showed hyperdynamic LV function . 
In discussion with cardiology , we believe that his tachycardia may result from autonomic instability resulting from his ALS . 
During the remainder of his hospitalization , his heart rate was controlled with low - dose metoprolol . 
WBC stable . 
Follow - up cultures are negative to date . 
Completed 1 4 - day course of vancomycin for coag - negative S . aureus , levofloxacin and metronidazole for B . fragilis . 
He was maintained on low dose wafarin while on levofloxacin and metronidazole . 
All anticoagulation was stopped on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 9 - 9 * * ] with his GI bleed . 
A retrievable IVC filter was placed on [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 9 - 1 1 * * ] . 
He had no EKG changes without a bump in his CK , so he likely had a reversible ischemic event in the context of sepsis , tachycardia , and intubation . 
He denied any CP at the time . 
His troponins trended down thereafter . 
Renal U / S ( [ * * 2 1 8 7 - 8 - 2 7 * * ] ) was negative for hydronephrosis . 
His UA showed urine eosinophils . 
His creatinine increase corresponded to his starting Zosyn , so Zosyn was stopped with slow resolution of his creatinine to baseline .

She was in her prior state of health until yesterday afternoon when she started noticing mild facial swelling . 
She went to bed and was doing fine , but when she woke up at the normal time she noticed worsening of her lip swelling to the point she was unable to open her mouth . 
She denies any wheezing , stridor , shortness of breath and states that has been on Lisinopril 2 0 mg for long time . 
She denies fever , chills , changes in her voice , drooling , neck pain , hoarseness or any other upper airway symptoms . 
Of note , patient was recently admitted for abdominal pain and negative work up including CT abdomen , right upper quadrant ultrasound , and HIDA scan were all performed and within normal limits . 
Diet was advanced without difficulty , and patient was placed on aggressive bowel regimen with daily bowel movement . 
She was discharged home 3 days ago . 
In the ER her initial VS were T 9 7 . 4 F , HR 5 8 BPM , BP 1 2 6 / 7 9 mmHg , RR 1 6 X ' , SpO 2 1 0 0 % on RA . 
She was breathing comfortably , but there was a lot of difficulty examining her mouth . 
ENT and anesthesia were called to assess patient . 
ENT tried scoping her to assess for vocal cord swelling , but she did not tolerate procedure secondarely to anxiety and dyscomfort . 
ER tried giving 5 mg of midazolam and re - doing procedure , but patient was still unable to tolerate it . 
Then , given patient ' s breathing being stable ENT decided to preoceed with medications only and observation for 1 hour in the ER . 
Pt received 1 2 5 mg of IV solumedrol , 2 0 mg of IV famotidine , 2 5 mg of IV diphenydramine and epipen x 2 ( its unclear if first one went in , so [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] repeated the dose ) . 
She was stable for 1 hour and then is admitted to the ICU for monitoring . 
She is has a tough access and ER could only get a small IV in R forearm ( that is why they gave epineprhine IM ) .

Initially patient was managed in the ICU and kept NPO / IVF and pain was treated . 
On [ * * 1 - 4 * * ] , patient was deemed stable to come to the floor after pancreatic labs and bilirubin began to trend down . 
Neuro : The patient was alert and oriented throughout his hospitalization ; In the ED , patient was given IV Dilaudid for pain with good effect . 
Upon transfer to the unit , fentanyl was started due to rash from Dilaudid . 
This seemed to control the patient ' s pain well . 
When patient transferred to floor , Pain service was consulted to control pain . 
They recommended Roxicet , which provided good relief for the patient . 
CV : The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint . 
Vital signs were routinely monitored . 
BP was slightly low in the ED with SBP in the high 9 0 , however this improved substantially with adequate hydration . 
Pulmonary : The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint ; vital signs were routinely monitored . 
Good pulmonary toilet , early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization . 
GI / GU / FEN : Patient was kept nothing by mouth with intravenous fluid upon admission to the hospital , but was advanced to stage 3 upon transfer to the general surgical [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] , which he tolerated without increased pain or nausea . 
CT scan was performed in the ED which showed acute uncomplicated pancreatitis and cholelithiasis , but no signs of cholecystitis . 
Large ventral hernia was also seen on CT scan . 
Labs were trended throughout hospital course , which showed continuous drop in pancreatic enzymes . 
However bilirubin continued to rise with a peak total bilirubin of 4 . 4 on HD . 
ERCP was consulted , but they were unable to perform the procedure due to patient ' s altered anatomy from bypass surgery . 
MRCP on [ * * 1 - 3 * * ] showed no intra or extrahepatic dilation , and no stone was seen . 
Bilirubin and other labs continued to trend down and patient was transferred to the floor on [ * * 1 - 4 * * ] .

Hypotension and Fever : There was immediate concern for sepsis on presentation to the ED , although no apparent source was isolated and no significant fever was recorded in the hospital ( had 1 0 0 . 4 on admission to the ED ) . 
Sepsis workup was negative including CXR , UA , Urine and Blood cultures . 
Final blood cutlure results are still pending . 
Given recent craniotomy the neurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for CNS infection . 
A RUQ ultraound was performed that confirmed a moderate amount of ascites and patency of the hepatic vessels , but the abdomen was not tender and the suspicion for SBP was low . 
Adrenal insuficiency was ruled out per cosyntropin test . 
The patient did receive a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in the ED but none were continued in the ICU as the patient remained afebrile and the ICU team ' s suspicion for infectious process was low . 
The patient recieved a dose of IV steroids in the ED and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of Prednisone 6 0 mg . 
Dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for his presentation , especially given the acute renal failure and associated morbilliform rash , as a type IV drug reaction , including DRESS , though no eosinophilia was noted on differential . 
Adittionally patient had recently been started on Keflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins is another possibility . 
Both dilantin and Keflex were discontinued and should be avoided in the future . 
The patient remained afebrile and normotensive during his ICU stay and the day after admission was transferred to the oncology service . 
He remained stable on the oncology floor and is now discharged back to rehab facility .

He sought evaluation from his PCP 3 weeks ago was and found to have severe cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 2 5 % on stress - MIBI . 
There was global hypokinesis . 
Perfusion images suggest a small distal anteroapical scar and moderately dilated LV ( both new since 2 0 7 6 ) . 
There was no definite evidence of ischemia , although it is noted the patient was unable to achieve 8 5 % MPHR due to poor activity tolerance . 
He was started on Coreg , as well as Lasix which has been uptitrated from 2 0 to 6 0 mg qd , with subsequent 1 2 - 1 4 lbs weight loss .

He received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline EKG , exercise tolerance test , and Myoview study . 
The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT , which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue . 
On the Myoview study , a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal . 
Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 6 2 % . 
A subsequent exercise echo was normal . 
Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 1 6 0 / 6 8 with systolic pressures noted as high as 1 8 0 . 
His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 1 4 8 / 8 0 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August . 
Hemoglobin A 1 C in 2 1 4 7 was 6 . 2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet . 
He was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in October 2 1 4 8 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart . 
Mr . Eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain , once in the morning and once in the evening . 
These episodes lasted only 1 - 2 minutes , and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout . 
The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin , which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout . 
His course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission . 
He was awakened near 3 am by 8 / 1 0 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw . 
Associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath , sweating , nausea or vomiting , headache , lightheadedness , fever , or vision changes . 
The pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors , prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to BBH ED from his Cheney home . 
Review of systems was positive for polyuria , increased thirst , mild non - productive cough , post - nasal drip , and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months . 
The patient denies recent or past history of edema , GERD , claudication , clots , hemoptysis , hematemesis , dyspnea on exertion , orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , wheezing , fatigue , appetite or weight changes , or night sweats . 
In the emergency department , the patient was given aspirin , lopressor , sublingual nitroglycerin , and 2 L O 2 by nasal cannula , and chest pain subsequently resolved . 
EKG on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy . 
A chest x - ray was negative for pneumonia or acute CHF and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum . 
CT scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection . 
Cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative , but D - dimer was elevated at 8 1 6 . 
Stool sample was guiac positive , although CBC was stable with HCT 4 4 . 6 . 
Also hearing changes , dizziness , sore throat , neck stiffness , palpitations , dysphagia , diarrhea , constipation , melena , hematachezia , dysuria , hematuria , weakness , leg swelling , easy bruising , bleeding from gums , epistaxis , heat / cold intolerance , changes in mood or sleep habits .

CN II - XII intact . 
Motor and sensory exams unremarkable . 
Subsegmental atelectasis involving the right lower lung . 
No evidence of aortic dissection . 
Choelithiasis without cholecystitis . 
Punctate calcification in the left kidney , without evidence for hydroureteralnephrosis , likely vascular , though renal calculus is possible . 
The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia , myocardial infarction , aortic dissection , pneumothorax , pulmonary embolus , bronchitis , pleurisy , GERD / esophageal spasm , musculoskeletal / chest wall pain , and anxiety . 
The sudden onset of severe chest pain , awaking him from sleep , raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI , aortic dissection , or PE . 
The patient has elevated D - Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings ( dyspnea , pleuritic chest pain , cough , hemoptysis , tachypnea , signs of DVT ) or CT / CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism . 
In addition , he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection , including syncope , pulse deficits , and new murmur . 
The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin . 
Moreover , the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago , and has multiple cardiac risk factors . 
This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis . 
EKG changes lacked ST segment elevation , although T - wave inversions were present in some leads . 
The patient may have either a non - ST elevation MI or unstable angina . 
The plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and EKG changes , with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow . 
Cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan . 
Otherwise exercise - MIBI in AM . 
In brief , the pt is a 6 7 M w HTN gout and DM who woke up at 3 am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms . 
He did feel slightly SOB but there was no N , V , diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time . 
The episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin . 
Upon further questioning , he thinks he had two similar episodes last week . 
He has not had any DOE , PND , or LE edema . 
He does not know the details of the workup . 
Of note the pt does not smoke , is not on ASA , and has several family members with CAD but no men < 5 5 or women < 6 5 . 
In the ED , he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro . 
HR was 8 5 and BP 1 3 5 / 8 2 . 
He was given ASA and a BB . 
Initially , his EKG was read as normal but later the T waves became biphasic in leads V 4 - 6 . 
Repeat EKGs when he was chest pain free , showed flipped Ts in V 4 - 6 . 
There were no old EKGs available for comparison . 
He was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + ( Hct 4 4 ) . 
A dissection protocol CT was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central PE . 
His first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation . 
On exam , he was in NAD and was CP free . 
Heart was RRR , lungs CTAB and he had no lower extremity edema . 
ASA and BB were cont . 
The third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test . 
However , the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead . 
This is planned for this morning . 
Please note this pt is allergic to Allopurinol . 
On the morning of admission , patient developed more severe chest pain and pressure radiating to both arms and back . 
Pain persisted for 2 hours , prompting the patient to present to the BBH ED for further care . 
In the ED , patient was treated with ASA , metoprolol , sl NTG , and chest pain resolved . 
EKGs showed biphasic T - waves in V 4 - 5 . 
CT scan was negative for aortic dissection or other acute pathology . 
Cardiac markers were negative . 
Patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for further management . 
Of note , at Pennsylvania Hospital , patient had a positive ETTMIBI showing fixed + mild reversible defect in the inferoapical region in 2 / 4 7 , followed up with normal exercise echo in 5 / 4 7 . 
On first night of admission , patient developed recurrent chest pain when going to the bathroom . 
Because of his risk factors for disease , the decision was made to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization . 
In the cath lab , patient was found to have multivessel CAD with an LAD culprit . 
He received 3 xCypher stents to the mid and distal LAD with residual flow limitation . 
RCA with moderate disease . 
LCx with distal disease . 
Patient was transferred to the SDU for further care . He was started on beta - blockers and ace - inhibition , and tolerated these medications well . 
He was evaluated for cardiac rehab . 
Of note , patient was informed of the pulmonary nodule located on CT scan and the need for follow - up CT in 3 months . 
JVP no jugular venous distention . 
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 and S 2 , with no S 3 or S 4 . 
There were no murmurs , clicks or rubs . 
PRWP and NSSTTWA . 
He has moderate multivessel CAD and was treated w / Cypher stent x 3 to the severe stenoses in his mid and distal LAD . 
His followup stress test was negative for ischemia and he has an appt at cardiac rehab on 3 / 2 9 . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
Pulmonary nodule . 
Hypertension . 
Coronary artery disease . 
He underwent cystoscopy , selective cytologies , bilateral retrograde pyeloureterogram , left ureteroscopy , laser lithotripsy , stone extraction , stent , and bladder biopsies on 9 / 2 7 / 5 0 . 
Post - operatively he experienced urinary retention and a catheter was placed without difficulty . 
He was advised he could safely return home , but he was sleepy and his wife expressed distress over looking after the catheter . 
He was therefore admitted . 
No history of urinary tract infections and previous stones . 
Scans were continued into the pelvis to evaluate the ureters .

She noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning , and she felt as if she may need to eat something . 
However , because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment , she decided not to eat . 
She continued to feel poorly ( she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled ) . 
She saw a police cruiser , and walked over to it with the intention of getting help . 
When she arrived , there was no one in the car , and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car . 
This is the last thing she remembered ; when she awoke , she was surrounded by people . 
She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head . 
When EMS found her , she was confused , making repetitive statements , and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck . 
When she arrived at the FMH ED , her blood pressure was 2 1 3 / 9 7 HR 8 4 RR 2 0 O 2 sat 9 9 % RA Temp 9 7 . 3 .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : 1 . 
Hypertension . 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease . 
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : 1 . 
Atenolol 1 0 0 mg p . o . 
Zestril 5 mg p . o . 
Prilosec 2 0 mg p . o . 
Celexa 2 0 mg p . o . 
Rocaltrol one tablet p . o . 
Renagel 3 2 0 0 mg p . o . 
The patient tolerated the procedure well and had a postoperative course that was significant for delayed graft function . 
His hospital course is summarized as follows by systems : 1 . 
When the patient was tolerating p . o . 
Once the patient began ambulating and using his incentive spirometer , he no longer needed supplemental oxygen , saturating 9 5 % on room air . 
Back on postoperative day one , the patient was noted to have a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to around 9 0 , coincident with a decrease in his urine output . 
The patient was given fluid boluses but his pressure continued to decline , reaching a nadir of 7 4 systolic . 
The decision was made to transfer the patient to the SICU for closer monitoring of his volume status using his CBP . 
Once in the Unit , the patient ' s systolic pressure increased to the low 1 0 0 ' s . 
He was started on a renal dose Dopamine drip . 
It was believed that his episode of hypotension coincident with some shaking chills , was secondary to a gamma globulin reaction . 
His gamma globulin was subsequently discontinued and he remained in the SICU until postoperative day four . 
At that time , the patient ' s systolic pressures were back up into the 1 4 0 s to 1 5 0 s and he was making good urine . 
He was subsequently discharged to the Floor where his pressures remained in the normal range throughout the remainder of his hospital stay . 
He had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath throughout the hospital stay . 
He was on a bowel regimen of Colace and Dulcolax suppositories p . r . n . 
He had a bowel movement on postoperative day three . 
However , coincident with his episode of hypotension on the morning of postoperative day one , his potassium had risen to 7 . 2 and his creatinine had jumped up to 1 2 . 6 . 
Once in the SICU , the Renal Team decided to dialyze the patient . 
He underwent one treatment of hemodialysis . 
His creatinine dropped to 8 . 7 with a potassium of 5 . 6 . 
Over the next couple of days , his creatinine rose to level off at a level of approximately 1 0 . 0 . 
There it remained for the remainder of his hospital stay . 
While he was in the Intensive Care Unit he was receiving 8 0 mg of intravenous Lasix twice daily to maintain his urine output . 
After transferring to the Floor and maintaining an output of approximately 2 5 0 cc an hour , his intravenous fluids were discontinued on postoperative day five . 
On postoperative day six , his intravenous Lasix was discontinued and the patient continued to have an adequate urine output . 
At the time of discharge , he still remained approximately 1 2 liters positive from his preoperative dry weight . 
It was noted that the patient had some unilateral swelling of his right arm concerning for a thrombosis secondary to the right IJ central venous line . 
On the [ * * 2 - 2 4 * * ] , a right upper extremity ultrasound was performed that demonstrated widely patent venous outflow with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion . 
It was felt that the unilateral swelling was secondary to the patient ' s positive fluid status combined with poor venous outflow secondary to his right AV fistula . 
After it was believed that the patient was having a reaction to Thymoglobulin , he received a dose of 1 0 0 mg of Zenapax on [ * * 2 - 2 2 * * ] . 
The Thymoglobulin was discontinued and he was loaded on Rapamune . 
The patient received a second dose of Zenapax four days after the first dose . 
Rapamune levels were sent after the third dose and are pending at the time of this dictation . 
The patient ' s white count has levelled off at around 5 to 6 , 0 0 0 . 
The patient ' s Foley catheter was removed on postoperative day five and had absolutely no trouble voiding . 
His [ * * Location ( un ) 1 6 6 1 * * ] - [ * * Location ( un ) 1 6 6 2 * * ] drain continued to put out greater than 3 0 cc over a 2 4 hour period , and therefore , the patient will be discharged home with the [ * * Location ( un ) 1 6 6 1 * * ] - [ * * Location ( un ) 1 6 6 2 * * ] in place .

Gout . 
It sounds like this is really not much of a problem when he remembers to take the Colchicine . 
I encouraged him to make this a regular habit . 
We will check a random uric acid level . 
Cardiac risk factors . 
He is a male with a very positive family history who is a smoker . 
He has significant cardiac risk factors . 
We spent a long time talking about smoking today . 
At his request I gave him a prescription for Nicoderm patches . 
He will start at 2 1 mg for six weeks and then move to 1 4 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mg for 2 weeks . 
We will check a cholesterol and he should be less than 2 0 0 given his risk factors . 
I pointed out to him his evidence by history of chronic bronchitis and of peripheral vascular disease . 
I think he found this sobering . 
General health . 
We discussed exercise , cholesterol and seat belts . 
We also discussed the use of Q - Tips which I think may also be a significant contributing factor to his decreased hearing and the impaction of cerumen . 
I recommended ear drops . 
We can have him tested formally when he becomes interested in intervention . 
Xzavior C . Welch , M . D . 
Unfortunately , he arrived 2 4 hours late . 
He is gradually recovering from a recent flare of his COPD .

We will have him check his peak flows at the same time every day . 
When he is feeling well his peak flows are always in the 3 5 0 range and he reports that they never go to 3 0 0 . 
When it hits 3 0 0 he should call me or if it is the weekend , he should start immediately on prednisone 4 0 mg a day .

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr . Gregg ' s care . 
He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot . 
He was admitted to the vascular service on 8 / 0 9 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off . 
His pre - operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years . 
He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory . 
His LV was normal with EF of 5 9 % . 
He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis . 
There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX . 
He had been asymptomatic . 
The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty . 
There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall . 
He tolerated this well . 
Returns today feeling well and has been active painting his fence and going up and down stairs without any chest pains or unusual SOB .

EEG [ * * 1 0 - 1 7 * * ] Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the moderately severe suppression of the background throughout . 
The background was slow , and it was intermittent , alternating with much lower voltage patterns . 
There was a brief episode of some " lightening , " but the background remained encephalopathic throughout . 
Medication effect is probably the most common cause of such recordings . 
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing , but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings . 
There were no epileptiform features .

OSH CT showed pancreatitis and concern for pancreatic necrosis . 
EtOH pancreatitis is the most likely etiology . 
She underwent MRCP at our hospital which demonstrated hemorrhagic , necrotic pancreatitis . 
Patient was managed conservatively with aggressive fluid replacement . 
A surgery consult was obtained and did not advise any operative or IR procedures for the peripancreatic inflammation . 
She subsequently developed acute lung injury , bilat pleural effusions , anasarca , and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis . 
Her course was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well . 
She also showed altered mental status during her ICU stay related to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy . 
Patient required insulin replacement therapy while she was in the unit and on the floor . 
She was then transferred from the ICU to the floor . 
There , she had PT / OT , blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagic pancreatitis , and diuresis . 
Before transfer to rehab she was noted to have significant and had CXR . 
This showed possible loculated left upper lobe effusion . 
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [ * * 2 1 6 4 - 1 1 - 2 * * ] which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion . 
Case was discussed with interventional pulmonary service and given the patient ' s improving clinical status and lack of active evidence of infection , they recommended not performing a paracentesis to evaluate the loculated effusion . 
The patient was educated to return if she develops fevers , rigors , sweats , worsening difficulty breathing . 
Head imaging was negative ( CT and MRI ) including EEG . 
She is back to normal mental functioning after her prolonged and complicated course . 
She was initially on Vancomycin and imipenem . 
Vancomycin d / ced ( [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 8 2 0 1 0 * * ] ) . 
CT chest on [ * * 1 0 - 2 6 * * ] was concerning for worsening multifocal pneumonia , so her antibiotics were changed from Imipenem to Vanco / Zosyn . 
Microbiology data has been negative since [ * * 1 0 - 1 7 * * ] . 
Cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearing device . 
Before transfer to rehab she was noted to have significant and had CXR . 
This showed possible loculated left upper lobe effusion . 
She underwent repeat CT of the chest on [ * * 2 1 6 4 - 1 1 - 2 * * ] which showed left anterior loculated effusion . 
Patient was extubated again [ * * 1 0 - 2 5 * * ] . 
CT chest showed interstitial changes and pleural effusions .

The patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea with a 3 0 - pound weight gain and decreased urine output . 
She was noted to have an INR of 1 9 . 5 on admission . 
She was given vitamin K and admitted to the Fennard Intensive Care Unit for concern for gastrointestinal bleed . 
The patient was also found to have nephrotic range proteinuria and elevated LFTs . 
Echocardiogram revealed depression in her ejection fraction to 2 0 percent . 
GI Service was consulted and it suspected that her increasing liver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injury with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension . 
The Renal Service was consulted and felt her creatinine increase and proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabetic nephropathy with severe right - sided heart failure . 
She was initially started on Lasix for her uncompensated congestive heart failure , but her creatinine rose , so she was transferred to the [ * * Hospital Ward Name 5 1 7 * * ] to initiate nesiritide treatment .

Chest x - ray on [ * * 4 - 7 * * ] , shows congestive heart failure versus bibasilar atelectasis . 
Renal ultrasound shows unremarkable left kidney , limited evaluation of the left . 
No hydronephrosis . 
Normal echo texture . 
Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction of 2 0 percent , severe global left ventricular hypokinesis , severe global right ventricular and free wall hypokinesis , 3 plus TR , mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
Abdominal ultrasound shows normal liver echo texture , hepatopetal portal venous flow . 
The patient had mild elevation in her cardiac enzymes , more consistent with atrial fibrillation and hypotension in the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] . 
These enzymes trended down and were not consistent with myocardial infarction . 
The patient was felt to be at risk for arrhythmia secondary to her severe congestive heart failure and would likely need pacemaker replacement in the future . 
She was started on a Natrecor drip due to her worsening renal function with Lasix . 
She was diuresed well with the Natrecor and the Congestive Heart Failure Service followed her while she was in the hospital . 
After several days of Natrecor diuresis , she was transitioned to Lasix , although her creatinine rose to 2 . 1 and therefore her Lasix was held for 1 day and her Lasix dose was decreased . 
She was started on dofetilide per the Electrophysiology Service in an attempt to convert her to sinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure . 
The patient did convert to sinus rhythm on dofetilide , although her creatinine was unstable and rose to 2 . 1 . 
Therefore , dofetilide was considered to be a poor antiarrhythmic choice for her . 
Per the Electrophysiology Service , there were no other antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need to follow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablation is unsuccessful , likely AV node ablation with pacemaker placement . 
The patient ' s creatinine during her hospitalization rose to 2 . 1 and her Lasix dose was subsequently decreased . 
Because of her unstable creatinine dofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her . 
Her hepatitis A virus IgG was positive , although all other hepatitis serologies were negative . 
Acetaminophen level was negative . 
This was felt to be either related to transient hypotension in the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] versus hepatic congestion from congestive heart failure . 
During her hospitalization , her LFTs improved . 
She was continued on her Paxil and during her hospitalization denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations . 
She will continue on this as an outpatient and follow up with her neurologist .

She was concerned that her dyspnea was related to her lungs and I believe self referred to Janesville for further evaluation . 
She was found by cardiac echo there to have significant decrease in her ejection fraction to 1 5 % . 
Previously here last fall her ejection fraction measured 4 3 % . 
She had global hypokinesis . 
She was hospitalized at Janesville and had an abnormal set of pulmonary function tests showing moderate restrictive disease . 
She had some air trapping and was noted to have room air saturation 9 7 % at rest , 9 4 % with exertion . 
Lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT . 
BNP elevated at 5 0 0 . 
VQ scan showed possible perfusion defect in the left lower lobe . 
Previous CTA in the emergency room had been negative for pulmonary embolus . 
Because of continued suspicion about PE she underwent pulmonary arterogram which was unremarkable . 
A repeat VQ scan after a normal PA gram showed some persistence in the left lower lobe defect and ultimately it was felt that she did not have evidence of any thromboembolic pulmonary vascular disease . 
Of note pulmonary artery pressure was approximately 5 0 at the time of PA gram . 
The patient was commenced on Lasix 2 0 mg . 
Her Atenolol was changed to Toprol . 
She would much prefer cardiac echo and if there is improvement , continued medical therapy . 
She has retired . 
Daughter is finished with college and Quarry Worker in the Bristow area . 
Denies edema , PND , orthopnea . 
Still has dyspnea with walking flat ground but not until 1 - 2 blocks . 
No significant murmurs . 
PMI normal . 
Her evaluation at Janesville Clinic for thromboembolic pulmonary disease was unremarkable . 
She was found to have a markedly positive ANA at 1 - 1 2 8 0 with a speckled pattern and single stranded DNA postive . 
Further markers etc are not available to me at this time . 
At this point , repeat cardiac echo at our institution will be obtained . 
Depending upon the results I will again approach the patient regarding considering Cardiac catheterization although in truth her pattern in LV dysfunction is more suggestive of recurrent myocarditis / undetermined cardiomyopathy than coronary disease . 
In addition , the patient relates that she stopped Lipitor due to myalgia and that she is taking a differrent cholesterol tablet at this time although once again she unable to name the medication . 
She relates that she will call our office . 
She was well before going to bed on 1 2 / 0 9 / 9 8 . 
In the morning of 1 2 / 1 0 , her husband noticed that she was repeating the same word & # 8 2 2 0 ; lawyer & # 8 2 2 1 ; and the rest of her speech was garbled . 
Patient subsequently states that she had word - finding difficulties , but denies comprehension problem . 
There was no other neurologic complaint per husband . 
Of note , she has similar presentation a few years ago . 
Over the course of today , her speech has improved but still not back to normal . 
General review of systems was negative for fevers , chills , rashes , change in weight , energy level or appetite , chest pain , palpitations , shortness of breath , cough , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , bleeding diathesis , and change in bowel or bladder habits ( i . e incontinence ) . 
There is no history of smoking , excessive ETOH intake or illicit drug use . 
No tremor , rigidity , or bradykinesia . 
No pronator drift . 
No evidence of extinction . 
Stable chronic infarct involving the left frontal lobe . 
No aneurysm is visualized . 
CT confirms infarct in left frontal lobe , age - undetermined . 
The distal right intradural vertebral artery occlusion is likely chronic and incidental finding . 
He says the blood has been alternately dark black and bright red , but that the BRBPR has slowed significantly and he has not had any bowel movements all day today . 
His abdominal distension is much better and he is passing gas from below , but his lower abdominal pain is unchanged . 
He had a CT scan at [ * * Hospital 1 3 4 * * ] which revealed diverticular disease , gastrohepatic lymph nodes , and subcentimeter hepatic cysts , as well as gastric distension and moderate splenomegaly . 
He then had an EGD which demonstrated a mass at the GE junction that was actively bleeding . 
His hematocrit was 5 0 on presentation , then drifted down to 2 7 last night . 
After a unit of blood his repeat hematocrit was 2 6 , at which point he received two more units of blood . 
His Hct is now 3 0 . 
Drinks 2 - 3 beers / day followed by [ * * 1 - 2 3 * * ] glasses of wine . 
No RDA . 
Used to work as a salesman but now retired . 
Lives alone . 
Admission labs were notable for a Hct of 5 4 . 4 with WBC of 2 2 . 5 . 
During his brief hospital course his Hct continued to drop ( to a low of 2 6 ) warranting a total of 3 PRBC transfusions . 
The patient was evaluated by both the Oncology and Gastroenterology teams and a upper endoscopy was performed on hospital day 1 - notable for a large bleeding mass located in the GE junction . 
Biopsies were performed and given the high concern for malignancy the patient was prepared for transfer to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] SICU for further management . 
Here , he was found to be hemodynamically stable . 
His hematocrit dropped from 3 0 . 9 on [ * * 6 - 1 9 * * ] to 2 4 . 7 on [ * * 6 - 2 1 * * ] , so he was transfused a unit of pRBCs . 
His hematocrit stabilized and he was transferred to the floor . 
On [ * * 6 - 2 2 * * ] , he underwent a colonoscopy to evaluate for a lower GI bleed given his initial presentation . 
The colonoscopy showed dark melenic - appearing stool in the whole colon and terminal ileum , non - bleeding diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon , non - bleeding internal hemorrhoids , and otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum . 
He tolerated the procedure well . 
On [ * * 6 - 2 3 * * ] , the foley was discontinued , but the patient failed to void and required reinsertion . 
Also , an endoscopic ultrasound was attempted but failed due to patient agitation . 
The patient apparently had an undocumented drug side effect of the lorazepam , which resulted in two code purples being called . 
Throughout the entire time , the patients vital signs were within normal limits and stable , including oxygen saturation ( once the measurement was obtainable - originally the patient was refusing pulse ox ) . 
The patient was discharged on [ * * 6 - 2 4 * * ] in stable condition with a leg bag in place . 
His daughter declined our offer to schedule him with a nearby urologist to follow up on the leg bag because they live in [ * * Location ( un ) 5 0 8 7 * * ] . 
She was informed that it is very important , therefore , that he follow up with his PCP quickly to get a referral to a urologist in Hindham to manage the leg bag .

Leroy X . Oshea , M . D . 
Over the past two weeks , he can no longer walk more than a block , whereas in the past he could walk & gt ; 1 0 0 yards ( and per his daughter , as far as he wanted ) . 
He states that at night he wakes up short of breath and has to dangle his feet off the side of the bed , when he noticed they were quite swollen . 
Additionally , he has trouble lying on his back , and has to either lay on his side or prop himself up , which is new . 
He does not report any chest pain , or history of MI . 
He has had a cough x 1 - 2 weeks as well . 
In the ED his intial vitals were AF 1 1 4 / 9 2 1 1 7 1 8 9 9 % RA and he received Tylenol , albuterol , atrovent , a one liter bolus , and furosemide 2 0 IV x 2 , 1 2 5 mg IV solumedrol , and his BNP returned at 1 0 , 7 6 5 . 
He had a CXR showing cardiomegally and pulmonary edema . 
Hypertension . 
Iron deficiency anemia . 
Thyroid nodule . 
Pulmonary nodule . 
No HSM . 
No masses , rebound . 
Cardiomegaly . 
Given his exam , I would favor systolic heart failure & gt ; diastolic heart failure , although he has features going for both . 
Features going for systolic are his widely displaced PMI and the fact that he had a mildly dilated LV on an echo in 2 0 9 2 . 
I think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2 / 2 mitral regurgitation , which was moderate to severe in 2 0 9 2 . 
His murmur is quite impressive . 
Another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy . 
Ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors . 
He is also a smoker . 
Another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes . 
CHF & # 8 2 1 1 ; Still quite volume overloaded on exam .

Will start statin and check fasting lipid panel in am . 
Restless leg syndrome & # 8 2 1 1 ; Likely 2 / 2 iron deficiency anemia . 
Iron deficiency anemia & # 8 2 1 1 ; Will start iron sulfate , recheck ferritin . 
He was afebrile at 9 6 . 7 . 
Heart was regular rhythm , no murmurs . 
His alcohol level was 2 7 7 . 
We did give him a p . o . 
We also treated him with multivitamins . 
Depression . 
Hyponatremia . 
These medications were discontinued and as stated previously , the patient was started on Phenytoin for prophylaxis . 
He was initially diagnosed with HSV 1 meningitis on [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 4 - 2 3 * * ] . 
He presented after he was in an accident while driving from RI to VT , rented a second car , and was in a second accident , at which point he was brought to an outside hospital and eventually diagnosed with HSV meningitis . 
He was started on a course of IV acyclovir , and discharged to [ * * Hospital 3 8 * * ] rehab . 
His rehab course was complicated by a lower extremity DVT , for which he was started on Coumadin , however on [ * * 5 - 1 5 * * ] there was concern that the clot was mobile , and on [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 5 - 1 6 * * ] he had an IVC filter placed . 
Around this time he became febrile to 1 0 2 . 6 , and on [ * * 5 - 1 8 * * ] was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for fever and worsening confusion . 
He was admitted from [ * * Date range ( 1 ) 6 6 3 7 5 * * ] , during which time he underwent a repeat LP , which showed 5 6 WBCs and a protein of 8 3 , but was HSV negative . 
He had blood and urine cultures that were also negative . 
His fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir , though his mental status continued to fluctuate , and he was sent back to rehab on [ * * 5 - 2 1 * * ] . 
His sister continued to visit him , and reports that even as recently as two days ago he was actually starting to improve . 
At his best he was reported to be communicative , with a slightly strange affect , and mild short term memory and executive function impairment . 
However , on [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] he was noted to be very unsteady with PT , and was found to be orthostatic as low of SBP of 6 0 when standing , and it was recommended that he start both fludrocortisone and midodrine . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 7 * * ] the patient was noted to be forcibly keeping his right eye closed , and also was felt to be more apraxic with worsening coordination . 
He was also felt to not be moving his right arm as frequently . 
For all of this he was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further evaluation .

White matter signal changes could reflect two seizure episodes . 
Stable encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe and enhancement along the right mesial temporal lobes and right frontal [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 5 2 * * ] matter . 
No new intracranial abnormality . 
Brief Hospital Course : NEURO : SEIZURES : On initial EEG , he was thought to be in complex partial status , and was given a trial of ativan with electrographic and clinical improvement . 
He was increased on his Keppra from 5 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] to 1 5 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
He continued to have frequent R temporal complex partial seizures , characterized by focal rhythmic theta activity . 
Clinically , the seizures were characterized by L hand twitching movements , R facial twitching , and confusion . 
On [ * * 5 - 2 9 * * ] , He was loaded on phosphenytoin and started on maintenance dosing with improvement in seizure frequency . 
On [ * * 6 - 1 * * ] , he was loaded on vimpat 2 0 0 mg IV , and started on maintenance of 1 0 0 mg [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
Patient had a very complicated course with many antiepileptic medications trialed . 
He was initially transferred to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory distress . 
His seizures were controlled with midazolam , then he was switched to propofol because midazolam was not providing sufficient sedation , and this was also effective in suppressing seizures . 
He then began having frequent nonconvulsive seizures , and was started on phenobarbital [ * * 6 - 6 * * ] , and Depakote on [ * * 6 - 9 * * ] . 
He underwent trach and PEG [ * * 6 - 1 1 * * ] . 
Zonisamide and Topamax were also tried . 
He temporarily was able to be transferred to the neurology step down unit , but returned to the ICU for midazolam drip on [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 7 - 4 * * ] . 
Nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained refractory . 
The seizures continued to originate from bilateral temporal lobes despite increasing serum levels of Dilantin ( corrected 2 0 - 2 5 ) and phenobarbital ( 9 0 - 1 0 0 ) and midazolam drip . 
HSV ENCEPHALITIS : Patient had severe HSV encephalitis resulting in necrosis and cystic changes in bilateral temporal lobes . 
Serial MRIs also showed development of extensive vasogenic edema in bilateral cortices . 
There was concern for ADEM process , and patient was treated with 5 days high dose steroids . 
Repeat MRI did show improvement in the diffuse edema after steroids . 
Another repeat MRI done several days after stopping steroids appeared stable with no further improvement but no worsening . 
It was impossible to determine if the steroids would have improved his mental status , this the timing coincided with worsening of his seizures and starting midazolam drip . 
On [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 7 - 2 1 * * ] , a family meeting was held with the epilepsy team , palliative care , and the SICU team . 
It was decided that the patient would not want to go on with his current quality of life . 
It was then decided to make the patient comfort - measures - only with continuation of the antiepileptics and to pursue extubation on Friday [ * * 7 - 2 3 * * ] . 
The patient maintained off of intubation for several hours but ultimately passed away Friday night . 
ID : 1 . 
HSV ENCEPHALITIS - ID was consulted on admission . 
Patient has completed 2 2 1 day courses of acyclovir . 
Repeat CSF HSV PCR was negative x 2 . 
He underwent thorough workup for other coexisting viral infections which was negative ( HIV , CMV , EBV , VZV , HTLV 1 , [ * * Male First Name ( un ) 2 3 2 6 * * ] virus ) . 
HIV viral load was also negative , so patient could not possibly be in the " window period " of acute infection . 
HSV culture was also negative from the CSF , so there was no evidence that the type of HSV was resistant to acyclovir , and thus no additional antiviral treatment was warranted . 
Brain biopsy was discussed several times throughout his course , but ultimately decided that there would be no diagnostic or therapeutic advantage from this . 
FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN - Patient developed fever to 1 0 2 daily . 
He was initially treated with empiric course of vanco / zosyn but fevers persisted with no clear source and all cultures negative . 
ID ultimately thought this was either drug or central fever . 
He did also develop a mild maculopapular rash and elevated eosinophil count , which point toward drug fever . 
His seizure medications were likely culprit , but could not be stopped due to nonconvulsive status . 
The rash improved on its own and the fevers continued until discharge . 
LYMPHOPENIA / LOW CD 4 COUNT Patient developed lymphopenia and low CD 4 count ( 2 1 2 on [ * * 7 - 5 * * ] ) . 
This caused concern for HIV , but HIV antibodies and viral load were negative . 
Other possible causes such as CMV and HTLV 1 were also negative . 
This may be due to chronic illness and bone marrow suppression from HSV infection . 
UTI Urine culture from [ * * 7 - 9 * * ] grew > 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 E coli , treated with ceftriaxone . 
PNA Sputum culture from [ * * 7 - 9 * * ] grew Klebsiella , treated with ceftriaxone . 
GI : TRANAMINITIS - Patient had normal LFTs on admission but developed elevation in AST / ALT to 3 0 0 - 4 0 0 with no elevated bilirubin but with elevated ammonia . 
This was likely a medication side effect , and improved with stopping Depakote . 
There was then a second episode of LFT elevation that resolved with stopping zonisamide . 
HEME : 1 . 
However , on [ * * 5 - 1 5 * * ] there was concern that the clot was mobile , and on [ * * 2 1 9 0 - 5 - 1 6 * * ] he had an IVC filter placed . 
He was treated with therapeutic doses of Lovenox during this hospitalization , since coumadin was interacting with AEDs . 
Anemia Hematocrit gradually trended down during admission from 3 3 at admission to 2 5 . 
Hematology was consulted . 
There was no evidence of hemolysis or any other acute concerning process on peripheral smear . 
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency so he was started on ferrous sulfate daily . 
There was also likely contribution of bone marrow suppression from medications . 
RENAL : Acute kidney injury - likely due to acyclovir and hypotension on sedation and AEDs . 
Resolved . 
The patient denies any associated history of weakness , parasthesias , diplopia / blurry vision , loss of visual field , hearing loss / tinnitus , vertigo , nausea / vomiting .

She was discharged from NGH to rehab on 1 / 8 / 2 0 7 5 after ORIF of a right humeral fracture . 
She feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab . 
On the evening prior to admission , however , she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving Ativan from her nurse . 
She then was able to fall asleep but woke - up at 2 AM with diaphoresis and SOB . 
She denied chest pain . 
She was attended to and her BP was 2 2 0 / 1 1 7 . 
She was given 2 SL NTG , O 2 , and Lasix , after which her SOB somewhat improved but her HTN continued . 
She also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white / yellow sputum . 
She denies missed medications , changes in diet , adding salt to meals ( although she is at rehab and her diet order is unclear ) . 
At this time , she denies CP , SOB . 
Exam was notable for tachycardia , rales at the apices , use of accessory muscles , and LE edema . 
Labs were notable for elevated WBC and BNP , non - infected U / A , and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR . 
She produced 7 0 0 cc urine . 
Upon d / c from the ED , BP was 1 5 7 / 7 2 and O 2 sat was 1 0 0 % on 2 L . 
LENIs were pending .

Carotids are 2 + bilaterally without bruits . 
Normal S 1 , S 2 . 
No wheeze . 
No paraspinal tenderness . 
No CVA tenderness . 
Active BS . 
Oriented to person , place , time . 
CN II - XII grossly intact . 
Sensation grossly intact to light touch and vibration . 
There is increasing prominence of the interstitium and peribronchial cuffing when compared to the prior study consistent with interval development of CHF . 
Surgical clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax . 
No definite focal consolidation is demonstrated . 
The hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study . 
This could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of CHF , but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid . 
IMPRESSION : Findings consistent with CHF . 
Bilateral LENIs : NO EVIDENCE OF FEMORAL OR POPLITEAL DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS OF EITHER LEG . 
EKG : Normal sinus rhythm at 9 5 . 
Normal axis . 
Normal PR , QRS , QT intervals . 
No ST elevations or depressions . 
Q waves in v 1 , v 2 , v 3 but also may be upslopes before the downslops . 
Her exam and imaging is consistent with pulmonary edema , as she has had in the past . 
The precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear , however . 
She describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive . 
It is possible that HTN 2 / 2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab , ischemia , increases renin - aldo , or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema . 
Conversely , however , CHF may have precipitated her HTN .

FINAL SENSITIVITIES . 
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD ( S ) . 
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD ( S ) . 
She p / w acute onset SOB in the setting of one week of dyspnea and fatigue , which was initially concerning for PE . 
Further w / u ended up ruling out PE , and her SOB was likely in the context of her fever and GNR bacteremia , which were likely [ * * 3 - 8 * * ] urinary source . 
ACTIVE ISSUES : . 
She did not undergo CTA due to elevated Cr , but was started on a heparin gtt in the ED . 
Upon admission to [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] , she had no Si / Sx of hemodynamic or respiratory collapse . 
ACS , PNA or pulmonary edema were r / o . 
LENIs were obtained , which were negative . 
A VQ scan was subsequently performed , and it was low probability for PE and the heparin was d / c ' d . 
In the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] her SOB vastly improved without further intervention . 
Her dyspnea was most likely due to her anemia as she significantly improved after transfusion of 2 units pRBCs for a HCT of 1 8 . . 
Pt has a h / o b / l hydronephrosis [ * * 3 - 8 * * ] ureter obstruction requiring left ureteral stent and right nephrostomy tube , and all UA ' s have been positive with pyuria and hematuria since [ * * 2 - 1 5 * * ] . 
Upon admission , she again had positive UA ' s from both foley and nephrostomy tube . 
She received vanc / cefepime in the ED ; her past urine Cx ' s have grown E coli sensitive to cefepime . 
Per past urology notes , her R kidney is not functioning as well as the left , and no other urological interventions were necessary ; she is scheduled for a left stent change in [ * * 7 - 1 7 * * ] . 
While in the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] , GNRs grew out of her blood Cx from [ * * 6 - 1 6 * * ] , and she was continued on cefepime ( d 1 = [ * * 6 - 1 6 * * ] ) , and continued on vanc ( d 1 = [ * * 6 - 1 6 * * ] ) given that she has a port . 
Her urine culture grew coag + staph and per Urology , it was recommended to continue treating the UTI w / o indication for stent removal at this time . 
Her urine culture eventually speciated as pansensitive staphylococcus aureus , and she was transitioned to oral augmentin to compelte a total 1 4 day course following discharge . 
Her blood cultures speciated as pansensitive E . coli and she was transitined to oral ciprofloxacin , also to complete a 1 4 day course , priro to dishcarge . 
She remained afebrile and stable on oral antibiotics for 2 4 hours prior to discharge . 
Likely prerenal etiology given fever and UTI and FeNa of 0 . 9 % . 
She has a h / o obstruction , but had been maintaining good UOP from urethra and nephrostomy . 
Her Cr improved in the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] to 1 . 4 after 2 units pRBCs , and subsequently improved further to 1 . 2 by the time of discharge . 
She had no Si / Sx of active bleeding upon admission , although the pt endorses small amts of blood in stool while on avastin , known to heme - onc . 
She had a 6 - point Hct drop after admission to the [ * * Hospital Unit Name 1 5 3 * * ] with no identified source ; her Hct bumped appropriately after 2 U PRBC ' s . 
Her stool was guaiac negative . 
CHRONIC OR INACTIVE ISSUES : . 
Once her creatinine decreased to 1 . 4 , her home lisinopril was re - started .

We planned to treat this vessel with PTA and atherectomy . 
Heparin was given for anticoagulation . 
Access was obtained in an antegrade fashion of the RCFA and a 7 French Arrow sheath was advanced to the mid SFA . 
The AT was crossed with great difficulties with numerous wires , including PT [ * * Name ( NI ) 9 1 6 5 * * ] , [ * * Name ( NI ) 9 1 6 6 * * ] and Shinobi . 
However , attempts to cross the distal lesion with atherectomy or angioplasty devices failed . 
Finally , a 2 . 0 x 2 0 mm Maverick crossed the lesion , which was dilated at 1 2 Atm . 
Next , a 2 . 5 x 2 0 mm Quantum Maverick balloon was used to dilate the entire AT at 1 2 - 2 2 Atm . 
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis with flow to the foot through the PA and AT . 
The patient left the lab in stable condition .

Transferred to the CCU for further care . 
As mentioned in the HPI , she was transfused 2 units of PRBCs in the cath lab , and was transfused an additional unit in the CCU . 
She was also given IVF . 
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay in the CCU , without need for pressors , and her HCT also remained stable following the 3 units of PRBCs . 
Coumadin was held in the setting of her RP bleed , to be restarted as an outpatient . 
Aspirin was resumed on [ * * 2 1 2 5 - 1 - 2 5 * * ] and well tolerated . 
Her hematocrit was 3 1 . 1 at discharge . 
Pedal pulses were present via Doppler . 
She will follow - up with Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] in the week following discharge . 
She was continued on Lipitor . 
Aspirin , Atenolol , Diovan , and Lisinopril were gradually resumed in hospital following the procedure .

Discharge Instructions : Please call Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] or return to the hospital if you experience bleeding , weakness , dizziness , shortness of breath , chest pain , groin , abdomen or back pain . 
Dr . [ * * Name ( NI ) 3 1 0 1 * * ] office will call you Monday for an appointment next week . 
Stop taking your Coumadin until Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] tells you to resume it . 
Followup Instructions : See Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] in one week . 
His office will call you Monday . 
He now has occasionally tingling in his feet and hands , which is possibly similar to before or less so . 
He also has some posterior neck tingling , probably related to some position or activity and with lifting weight . 
He has no weakness in any extremities . 
His nocturia has decreased from three to one . 
The trembles , which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same , still a little worse on the left hand than the right . 
His weight is up to 2 3 0 pounds . 
He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout . 
His abdomen is entirely negative , so is his incision . 
Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression , I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months . 
Dr . Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him , which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are . 
Dr . Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure . 
Patient reports that he began having pain at the R sternal border , no radiation 4 - 5 days ago . 
Patient unsure when pain initially began . 
Initially lasting for minutes . 
Pain came and went without any correlation with activity . 
Episodes increased in frequency and intensity over the days . 
Exercise did not worsen his pain and was able to climb 2 - 3 flights of stairs without exacerbation of symptoms . 
Pain has been increasing in intensity over the past 4 - 5 days . 
Pain became unbearable and patient finally presented to BRA . 
Evaluated by BRA Cardiologist and transferred to CCH CCU for further workup . 
EOMI . 
At the time of this stenting , he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals . 
He presented with recurrent CP in May , and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent . 
This admission he had a 1 0 - 1 5 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring . 
The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins . 
He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin . 
In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT > 1 5 0 , he had one episode , moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding . 
Since transfer , still on heparin , he had no further bleeding , nor guiac positive stool until today . 
This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative . 
Following this , after returning to bed , he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum . 
He had no abdominal pain . 
No further bleeding since this morning . 
He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix . 
His colonoscopy in 2 0 6 6 revealed diverticulosis . 
He is currently on aspirin , plavix , heparin with therapeutic PTT . 
Per renal note also has pulmonary nodules , which are presumably metastatic RCC , but patient states prior eval not consistent with met disease . 
FH : no pertinent FH . 
No hepatomegaly . 
This bleeding was minimal and self - limited , most likely of hemorrhoidal origin , rather than diverticular . 
He does have some risk of recurrent rectal bleeding on these blood thinners , but the bleeding is likely to continue to be limited . 
There is no contraindication to cardiac catherization or continuing these important medications . 
There is also no intervention we could do now to adjust the risk . 
Would recommend proceeding to cardiac catherization . 
No alteration in medications required . 
Opal Larson , M . D . 
He has diffuse disease , otherwise with good collateralization . 
His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance , but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia . 
His Duke ETT score was - 1 0 , but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly . 
He had infero - apical hypokinesis with an EF of 4 5 % . 
It is also noted that his blood pressure fell , but normalized during exercise . 
The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly . 
He has no chest squeezing , neck squeezing , or jaw pain , but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth . 
He correlates this with exercise , but not consistently . 
He also occasionally feels this at rest . 
He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 9 0 . 
He is working doing heavy labor in the garden , moving , and digging . 
It is not clear that this represents angina , but we will let Dr . Null know . 
He is seeing Dr . Null in three to four weeks . 
The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2 0 7 0 . 
He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 1 7 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue . 
He has no chest pain or palpitations . 
He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 5 0 mg BID may be too much . 
He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 5 0 . 
He has no symptoms of forgetfulness , dizziness , or loss of consciousness . 
He does have cold extremities . 
There is no weight gain , weight loss , or orthopnea . 
He remains on beta blocker , lipitor , Diovan , hydrochlorothiazide , digoxin , and warfarin . 
He is no longer on Plavix . 
He has no nitrate . 
On exam , he is somewhat hypertensive , but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP . 
A : Stable . 
P : Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today . 
He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors . 
I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health . 
It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today . 
He has been fasting for 1 2 hours . 
He is not fatigued or pale . 
These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six - month intervals . 
He is quite reassured by this . 
He has several atypical - looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs . 
I have referred him to Dermatology today . 
I have reinforced the wisdom of taking some nasal steroid at HS . 
He continues to interest himself in equities trading . 
He states he is not as active as prior to his CABG . 
He denies depression .

Blood pressure could be better controlled . 
This patient with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH . 
She has been doing well except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for the past week . 
There is no history of cough , dyspnea , or chest pain . 
She denies any dysuria , urgency , or frequency . 
Her blood sugars at home have been between 1 2 0 and 1 8 0 . 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals , Erythropoietin , Premarin and Provera , Nephrox 1 5 0 mg tid , insulin NPH 1 0 units qam . 
On July 1 7 , after hemodialysis , Ms . Tinsley was given a partial dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus . 
CBC at the time revealed a white count of 6 . 2 with a hematocrit of 2 5 . 2 . 
Blood cultures were sent . 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 1 1 0 / 6 0 and a pulse of 8 8 . 
She was afebrile . 
Head and neck examination was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA . 
On cardiovascular examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no peripheral edema . 
Heart sounds were normal . 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3 + protein and 2 + glucose . 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center . 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection . 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary tract infection . 
Because of her early satiety she has been eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 1 0 mg qid . 
Vincent Ventura , M . D . 
Her chief symptomatic complaint is severe pruritus , which has not improved much with Benadryl . 
She has yet to fill the prescription for Sarna lotion . 
Her diarrhea has improved with Imodium , and she brought in samples for cultures today . 
Her appetite has improved somewhat . 
She notes exertional fatigue and shortness of breath . 
On examination , weight was 4 6 . 8 kilos , which is stable . 
Heart rate was 7 2 , blood pressure 1 3 0 / 6 4 . 
JVP was clearly seen at 6 cm greater than the sternal angle , and there was 1 plus peripheral edema . 
There was no S 3 . 
Chest examination revealed bibasilar inspiratory crackles . 
Her left hand is no longer cold , but the PTFE graft remains slightly edematous . 
Blood work from May 3 0 th showed a hematocrit of 2 3 , potassium 5 . 2 , bicarbonate 1 5 , BUN 9 1 , creatinine 7 . 9 , calcium 5 . 5 . , phosphate 5 . 2 , albumin 3 . 4 . 
We will continue to hold off on dialysis until such time as Peggy ' s PTFE graft is suitable . 
This will save her the additional morbidity of a semipermanent IJ catheter . 
She is more hypervolemic than last week , and I added Zaroxolyn 2 . 5 mg in the morning to her diuretic regimen . 
By oversight , she was not started on Rocaltrol , and I have started her on Rocaltrol . 2 5 mcg p . o . 
Page 2 Vincent Ventura , M . D . 
In summary , she is a 4 6 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic since the age of 2 9 and has been on hemodialysis since 2 0 8 3 . 
By report , her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy , peripheral neuropathy , and peripheral vascular disease . 
In viewing her present history , she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department . 
Her three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated . 
These episodes are relieved by nitroglycerin . 
Mrs . Tinsley has also noted that with walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved by slowing down . 
In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present only pre - dialysis , she has been and continues to be a smoker . 
Her cholesterol by one report was 2 2 8 mg / dl . 
I don ' t have fractionations and her family history is unknown . 
A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2 0 8 3 , shows mild ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency , preserved LV size and function . 
She had an exercise tolerance test in February of 2 0 8 5 . 
On a modified protocol , she went for less than 4 1 / 2 minutes . 
This is equivalent to not even completing stage 1 of the standard Bruce . 
With that , she did develop chest pain and had 2 mm of ST depression . 
That study was accompanied by both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum consistent with prior non - transmural infarct with exercise induced ischemia . 
As was apparent to those involved , even the non - isotope portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization . 
That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time , I only have the report . 
However , from this report , there was preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies . 
Coronary angiography showed by report , diffuse involvement of proximal mid - LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 8 0 % mid - LAD . 
The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal . 
The right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete stenosis . 
At that time , the recommendation was to continue medical therapy . 
Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with prempro 2 . 5 mg once a day , tenormin 2 5 mg qd , aspirin one every other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins , iron and twice daily insulin therapy . 
In rounding out her medical history , her surgical procedures have involved the hemodialysis access . 
She has had one pregnancy 2 8 years ago without complications . 
I also elicited a history of some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech . 
This was difficult to pin down , but is of some concern . 
Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left arm . 
There was a right carotid bruit , neck veins were not distended . 
Lungs were clear , PMI was displaced and sustained . 
There was an S 4 , no S 3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the apex . 
Abdomen was benign , femoral pulses were intact , extremities were without edema . 
The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm , diffuse STT changes . 
There were no pathologic Q waves . 
Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for transplant candidacy , I am concerned about her current cardiac status . 
She is a young diabetic woman , symptomatic of both shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test , has limited functional capacity . 
The coronary angiography reveals a presence of multi - vessel disease . 
Even without seeing the primary data which I hope to do in the next week , it would be unlikely that she would be an angioplasty candidate , given the poor results in diabetics . 
Obviously , I would like to review the films first , and speak with Dr . Upson regarding augmentation of her anti - anginals . 
I would also like to add pravastatin at this time , starting with only 1 0 mg and obtain non - invasive studies of the carotids . 
As indicated , although the focus of this evaluation was her suitability for transplantation , the issue of controlling symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more pressing . 
I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in her care . 
She also complains of pleuritic chest pain and a cough . 
Her other vital signs are stable . 
Her O 2 sat is 9 6 % on room air . 
Her exam is as noted in the written chart . 
Of note , on her cardiovascular exam : She has a regular rate and rhythm with a 2 / 6 systolic murmur . 
The lungs show left lower lobe crackles . 
Chest x - ray shows an infiltrate in the superior segment of the left upper lobe . 
Condition on admission is satisfactory . 
Otherwise her airway is patent . 
Her lungs are clear . 
No rebound , guarding , or rigidity . 
The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable . 
BUN is 1 6 . 9 with creatinine 2 . 8 . 
Elevated BUN and creatinine . 
She denies any other complaints . 
Condition on discharge stable . 
At catheterization she had a proximal 6 0 % lesion in her RCA as well as a mid 6 0 - 7 0 % RCA lesion , obtuse marginal lesion of 6 0 % , and an LAD mid lesion of 6 0 % . 
At the time it was decided to continue medical therapy on Ms . Levine . 
Since her cardiac catheterization approximately two weeks ago , she has had no recurrent symptoms of chest pain . 
She continues on her medicines including Lopid 5 0 0 mg b . i . d . , atenolol , aspirin , and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed , as well as her oral hypoglycemic medicines . 
Her vital signs are stable . 
Lungs are clear to auscultation . 
Cardiac exam reveals regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 and S 2 ; no murmurs , rubs or gallops . 
She has no peripheral edema . 
Electrocardiogram shows a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 7 0 , axis of about 4 6 , and there are no acute ST - T changes noted . 
She has three - vessel coronary artery disease , non - obstructive in nature . 
As long as she remains asymptomatic on her current medical regimen , we will continue to follow her . 
She will return for a follow - up visit in approximately three months . 
Quinn Ivey , M . D . 
His note reflects our joint assessment and plan . 
She had an exercise test in 2 0 7 6 for some vague symptoms , which was positive , and led to cardiac catheterization . 
This catheterization revealed 6 0 % LAD lesion , 5 0 % first marginal , 6 0 % RCA , and a 7 0 % diagonal lesion . 
She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms . 
She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic . 
She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion . 
She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol . 
She achieved 9 3 % of age - predicted maximal heart rate . 
At 4 minutes , she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort . 
She is a vague historian , but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms . 
She has no jugular venous distention . 
Her carotids are 2 + . 
Her heart shows normal S 1 and S 2 .

Long , M . D . 
I had the pleasure of seeing her on November 1 6 , 2 0 9 2 . 
Please allow me to summarize her history for our records . 
Ms . Vincent is a 5 6 - year - old mother of eight with chronic renal failure of unknown etiology . 
She is six years status post hysterectomy for endometriosis during which an occult leiomyosarcoma was discovered . 
She has an extensive history of hidradenitis , obesity , and hypertension . 
She had one stillborn infant , one premature infant , and three spontaneous abortions . 
SFOC records are unavailable at this time . 
Her medications include Premarin 0 . 6 2 5 qd , Diltiazem 2 4 0 qd , furosemide 4 0 mg qd , Mevacor 2 0 mg qd , Calcitriol 0 . 2 5 mcg qd , Niferex 3 0 0 mg qd , Vitamin E 4 0 0 units qd , fish oil qd , and Keflex 2 5 0 mg qid . 
On physical examination Ms . Vincent is a 5 6 - year - old woman in no distress . 
Her weight is 1 0 1 . 5 kilograms , or 2 2 3 lbs . 
Temperature is normal . 
Pulse is 8 8 beats per minute . 
Blood pressure is 1 7 8 / 9 6 . 
There is striking hirsutism and moon facies . 
There is a buffalo hump . 
The lungs show scattered wheezing . 
Cardiovascular exam is normal . 
There are discolorations of the skin across the neck , upper extremities , and trunk which are hyperpigmented but not raised . 
The abdomen is obese without palpable masses . 
There is a ventral hernia deep in the lower part of the abdomen . 
The extremities show trace edema . 
There are several areas of superficial petechiae . 
In summary , this 5 6 - year - old woman has chronic renal failure of unclear etiology . 
She does report an episode of lower extremity swelling in association with an episode of hidradenitis . 
Other diagnostic possibilities include other forms of chronic glomerulonephritis including systemic lupus erythematosus given the history of spontaneous abortions . 
Nevertheless , I agree that kidney biopsy is not indicated at this time given the advanced nature of her disease and the increased risk due to her body habitus . 
I discussed several options in renal replacement therapy with Ms . Vincent . 
Although she has no medical conditions which would preclude living - related or cadaveric kidney transplantation , her obesity and glucose intolerance along with the history of hidradenitis make transplantation a less attractive option . 
I have encouraged Ms . Vincent to attempt a gradual weight loss program in order to improve her fitness prior to either dialysis or transplantation . 
Nevertheless , her appearance is quite reminiscent of Cushing ' s disease , and this should be worked up if it has not been performed previously . 
I have arranged an iothalamate GFR to more closely approximate her kidney function and a follow - up appointment in two months ' time to meet with Helen Uren and consider creation of a native AV fistula or placement of a graft . 
Thank you once again for your kind referral . 
S . Quenton Jolley , M . D . 
We will not repeat her history as you know it well . 
Over the past three months Mrs . Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue , occasionally sleeping more than 1 2 hours per night , forgetfulness and tingling of the fingers and toes . 
She has maintained a relatively good appetite and denies nausea , vomiting or shortness of breath . 
An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 1 4 , 2 0 9 2 revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 1 0 ml per minute , suggesting profound loss of renal function . 
On physical examination today her weight is 9 9 . 5 kilograms or 2 1 9 pounds . 
Blood pressure is 1 5 0 / 9 0 , pulse is 8 0 and regular . 
The lungs are clear . 
There is no peripheral edema . 
Again , there marked cushingoid features . 
Despite overall weight loss , Mrs . Vincent comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as facial hair over the past several months . 
In summary , Mrs . Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of uremia . 
Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start dialysis within the next several months . 
We have arranged to recheck her chemistries today . 
We would also recommend that she undergo repeat work up for her cushingoid features . 
Although renal failure may alter hormonal balance and may promote occasional androgenic features in woman , this is beyond ordinary . 
Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in her care .

For his pre - operative work - up , the patient had a stress PET exam on 3 / 2 6 that was notable for a medium - sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior and inferolateral walls that was reversible . 
As a result , the patient was referred to Dr . Carroll who saw the patient in clinic on 3 / 2 7 . 
Given the patient ' s risk factors and positive stress test , the patient was scheduled for right and left heart catheterization on the day of admission with the plan to delay his hip surgery if he requires a stent and subsequent Plavix therapy . 
On the evening prior to his catheterization , he had dialysis . 
The patient went to the cath lab where he was found to have an 8 0 % lesion of the mid - RCA so a bare - metal stent was placed . 
After cath , the patient was started on ASA 3 2 5 mg PO daily and Plavix loaded with 6 0 0 mg PO x 1 then 7 5 mg PO daily thereafter .

Brief Hospital Course : 3 8 yo type I diabetic with gastroparesis presents with chronic sx . 
Pt c / o chest pain and found to have significant esophagitis . 
Then with acute renal failure after cardiac catheterization to further characterize chest pain ( no significant CAD ) . 
Cr returned towards baseline . 
Compliance with treatment plan and appointments continues to be challenging and although patient frustrated with his long hospital stay , he does not take active role in his health care . 
DKA : The patient originally presented with hyperglycemia . 
No evidence of ketones or acidosis . 
He did have an anion gap with closed quickly with IVFs and insulin gtt . 
He was quickly transitioned to SQ insulin . 
There was no evidence of infection . 
His blood sugars were difficult to control throughout his hosptital stay in part because he was frequently NPO for proceedures . 
He was followed by the [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] diabetes consult service . 
He was treated with NPH and a gentle SSI . 
Discharging him with NPH and a sliding scale was discussed , but the patient noted that he was legally blind and only able to read his Innolet disc and would not be able to draw up syringes . 
He will f / u with [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] . 
Hypoglycemia / Hypothermia : after receiving full insulin dose while NPO and undergoing stress test , the patient experienced an episode of hypoglycemia , confusion , diaphoresis , hypothermia to 9 1 . 9 and sinus bradycardia . 
He was transferred briefly to the ICU for monitoring , but once his glucose was corrected , the other issues also resolved shortly thereafter . 
He was transferred back to the floor the following day . 
He was started on RTC antiemetics and pain control as needed . 
He was transitioned from IV to PO dilauded . 
It was difficult to assess his abd pain as it was both LUQ , epigastric and substernal and radiated to the left shoulder . 
CT abd in the ED showed a thickend esophagus . 
He was evaluated with an EGD which showed severe esophagitis , gastritis and a soft food bezoar all of which were though to be due to gastroparesis and reflux . 
His antacid regimen was increased to PPI [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] . 
He was also placed on a liquid diet to facilitate the resolution of the bezoar and improve his gastroparesis . 
H . pylori serology was negative . 
Pathology showed . . . Per GI consult recomendation , erythmocyin was stopped as PO erythromycin has no effect on gastroparesis and as IV erythromycin has limited effect due to tachyphylaxis . 
In addition , there was a concern for risk of prolonged QT when he became bradycardic . 
Chest Pain : In the ED , a CT was negative for dissection . 
He was ruled out by cardiac enzymes . 
He was seen by cardiology on the floor who felt that given his numerous risk factors he should have a stress test . 
Given his baseline abnormal EKG a stress MIBI was performed , during which he had chest pain - although he had CP prior , during and after the test as well . 
At level of exercise achieved ( only 3 7 % of age - predicted maximum ) , there were no myocardial perfusion defects , however , depressed LVEF ( 3 8 % ) and global hypokinesis . 
He then received a dobutamine echo . 
The patient received intravenous dobutamine beginning at 1 5 mcg / kg / min . 
The blood pressure response to stress was abnormal / mildly hypertensive . 
Resting images demonstrated regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the posterior wall . 
At low dose dobutamine [ 1 5 mcg / kg / min ; heart rate 6 8 bpm , blood pressure 2 1 0 / 1 0 0 mmHg ) , there was global hypokinesis and no reduction of cavity size ; however , there was also concerning LV ballooning and inducible ishemia . 
Because of these results , he was thought to be high cardiac risk and was kept in house for cardic catheterization . 
The significiant risk of kidney failure and life - long dialysis was discussed prior to cardiac catheterization . 
The patient decided to undergo the risk with full informed consent . 
Cardiac catheterization did not demonstrate significant coronary artery disease . 
He was medically managed with ASA , BB , [ * * Last Name ( un ) * * ] , statin and his medication doses were adjusted as indicated . 
EGD demonstrated signficiant esophagitis and this was thought to be the cause of his chest pain . 
Given a h / o allergy to lidocaine , he did not receive magic mouthwash and was started on sucralfate . 
He will f / u with GI . 
His PPI was changed to ranitidine [ * * 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] ? effect on his acute renal failure . 
Anemia : He has a baseline anemia due to CKD . 
The patient reported that just prior to moving his care to [ * * Location ( un ) 8 6 * * ] that Epo shots had been started where not currently being administered . 
Two days after EGD his HCT dropped from 3 2 to 2 8 to 2 7 . 
His HCT remained stable at 2 8 and then rose again . 
He was guiac negative , but it is most likely that he had some mild GI bleeding . 
Because of the this HCT drop and because anticoagulants are given during cardiac cath , cardiac cath was defered until his HCT stabilized . 
Pt was then started on Procrit and will receive weekly injections . 
HTN : Uncontrolled while hospitalized , partly because not tolerating all of his PO medications at the begining of his hospital course . 
His valsartan and BB were uptitrated to achieve better control but valsartan was again decreased [ * * 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] renal failure . 
His beta - blocker was limited by bradycardia in the ICU and then HR 6 0 - 7 0 on the floor . 
Clonidine was started and he will take this in patch form . 
Acute on chronic renal failure : The creatinine remained at baseline 2 - 2 . 4 throughout his hospital course but day after catheterization and after having received adquate hydration , sodium bicarbonate and mucomyst pt ' s creatinine jumped to peak 3 . 3 . 
IT weas thought to be secondary to contraste dye versus his PPI has he had high eosinophilia . 
He was changed back to ranitidine . 
He was seen by the renal consult team and will see Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) 8 0 5 * * ] as outpatient .

Discharge Instructions : You were admitted to the hospital with nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain which was thought to be secondary to your gastroparesis , esophagitis and gastritis . 
You had biopsies taken of your esophagus and stomach . 
It is important that you see a gastroenterologist to follow up on these results . 
We increased your doses of anti - acid medication to treat the esophagitis and gastritis . 
We gave you nausea medication and pain medication and your symptoms improved but did not completely resolve . 
You should eat small frequent meals with a low residual diet . 
It will take some time for your nausea and pain to go away as the gastritis resolves . 
You also had chest pain while you were hospitalized . 
Your blood work and EKG ' s were normal but because you have risk factors for heart disease a stress test was performed . 
It showed that you heart has a decreased ability to pump . 
Cardiac catheterization was negative for significant disease . 
You had acute kidney failure and were seen by the kidney specialists . 
This was thought to be secondary to medication effect ( pantoprazole ) and possibly the cardiac catheterization dye . 
Some medication changes were made to better control you blood sugar , blood pressure and cardiac risk factors . 
You should stop taking Erythromycin . 
Please follow the medications as directed . 
Please have the VNA draw a lab to check your creatinine next week . 
You do not need to go to the lab unless the VNA is unable to draw them . 
PLEASE MAKE ALL APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED FOR YOU . 
You have many medical appointments to follow but if you do not keep these appointments you will likely end up back in the hospital . 
Your health is very important and is a full time job and we will help you coordinate your care . 
Please return to the ER for inability to keep food down , chest pain , shortness of breath , fevers , chills , or high blood sugars . 
If you have blood in your stool or vomit , you should return to the emergency room .

States the pain is so bad he is unable to walk . 
He denies any bladder or bowel dysfunction he denies any trauma to his back or legs . 
Pain controlled in the ER with morphine and ibuprofen . 
He reports he would not tolerate a closed MRI tonight even with suggestion . 
Briefly , this patient has history of back pain , L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week . 
The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain . 
He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder . 
No fevers / chills . 
Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets . 
Neurologic exam : A & O x 3 , CN 2 - 1 2 intact , motor 5 / 5 all ext , sensation intact to light touch throughout , nl gait , normal finger - to - nose bilaterally , neg pronator drift . 
Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk , whereas he wasn ' t earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain . 
The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance . 
Given the patient ' s history of prostate CA , he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well . 
Pt was offered MRI today , however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI ( he has tried before with medications ) . 
Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits , it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f / u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week . 
Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms . 
Work - up then involved imaging with a CT scan which I reviewed but do not have the written report on . 
This shows a mass in the head of the pancreas abutting and perhaps distorting the portal vein . 
He has not had any jaundice and does not have any change in his bowel functions . 
A subsequent endoscopic ultrasound examination confirms the mass in the head of the pancreas with features of portal vein invasion . 
Fine needle aspiration has confirmed adenocarcinoma . 
His family history does not include any pancreatic cancer but his father had lung cancer . 
He denies smoking , drinking but exercises by walking about 5 days a week . 
His past surgical history includes a resection of an aortic aneurysm in 2 1 3 1 , cholecystectomy in 2 1 3 1 , prostatectomy for cancer in 2 1 4 2 and resection of a lung cancer in 2 1 4 3 . 
He is said to be allergic to Sudafed and the dye used for CAT scans ( the latter was apparently salivary gland swelling on the day following a CAT scan - - it is unclear whether the two are related ) . 
His review of systems also includes kidneys stones and spinal stenosis . 
He has had some mild recent weight loss . 
He denies symptoms of heart disease , neurologic disease or respiratory disease . 
His review of systems is otherwise unremarkable . 
I think he is not a candidate for attempted surgical resection at this time . 
With the findings consistent with portal vein invasion , he should first be treated with chemoradiation . 
He may be a candidate for subsequent surgery , probably not resection but perhaps intra - operative radiation therapy . 
After discussing the various alternatives we have agreed to have him evaluated in the Sawtooth Cancer Clinic for treatment planning for chemoradiation , with consideration of subsequent IORT . 
He comes from Elk Ridge and probably would prefer to have his treatment carried out at the Elk Ridge Health Center in coordination with us . 
This seems quite reasonable and we will proceed to set that up . 
I will also get a CA 1 9 - 9 today and plan to see him at the completion of his chemoradiation . 
I spent 4 5 minutes in consultation and coordination of care . 
Benjaman Y . Macias , M . D . 
During evaluation of pancreatic cancer , CT revealed pseudoaneurysm of aortic graft . 
Before start of chemotherapy , pt underwent surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm . 
Because pt was not having any symptoms of angina , the decision was made not to intervene on the LCX lesion and to stress the pt at a later date . 
Currently pt is to begin treatment of his pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy and radiation . 
Today pt was to have his first treatment , but starting having chest pain and was sent to the ER for further evaluation .

TF are not being cycled as she gets abdominal pain with cycling . 
Her appetite she admits is not too well , however she has been maintaining her weight at home per records . 
She denies f / c or diarrhea . 
The patient recalls that her Creatinine was elevated to 1 . 5 ( discharged with 1 . 3 ) . 
She does not remember any other values . 
I currently do not have these most recent labs here . 
Given the abnormal labs , she was instructed to return to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for admission . 
Past Medical History : - Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by varices ( grade II ) , mild encephalopathy , ascites and coagulopathy . 
Quit on [ * * 2 1 2 4 - 1 1 - 5 * * ] . 
On admission her sodium was noted to be 1 1 9 and she was started on normal saline . 
In addition her creatinine was 1 . 6 which was double her baseline value . 
Over the next three days we continued to hydrate her and the labs normalized significantly . 
Tube feeds were reinstated . 
She received counseling regarding the lasrge amount of free water she was apparently drinking at home and medications were reviewed as well to assure compliance especially with the immunosuppression regimen . 
She made an excellent recovery . 
The alk phos remained slightly elevated but all other LFTs trended back or were normal . 
There was discussion of further testing but it was determined at this time that no other tests were required and she was sent home still on tube feeds which are now being cycled as she did well with the cycle trial initiated on this admission .

Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system demonstrated no angiographically - apparant flow limiting coronary artery disease . 
The LMCA was short but widely patent . 
The LAD gave off modest calibur diagnoals with a hinge point in D 1 . 
The LAD had a 2 0 % ostial lesion , and mild luminal irregularities leading into a 4 0 % proximal - mid tubular lesion . 
There was a possible intramyocardial segment of the LAD distally , and the distal LAD wrapped around the apex . 
The LAD had slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction . 
The LCX was widely patent and supplied a large OM 2 , a large calibur OM 4 / LPL , a small LPL 2 , and a large left PDA . 
There Lcx had slightly slow flow consistent with mild microvascular dysfunction . 
The RCA was a small and non - dominant vessel free of angiographically - apparant flow limiting coronary artery disease . 
Limted resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic arterial blood presure of 1 2 8 / 6 8 mmHg , and a mildly elevated LVEDP of 2 2 mmHg . 
There was no gradient with careful pullback across the aortic valve .

No angiographically - apparant flow limiting coronary artery disease , with evidence of some athersclerosis and slightly slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction . 
Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure . 
Medical therapy for coronary artery disease with aspirin , betablocker , statin , smoking cessasion , risk factor reduction . 
Brief Hospital Course : 6 3 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC , osteoporosis , ovarian cysts , active smoker for 4 0 years , who presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of sedatives for intubation . 
Her EKG was concerning for ST depressions in the setting of hypotension , with a troponin elevation , so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no angiographical flow limiting disease . 
ACTIVE ISSUES : # Hypotension : Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic 6 0 s , likely secondary to medications for induction . 
Per PACU notes , she received propofol , succ , rocuronium , fentanyl ; she was subsequently treated with IVFs , glycopyrrolate , and neosynephrine with BP subsequently rising to 8 0 s - 9 0 s . 
She received additional fluid boluses in the ICU , but still required dopamine temporarily overnight following her procedure . 
She was quickly weaned off and she maintained her blood pressure in the 9 0 ' s - 1 0 0 ' s systolic afterwards . 
She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from glycopyrrolate . 
Her bradycardia resolved over 2 4 hours . 
Her repeat EKG later showed resolution of ST depressions . 
Pt was evaluated by cardiology who felt that ST depressions were likely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia . 
She had a troponin elevation to Trop elevated to 0 . 3 2 with mild MB elevation to 8 . 
Given that the patient is being evaluated for transplantation , she underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed non significant coronary artery disease . 
She also had a TTE which showed EF > 5 5 % , trace AR and MR . . 
CHRONIC ISSUES : # HCC : Pt with HCV cirrhosis that is well - compensated ( Childs [ * * Doctor Last Name 1 4 4 7 7 * * ] A ) . 
She has no history of jaundice , encephalopathy , ascites , or esophageal varices . 
She will need to have her RFA rescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior to the procedure . 
Transitional Issues : # blood cultures were pending at time of discharge . 
No antibiotics were started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for pneumonia if pt develops symptoms . 
She should have a pre - op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of the procedure . 
Vitamin D 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 unit Capsule Sig : One ( 1 ) Capsule PO once a week . 
Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - Independent . 
You were admitted for a radiofrequency ablation , but had complications from the anesthesia so the procedure was stopped . 
You required a short ICU stay for low blood pressure and a slow heart rate . 
However , your blood pressure and heart rate returned to [ * * Location 2 1 3 * * ] . 
You had a heart catheterization to evaluate for any blockages in the heart , and this was normal . 
We have made no changes to your medications . 
You should also be scheduled for a pre - op evaluation by anesthesia . 
If you do not hear from the clinic within a week , please call [ * * Telephone / Fax ( 1 ) 6 7 3 * * ] .

He takes his own medications and his list is extensive as below . 
He presented to [ * * Hospital 8 8 2 * * ] hospital yesterday with mental status changes , BG 1 8 and hyopthermia . 
His urinalysis was negative at that time and he was sent home . 
He returned w / hypoglycemia and was thus transferred to BDIMC . 
He was given 1 L NS , 1 / 2 A D 5 0 , D 1 0 drip and levofloxacin . 
At the time of transfer to the CCU under MICU service , his BP was 8 9 / 6 3 and FS 1 4 2 . 
His ROS is notable for the falls , dysphagia to solid foods for years , mild dysphagia , and recent GI ilness ( upper and lower ) of his wife for a few weeks ; he had similar symptoms for several days two weeks ago . 
While he gives some detailed history , his answers to many questions are tangential and circumstantial , and in response to being asked why he is here , he describes a vacation that he took with his wife to [ * * Name 2 ( NI ) * * ] five years ago , and her diarrheal ilness . 
His PCP reports that this is baseline for him . 
His wife reports that he takes all of his own medications , and does not typically make mistakes .

CXR : There is a dual lead left subclavian AV pacemaker . 
The heart , mediastinum , and hilar regions are otherwise within normal limits . 
The lungs are clear . 
Brief Hospital Course : . 
It is not clear if his glyburide was recently increased - - this could be a primary contributor to his presentation . 
He has an evident ballantitis which could also be contributing . 
On the evening following admission , his blood glucose levels were maintained at normal levels with D 5 1 / 2 NS gtt titrated to q 1 hour fingersticks . 
Glyburide ' s half life is 2 4 hours , and in keeping with this , hypoglycemic effect wore out within 2 4 hours of admission . 
Subsequently blood glucose levels were > 2 0 0 and the dextrose support was discontinued . 
With the resolution of hypoglycemia , sliding scale insulin was initiated . 
After transfer from the MICU , the patient had blood sugars > 2 5 0 . 
He was started on low dose glipizide prior to discharge . 
Although Glipizide still has some interaction with voriconazole , it has less interaction that Glyburide . 
The patient had been on Glyburide and Voriconazole for many years prior to this episode of hypoglycemia and it was not clear why the patient had hypoglycemia . 
The Glipizide was started back after the patient was found to have blood sugars in the 2 5 0 range . 
He will be seen by his primary care doctor shortly after discharge for further titration of meds . 
Culture results were negative . 
The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin . 
A swab gram stain negative . 
The wound culture was found to grown Diptheroids ( Corynebacterium ) and Coag Negative Staph consistent with skin floral . 
The patient was continued on a topical antifungal as well as IV Ceftriaxone . 
Additionally , a DFA was negative for HSV . 
The patient was discharged on PO Augmentin and will followup with his [ * * Hospital 1 2 0 2 5 * * ] Urologist . 
Thrombocytopenia has been mentioned as a rare side effect of vori , but per ID ' s assessment of risks vs . benefits , would not stop Voriconazole . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] , patient ' s ranitidine was stopped to see what effect it would have on platelets . 
Patient ' s platelets rose from 6 0 s - 8 0 s at baseline to 1 1 2 , making Ranitidine a possible cause of the patient ' s thrombocytopenia . 
The patient was instructed not to take Ranitidine anymore . 
He will followup at [ * * Hospital 1 2 0 2 5 * * ] for further monitoring of his thrombocytopenia . 
He was continued on voriconazole and nystatin S & S was added to his regimen . 
He had no further evidence of thrush upon transfer to the floor from the MICU . 
The patient was anticoagulated with warfarin . 
Flecainide was continued as per his outpatient regimen . 
He was continued on Bactrim for PCP [ * * Name Initial ( PRE ) 1 1 0 2 * * ] . 
He will followup with his renal doctor at [ * * Hospital 3 5 8 7 0 * * ] upon discharge .

She has had an episode of aspiration about one year ago as well as urosepsis a few months ago . 
In the ED , her vitals were T 9 8 . 9 F , HR 1 3 0 , BP 1 5 8 / 6 6 , RR 4 0 and O 2 sat of 9 1 % on RL . 
A chest xray taken showed widespread coarse reticular opacities but no signs of consolidation . 
She was given solumedrol given her history of COPD . 
She was also started on IV Vancomycine and Aztreonam ( due to a PCN allergy ) as well as metronidazole . 
She was also given 1 L Normal Saline for alactate of 4 . 7 . 
EKG showed sinus tachycardia . 
She was then admitted to the MICU for further care . 
In the MICU , her Aztreonam was dc ' ed , and she was started on cefepime instead . 
She was also started on an insulin sliding scale . 
Her lactate returned to 1 . 3 , and her cre and WBC trended down as well ( WBC 2 6 ) . 
Her IV fluids were tricky since any flow > 7 5 cc / hr led to hypertension with sbp int he 1 7 0 ' s . 
However , she was able to tolerate small boluses of fluids . 
A straight cath performed also showed purulent liquid , though her urine cultures from [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 7 - 2 5 * * ] were negative .

Abdomen : soft , non - tender , non - distended , bowel sounds present , no organomegaly GU : no foley ( d / c ' ed on [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] ) Ext : warm , well perfused , 2 + pulses , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema . 
Some of this may reflect the PA rather than AP frontal view . 
Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases . 
In addition , the atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in extent and there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus , potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion . 
No cardiomegaly . 
Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta . 
No pneumothorax . 
EKG : [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 6 - 3 0 * * ] : Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy . 
Low limb lead voltage . 
Prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 7 - 2 6 * * ] the axis is more rightward , atrial ectopy has appeared . 
Otherwise , no diagnostic interim change . 
SIRS 4 PROGRESS NOTE [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] Assessment and Plan : Ms . [ * * Known lastname * * ] is a [ * * Age over 9 0 * * ] F with a history of COPD , alzheimer ' s dementia , and aspiration who presented from her nursing home in acute respiratory distress after eating lunch . 
Initial CXR showed multiple reticular opacities but no consolidations . 
Repeat CXR showed less prominant bilateral opacifications , though there is possible bilateral pleural effusions with some compressed atelectasis at the bases . 
Initially on Vancomycin and Cefepime , switched to IV Ceftriaxone to treat UTI since pna was unlikely . 
IVF was at 4 0 cc / ml for the last 3 days of her hospitalization . 
PO trial of thick liquids started on [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 7 - 2 9 * * ] , which pt tolerated well . 
Lungs sounded a lot clearer with residual right base crackles . 
Pt breathing comfortably at 9 4 % O 2 sat on room air . 
However , EKG compared with one in [ * * 2 1 4 2 * * ] , which also showed similar changes . 
Troponins elevated at 0 . 0 6 x 2 but did not trend up , likely from transient ischemia due to increased cardiac demand [ * * 1 2 - 3 0 * * ] infection . 
No signs of acute cardiac event . 
Medical management with beta blocker , asa discussed with family , who declined due to allergy to asa and desire for minimal medication . 
Patient did tolerate beta - blocker ( metoprolol 6 . 2 5 mg ) for one dose and seemed to perk up afterwards , but given difficulty in administration here in the hospital ( took patient an hour to swallow pill ) did not continue . 
Can be considered as outpatient . 
Likely secondary to a UTI . 
Grossly positive UA though urine culture was negative , PMH of recurrent UTIs , recent admission to [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] with urosepsis from multi - drug resistant E . coli , necessitating treatment with primaxin . 
Straight cath in MICU drained purulent material . 
Urine culture showed no growth , but per pt ' s son , pt had already received IV abx at that time . 
Plan to complete 7 day course of ceftriaxone on [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 8 - 3 * * ] . 
Per MICU and patient ' s son , patient become hypotensive with no fluids but rapidly becomes hypertensive ( up to sbp of 1 7 0 ' s ) if fluids given too fast . 
At present appears to respond well to slow small fluid boluses , at a rate of 7 5 - 1 0 0 cc / hr . 
Was continued on IVF at 4 0 cc / hr per pts son as an amount that she has tolerated well in the past . 
Changed to regular insulin sliding . 
Glucose stable . 
Januvia held while inpatient and continued to use reduced dose insulin slididng scale . 
Can restart Januvia on d / c . 
Limit sit time to 1 hr at time and sit on a pressure redist cushion . 
Protect intact skin midback and coccyx area with Critic aid Clear daily and prn or every 3 rd cleansing . 
Resolved on switch to ceftriaxone . 
Followed their initial recs of OOBx 3 per day . 
Transitional Issues - Encourage PO intake - Completion of ceftriaxone 1 gm q 2 4 hrs - last dose on [ * * 2 1 5 2 - 8 - 3 * * ] - Consideration of maintenance fluids - Consider beta blocker ( per pt ' s family , pt seemed to perk up after single dose of metoprolol 6 . 2 5 mg PO . 
Systolic BP decreased to 1 2 0 ' s , HR in 7 0 ' s , Respiration rate to 1 6 - 2 0 ) .

Because the pt had several episodes of hemoptysis ( and one in the ED ) the pt was admitted for bronchoscopy . 
On [ * * 2 1 7 2 - 1 1 - 2 0 * * ] the pt was taken for bronchoscopy which was unable to be performed due to difficulties with sedation , and a significant amount of periglottic edema . 
The pt was then taken to the OR for bronchoscopy under genearal anesthesia and endotracheal intubation , and during the procedure a fresh clot was visualized in the left lingula , which , when gently disturbed , produced brisk bleeding . 
Due to the extent of bleeding patient was left intubated and transfered to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for further evaluation .

The details of her history are sparse and are taken primarily from her OSH chart . 
She presented originally on [ * * 7 - 2 2 * * ] complaining of worsened shortness of breath and generalized weakness . 
A tentative diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was made and she was treated with lovenox . 
She was also noted to be febrile and to have slurred speech on admission . 
A head CT was then performed which showed a large bleed as described above . 
Arrangements were made to transfer her to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for ICU level care . 
Head CT [ * * 2 1 7 3 - 7 - 2 6 * * ] : There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal region with extension into the ventricular system . 
There is a moderate amount of edema surrounding this hemorrhage and there is mass effect and approximately 1 . 4 cm of midline shift to the right . 
There is subfalcine herniation . 
Blood is seen in the left lateral ventricle as well as the occipital [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 3 4 * * ] of the right lateral ventricle . 
The sulci and gyri of the entire left cerebral hemisphere are effaced . 
The [ * * Doctor Last Name 3 5 2 * * ] - white matter differentiation within the right hemisphere is preserved . 
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable . 
The visualized paranasal sinuses show opacification of the right sphenoid sinus . 
IMPRESSION : Large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the ventricular system , mass effect , midline shift , and uncal herniation . 
If prior examinations exist , they would be helpful for comparison to detail interval changes . 
Brief Hospital Course : The patient was admitted for management of her large intraparenchymal bleed . 
The etiology was thought to be most likely from amyloid angiopathy . 
The neurosurgery team consulted and the patient and discussed options with the family and it was decided that surgery ( draining the lesion ) would not likely benefit the patient . 
She was loaded with dilantin . 
Her exam remained stable . 
The family made the patient DNR but not DNI . 
A family meeting was held and the family decided in favor of placing a tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube . 
These procedures were done without complication . 
The patient was initially placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis due to her ICH . 
She had no events and the dilantin was eventually d / c ' d . 
The patient remained hemodynamically stable . 
She has a goal SBP of 1 1 0 - 1 5 0 . 
The patient did appear to have a slight rash on her truck upon d / c that was attributed to her dilantin that was recently d / c ' d . 
On [ * * 7 - 3 1 * * ] she spiked a fever to 1 0 3 she remianed febrile for ~ 5 days . 
Eventually she had a sputum culture + for staph aureus . 
The patient was started on levofloxacin for a 1 0 day course . 
At the time of d / c she was afebrile . 
She was accepted for placement at [ * * Hospital 3 7 * * ] .

His IABP was removed a few days post operatively . 
He developed new anterior ST changes , and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his LV function from 6 6 % to 1 9 % . 
He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab . 
Coronary angiography revealed a widely patent SVG to OM , a 3 0 % ostial lesion in the SVG to the PDA and PLV . 
The LIMA was patent , but there was no flow into the distal LAD . 
He underwent stenting of the LIMA anastomosis into the LAD with a 2 . 5 mm x 1 8 mm , 2 . 5 mm x 1 2 mm and 2 . 5 mm x 1 2 mm MiniVision stents . 
His post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a Serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function .

Brief Hospital Course : Patient is a 7 4 year - old female with CAD , DMII , CHF , AFib , and COPD who was initially admitted to the MICU for bradycardia , hypotension , and acute renal failure . 
The following issues were addressed during her hospital stay : . 
Patient responded well to IV fluid boluses and withholding of anti - hypertensives ( patient was on significant doses of Coreg and Cartia ) . 
Clinical suspicion for tamponade was low , and no pulsus on exam was noted ; ECHO confirmed clinical suspicion . 
On transfer to the floor , hypotension was no longer an issue , and medications were cautiously added at lower dosages . 
Patient to follow - up with PCP and cardiologist for further titration of medications as tolerated . 
Patient with long course of what appeared to be viral gastrointestinal illness precipitating dehydration and worsening renal function . 
No other source could be identified , stool assays were unremarkable . 
Renal U / S was with evidence of nephrolithiasis with focal hydronephrosis , but this was unchanged from a prior study . 
ARF was pre - renal in nature , and highly responsive to IV fluid hydration . 
Patient ' s Cr steadily improved to 0 . 9 on discharge .

She developed symptoms of a URI approximately one week prior to admission with cough , sore throat , and rhinorrhea / post - nasal drip . 
The cough was intermittently productive of a clear phlegm . 
She went to sleep the night before admission with continued URI sx but awoke at 2 am with sharp right sided chest pain , worse with deep inspiration , radiating to her right shoulder blade and occasionally horizontally across the cest and up retrosternally . 
The pain occurs while ambulating and at rest ( no distinct difference ) , is not associated with eating , but does get worse when leaning forward . 
She denies fevers / chills , n / v / d , dysuria / hematuria , rashes . 
She has chronic constipation , dyspepsia with early satiety , orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion that has been present and increasing gradually over the last six months . 
The patient had a stress test in the past for left sided chest pain , without ecg changes , no perfusion defects on MIBI . 
She called her PCP who had her get a CXR that showed a right sided pleural effusion and pleural opacities that was followed - up with a CTA that failed to demonstrate PE but did show r . pleural effusion and non - pathologic nodules . 
An ECG showed no significant changes from baseline . 
Her D - dimer was > [ * * 2 1 9 3 * * ] , wbc 1 3 - > 1 1 , and LFT ' s were all within normal limits . 
The patient recieved toradol 1 5 mg IV for pain with moderate effect . 
Pt had CT that showed exudative right pleural effusion with negativ ecytology . 
She was also scheduled for VATS given multiple pleural based nodules . 
She also developed fever to 1 0 1 . 7 , tachycardia , new wheezing and was thought to have pna with component of RAD / COPD . 
Given this new wheeze , she was started on solumedrol and [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 1 0 2 3 8 * * ] ( pt without history of RAD ) . 
Pt developed hypercarbic respiratory failure , initially responded to nebs but then began to have decreased air movement despite receiving racemic epi . 
Pt was then transferred to MICU for mgt / observation of airway . 
Pt was seen by ENT in MICU who did not visualize any anatomic obstruction . 
Pt put on facemask bipap on admission to MICU . 
Past Medical History : PMH : 1 . 
ECG is within normal limits . 
Compared to the previous tracing of [ * * 2 1 9 7 - 1 - 2 0 * * ] no diagnostic interval change . 
New ill - defined peripheral opacities in right mid and lower lung zone . 
In a patient with pleuritic chest pain , pulmonary embolism should be considered . 
In the absence of infectious symptoms , infection is unlikely . 
Therefore , a CT angiogram may be considered for more complete assessment as communicated to Dr . [ * * First Name ( STitle ) * * ] . 
There are several mediastinal lymph nodes , the largest of which is in the precarinal space and measures 1 . 4 cm . 
Lung window images reveal a rightsided pleurased nodular density and several small nodules scattered in both lungs , the largest of which is in the right lower lobe anterior to the pleural effusion and measures 8 mm . 
Atelectasis is seen at the right lung base . 
There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax . 
There is a small pericardial effusion . 
CT angiogram demonstrates no pulmonary embolus . 
The pulmonary artery is somewhat prominent in size measuring up to 3 . 5 cm . 
The aorta is normal in caliber and there is no evidence of aortic dissection . 
Calcifications are seen throughout the aorta . 
The osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable . 
The visualized portion of the upper abdomen is normal . 
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above findings . 
IMPRESSION : No pulmonary embolus . 
Right pleural effusion . 
Small pericardial effusion . 
Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary hypertension . 
Several small nodules within both lungs , including pleural - based rightsided nodular density . 
The largest of these is 8 mm , located in the right lower lobe . 
These are nonspecific in nature . 
Differential diagnosis includes inflammatory / infectious process , less likely vasculitis or neoplastic disease . 
Correlate clinically and with followup CT scan . 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) . 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal . 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal . 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated . 
The aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present . 
Mild ( 1 + ) aortic regurgitation is seen . 
The mitral leaflets appear structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation . 
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension . 
There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion . 
IMPRESSION : Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function . 
Mild aortic regurgitation . 
Based on [ * * 2 1 9 0 * * ] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a moderate risk ( prophylaxis recommended ) . 
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data . 
Mesothelial cells and lymphocytes . 
Persistent small right pleural effusion . 
Nodular density right mid zone for which follow up is recommended . 
Nodular opacities in the right lung , as noted on previous CT scan . 
Persistent large layering right - sided pleural effusion . 
If further detail of the opacities in the right hemithorax would be helpful clinically , we reiterate the earlier recommendation for follow - up CT when clinically appropriate . 
Overall unchanged appearance of the chest . 
There are coronary artery calcifications seen . 
There has been interval development of collapse of the right lower lobe . 
The previously seen right pleural effusion has increased in size , and now is a large right pleural effusion . 
There is a tiny left pleural effusion as well . 
In addition , there is extensive nodular thickening of the pleural surface which has developed in the interval in the right upper lobe . 
The rapidity of this process makes this possibly secondary to fibrin degradation products . 
There is a small calcified granuloma again seen in the right middle lobe . 
Again seen is precarinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 1 . 7 cm . 
There are small axillary lymph nodes , unchanged . 
No pneumothorax . 
Few images though the abdomen demonstrate small gastrohepatic ligament lymph nodes . 
BONE WINDOWS : No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion . 
IMPRESSION : 1 ) Interval collapse of right lower lobe with a large right pleural effusion . 
There is a focus of air in the fluid which could be secondary to an attempted paracentesis , or else infection is a possibility . 
Pleural biopsy ( A - B ) : Metastatic non - small cell carcinoma ( see note ) . 
Pleural contents ( C - D ) : Metastatic non - small cell carcinoma ( see note ) . 
Note : Immunostains show tumor staining for CEA ( focal ) , Cytokeratin ( AE 1 / AE 3 , CAM 5 . 2 ) and S 1 0 0 ( scattered cells ) , but is negative for MART - 1 , TTF - 1 , B 7 2 . 3 , and Calretinin . 
Circumferential nodular and irregular thickening of the right pleural surface , with associated enhancement and pleural effusion are consistent with neoplastic pleural disease and malignant effusion . 
In regions , there appears to be invasion of the pericardium . 
There is atelectasis at the right lung base , although superimposed infection cannot be excluded . 
One of the right - sided chest tubes is malpositioned . 
Although the field of view of the CT makes assessment of skin exit sites difficult , it appears that the chest tube which has a more anterior position , with only a short segment of the tubing beneath the skin , is a malpositioned chest tube . 
Please note that the chest tube which extends from the lung base to the lung apex in a vertical configuration , as seen on the chest x - ray , is appropriately positioned . 
A focal lytic lesion within the L 1 vertebral body could represent a hemangioma . 
However , appearances are suspicious for a metastatic lesion , particularly given the pleural disease described above . 
Bone scan would be useful for further evaluating this lesion , and for evaluation of other occult skeletal metastases . 
Brief Hospital Course : Mrs . [ * * Known lastname * * ] is a 7 6 year - old female with multiple medical problems including HBV , fatty liver , colonic mass s / p resection , HTN , hyperlipidemia , who was initally admitted on [ * * 1 0 - 2 3 * * ] for increasing dyspnea over the six weeks prior to admission and increased pleuritic chest pain on the right side . 
CTA was also done to rule out a pulmonary embolus . 
This did not show a PE ; however , showed several mediastinal lymph nodes , the largest precarinal , measuring 1 . 4 cm . 
There was also right - sided pleural nodular densities and several small nodules bilaterally , the largest located in the RLL anterior to the pleural effusion , measuring ~ 8 mm . 
Right lung base atelectasis was present , with a moderate - sized pleural effusion . 
No PE was seen , however . 
The differential at that time was thought to be inflammatory / infectious , less likely vasculitis or neoplastic . 
A follow - up CT was recommended . 
On [ * * 2 1 9 7 - 1 0 - 2 5 * * ] , thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion was performed by the interventional pulmonology fellow and the pleural fluid obtained was consistent with an exudative fluid with an elevated red count ( trauma ) and lymphocytsosis . 
Cultures of the fluid were negative , and cytology was negative for malignant cells . 
The patient then developed fevers to 1 0 1 . 7 with new wheezing and was thought to have a pneumonia with a component of reactive airway disease / COPD . 
On [ * * 1 0 - 2 8 * * ] , she was started on vancomycin / flagyl / levofloxacin ( these were later discontinued on [ * * 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] ) . 
She was also started on solumedrol and MDI ' s . 
On [ * * 1 0 - 3 0 * * ] , Mrs . [ * * Known lastname * * ] then developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and was found to have stridor / wheezing on exam which did not improve with racemic epi . 
At this point , she was transferred to the MICU . 
In the MICU , the patient was stabilized on BIPAP and nebulizers . 
She was transferred back to the floor on [ * * 1 1 - 5 * * ] . 
After a few days on the floor , the patient again developed increasing dyspnea . 
A CXR was performed which showed an increase in the size of her right sided effusion . 
On [ * * 1 1 - 9 * * ] , another thoracentesis was attempted to take fluid off and make the patient more comfortable ; however , fluid could not be aspirated . 
The patient ' s lung was imaged by the interventional pulmonology ( IP ) fellow with US and thick fluid vs . consildation vs . lung parenchyma was obseved . 
The IP fellow suggested that a CT scan be performed for better characterization of the effusion seen on CXR , as well as VATS to obtain tissue at the pleural nodule for a diagnosis . 
The patient could not lie supine due to significant respiratory distress , so she was transferred back to the MICU for elective intubtaion to obtain CT scan and subsequent VATS . 
The repeat chest CT on [ * * 1 1 - 1 0 * * ] showed an increased right sided collection with worsening atelactasis of right middle lobe and right lower lobe . 
There was also increased nodular thickening of right upper lobe . 
On [ * * 2 1 9 7 - 1 1 - 1 0 * * ] , Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) 1 7 5 * * ] ( thoracic surgery ) performed a VATS and pleural biopsy . 
Two chest tubes were placed during the surgery for drainage of her effusion . 
The effusion was loculated , so thoracic surgery used TPA to break up fibrinous locuations . 
Mrs . [ * * Known lastname * * ] did well post - op with only minor pain at the incision site . 
This was controlled with morphine . 
On [ * * 1 1 - 1 2 * * ] , the patient was trasferred back to the floor . 
She was maintained on nebulizers for respiratory comfort and morphine for pain control . 
On [ * * 1 1 - 1 5 * * ] , the pathology from her pleural biopsy obtained during VATS revealed a metastatic non - small cell lung cancer . 
Immunostains were positive for CEA , cytokeratin , and S 1 0 0 , but negative for MART - 1 , TTF - 1 , B 7 2 . 3 , and calretinin . 
The patient was notified of the results and she reported that she did not want any chemotherapy . 
After agreement by the patient , medical oncology was consulted to review her case and present the possible options to her before she made this decision final . 
After seeing oncology , the patient still held to not wanted chemotherapy . 
She said that she wanted to go home to [ * * State 3 9 1 4 * * ] with her son , who is a retired nurse . 
Her son decided that he would care for her in his home . 
He arranged to have hospital bed sent to his home , and arranged to have physician who will visit Mrs . [ * * Known lastname * * ] at home . 
An ambulance was arranged to transport the patient from [ * * Location ( un ) 8 6 * * ] to [ * * State 3 9 1 4 * * ] . 
PNEUMONIA : The patient had a CXR done on [ * * 1 0 - 2 7 * * ] which showed a nodular density right mid zone . 
Given her fragile respiratory status , this was treated as pneumonia with levo / flagyl / vancomycin . 
The antibiotic course was continued from [ * * 1 0 - 2 8 * * ] until [ * * 1 1 - 1 1 * * ] . 
NON - ST ELEVATION MI : During her admission , the patient had episodes of chest pain . 
At one point , her cardiac enzymes trended up to a high of trop = 0 . 3 2 . 
EKG was without changes . 
These cardiac enzymes subsequently trended down . 
Other episodes of chest pain on this admission were not accompanied by EKG changes or elevation of cardiac enzymes . 
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE : During her admission , the patient had ARF with a high creatinine of 3 . 6 . 
The was likely of prerenal etiology given her urine lytes at the time . 
With IV hydration , her creatinine trended down , and on discharge was 0 . 5 * 5 . 
ANEMIA : The patient had a low Hct throughout her admission ( low 3 0 ' s to high 2 0 ' s ) . 
Her stools were guaiac negative . 
She was transfused to maintain Hct < 3 0 . 
ABDOMINAL PAIN : Mrs . [ * * Known lastname * * ] periodically complained RUQ and epigastric abdominal pain throughout her admission . 
Two RUQ ultrasounds were obtained which were normal without evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystits . 
Her LFTs and amylase / lipase also remained within normal limits . 
Her abdominal pain was thought to be due to peptic ulcer disease . 
She was maintained on her PPI . 
DIARRHEA : She also complained of diarrhea towards the end of her hospital course . 
She was tested for C . diff , which was negative x 3 . 
Her diarrhea was likely a side effect of her antibiotics . 
HTN : The patient was maintained on her outpatient regimen for HTN . 
CODE STATUS : Throughout her hospital admission , the patient was full code . 
After she was given the diagnosis of NSCC , this issue was re - addressed . 
After a discussion with the patient and her son , she made the decision to change her status to DNR / DNI and maintained that status on discharge from the hospital .

Patient was in her USOH until Sunday evening when she developed abdominal pain , non - bloody vomiting , and nausea . 
She describes the pain as sharp and crampy with severity ranging from [ * * 2 1 2 1 - 4 - 2 6 * * ] pain with inability to take PO ' s since Sunday afternoon . 
She denies sick contacts at her nursing home but does state that there ' s been a stomach bug going around . 
She presented to [ * * Hospital 6 1 9 1 5 5 * * ] earlier today where her initial VS were 9 8 . 2 , 9 2 , 1 7 9 / 9 2 , 2 4 , 9 2 % RA .

RUQ U / S showed thick GB wall but no stones . 
She was transferred here for further management .

Dilation of the gallbladder is nonspecific without accompanying secondary signs of cholecystitis . 
No definitive acute infectious process identified . 
Large left hemidiaphragmatic defect without definitive evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation . 
Equivocal fat stranding is seen here and the contrast column has not cleared this point - delayed plain film might be useful 4 . 
Marked demineralization accompanied by severe degenerative changes of the spine and hips . 
Multiple age indeterminate thoracic compression fractures . 
Minimal right base atelectasis . 
There is mild prominence of the extra - and intra - hepatic biliary ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 1 0 mm . 
However , the patient has an equivocal [ * * Doctor Last Name 5 1 5 * * ] sign post - medication as demonstrated by the attending radiologist . 
Acalculous cholecystitis can not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting . 
Brief Hospital Course : 8 5 F with a history of CHF , COPD , pulmonary fibrosis who presents with nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain since Sunday . 
Imaging at OSH significant for likely cholecystitis . 
Deemed poor surgical candidate so transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for consideration of percutaneous drainage by IR . 
She was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving sepsis . 
She underwent RUQ U / S here with findings that could be consistent with acalculous cholecystitis . 
She was evaluated in the ED by general surgery who felt she was not an ideal operative candidate and suggested HIDA scan and evaluation by IR for percutaneous cholecystostomy . 
EGD also evaluated her but deferred to IR given the lack of obstructive findings on her LFT ' s . 
CT torso and HIDA scan were negative for cholecystitis but did demonstrate dilated gall bladder . 
CT torso also demonstrated known large diaphragmatic hernia with stomach and bowel in the left chest with mild stranding and old PO contrast from OSH possibly c / w recent inflammation of the intrathoracic bowel . 
IR thus felt there would be little benefit from intervention . 
Patient was started on vanc / zosyn , became abdominal pain free , afebrile , with a downtrending white count and was called out to the floor for further management . 
The patient did well on the floor . 
Her vancomycin was discontinued . 
She remained on zosyn and completed a 7 - day course in house . 
Symptoms resolved at the time of discharge . 
She had a CT head which was negative for acute process . 
This was thought to be the result of oversedation from meds ( IV morphine , klonopin PRN , PM amitryptiline , and antiemetics ) . 
Her level of alertness spontaneously resolved following these episodes . 
A C . Diff was negative . 
She was maintained on IVF . 
Her vancomycin was stopped as above . 
The patient ' s bowel regimen was stopped . 
The diarrhea improved . 
Bowel regimen may be resumed as outpatient PRN . 
Nutrition evaluated her and felt that she need maximal supplementation of her diet . 
The psychiatry team evaluated her while she was in the hospital and started mirtazapine 7 . 5 mg QPM ( 1 hour before meals ) . 
On the last evening of her admission she was able to sleep . 
Her depression should be monitored while on this medication for signs of improvement . 
She warrants ongoing evaluation of her symptoms and medications . 
At the moment she appears well nourished , but if her diet and appetite do not improve with treatment of her depression then nutrition felt she might require tube feeds and evaluation for PEG tube . 
This was briefly discussed with her son , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 1 0 2 8 1 * * ] . 
Given that she is still recovering from an acute abdominal insult , it was felt that further evaluation could take place on an outpatient basis . 
IF she does not produce urine she will need to be bladder scanned and possibly straight cathed if scanned for > 5 0 0 . 
At the time of discharge she was incontinent of urine . 
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES : # COPD : Treated for exacerbation with rapid steroid taper in early [ * * Month ( only ) 5 4 7 * * ] . 
No active wheezing on exam . 
Continued on nebs in - house . 
On home furosemide and digoxin which were initially held . 
Pt ' s digoxin level non - toxic on admission .

Prior surgical incisions consistent with previous segmentectomy well - healed , non - indurated , non - erythematous , non - tender . 
His initial labs demonstrated a significant anemia , with a hematocrit of 1 9 . 7 . 
Further review of his history raised the possibility of an upper GI bleed , as it was determined he had been taking high doses of NSAIDs for his abdominal pain , and had unclear history of melanotic stools and / or blood - tinged emesis . 
He was initially admitted to the Surgical ICU , where he was stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells . 
His hematocrit then rose to 2 3 . 4 , at which time he was transfused an additional 2 units . 
His hematocrit then stabilized at 2 8 . 2 . 
A CT of his abdomen performed shortly after admission on [ * * 2 1 3 8 - 8 - 1 3 * * ] revealed the following : 1 . 
Extensive hepatic lesions ( presumably HCC ) with extensive mesenteric root , porta hepatis lymphadenopathy , and mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric / omental implants and possible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as described above . 
Nonhemorrhagic ascites . 
No areas of active hemorrhage within the mass lesions or along the course of the bowel are present . 
Gastroesophageal varices . 
Nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis . 
New bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning for metastases . 
Given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was determined to be not eligible for surgical resection . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] also received an esophago - gastric endoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper GI bleed , anemia , and abdominal pain . 
This study revealed the following : - [ * * Name Prefix ( Prefixes ) * * ] [ * * Last Name ( Prefixes ) * * ] B distal esophagitis , 2 cords of small esophageal varices without red whale signs left undisturbed , irregular GEJ with 2 tongues of salmon like mucosa left undisturbed . 
One small 1 cm clean based ulcer with surrounding edema and erythema left undisturbed . 
Retroflex view revealed a moderate hiatal hernia , hiatus ~ 3 cm . 
The etiology of his anemia was determined to be a combination of hepatic lesions / HCC as well as upper GI bleed , possibly secondary to NSAID use . 
After hemodynamic and cardiovascular stabilization with transfusions as above , Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] was transferred out of the SICU to the surgical floor . 
His liver lesions and clinical case was discussed during a multi - disciplinary hepatic tumor conference . 
It was determined he would benefit from biopsy of his lesions , with possible systemic therapy to be determined as an outpatient . 
Mr . [ * * Known lastname * * ] future outpatient care was coordinated with the hematology - oncology service , and he was discharged on [ * * 8 - 1 6 * * ] , [ * * 2 1 3 7 * * ] .

Brief Hospital Course : 8 3 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post STEMI and RCA stent in [ * * 2 1 2 7 * * ] , anterior STEMI [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 2 - 2 1 * * ] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD , anterior STEMI [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 3 - 1 * * ] with stent thrombosis , DMII , HTN , and CRI . 
Patient presented with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V 1 - V 4 and ST depressions in II III and aVf . 
By cardiac angiography he was found to have completely occluded proximal LAD , 8 0 % occlusion of the Lcx and complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from collaterals . 
The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare metal stent was placed . 
During the procedure the patient became hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple cardioversions . 
After emesis he was intubated for airway protection . 
He was then transfered to the CCU and started on [ * * Month / Day / Year * * ] , plavix , and heparin . 
On [ * * 2 1 3 7 - 3 - 1 * * ] pt developed chest pain while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in V 1 - V 3 . 
He was treated with nitroglycerin , O 2 , and morphine which resulted in alleviation of his symptoms . 
At cardiac catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved flow through the LAD stent . 
He remains on Toprol XL 2 5 mg daily , [ * * Last Name ( LF ) 1 7 3 3 9 * * ] , [ * * First Name 3 ( LF ) * * ] , and Plavix daily . 
An IABP was not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta . 
He was initially started on dopamine . 
In the first 2 4 hours post cath he developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia and hypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine that required atropine boluses on one occasion . 
He was transitioned to levophed on [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] . 
Metoprolol was started on [ * * 2 - 2 4 * * ] . 
After maintaining pressure well he taken off levophed on [ * * 2 - 2 6 * * ] . 
On [ * * 3 - 1 * * ] he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinical exam and has begun on Lasix for diuresis . 
On the day of discharge the lasix dose was increased to 8 0 mg daily . 
This can be titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters . 
ACE - I / ARBs was held due to concerns for renal function ; if renal function recovers to baseline , we would strongly recommended ACE inhibitor therapy for decreased EF . 
Will need to have creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehab facility . 
Needs strict intake / output measurement along with daily weights . 
At that time he was then started on amiodarone drip . 
He was transfered to the CCU in NSR and the amiodarone was discontinued . 
On [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] and then again on [ * * 2 - 2 4 * * ] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilator weens . 
Both episodes were treated with amiodarone and metoprolol and he returned to NSR . 
Since [ * * 2 - 2 4 * * ] he has been in NSR on daily metropolol and amiodarone . 
He is also on coumadin . 
Coumadin dose was held on [ * * 3 - 2 5 * * ] for supratherapeutic INR . 
Plan is to restart coumadin on [ * * 3 - 6 * * ] , INR on [ * * 3 - 5 * * ] at the time of discharge was 3 . 1 , was receiving a dose of 5 mg , patient was being loaded on amiodarone . 
The dose of amiodarone will be decreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5 mg and check frequent INR level to ensure he is not supratherapeutic and adjust as necessary . 
He was removed from mechanical ventilation on [ * * 2 - 2 5 * * ] . 
Since , he has used up to 3 L O 2 by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea though he has maintained 0 2 saturations above 9 5 % . 
After ecoli was found in a sputum culture he completed a course of ciprofloxacin . 
The dose was uptitrated from 4 0 mg PO lasix to 8 0 mg PO lasix based on increased pulmonary edema on CXR . 
VQ scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on [ * * 3 - 4 * * ] . 
He arrived to the CCU with a Non AG acidosis of unclear etiology that resolved over the next several days . 
His Cr peaked on [ * * 2 - 2 3 * * ] at 4 . 4 and then declined steadily declined to 2 . 4 on [ * * 3 - 4 * * ] despite receiving another 6 0 cc dye load on [ * * 3 - 1 * * ] . 
He never required HD , although renal consult team followed closely . 
He will need renal follow up as an outpatient . 
As mentioned above VQ scan was negative . 
He was maintained on heparin and then transitioned to coumadin . 
Because of DVT despite heparin for ACS on presentation and antiplatelet therapy peri - MI as well as in - stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelet therapy , concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt should have full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable .

Pt was in his normal state of health until about a week ago when he began to notice an increase in the number of times he had to urinate . 
Although he has nocturia at baseline ( usually wakes 3 - 4 times per week to use the bathroom at night ) , he began to use the bathroom during the day with increasing frequency , every 1 5 - 2 0 minutes . 
He found that he was urinating only a very small amount , " several drops " each time and felt like he had not completely emptied his bladder . 
Then , on [ * * 2 1 0 5 - 7 - 1 4 * * ] , the patient woke up and felt generally weak . 
He noticed his speech was slurred and his legs felt unsteady when getting up from bed . 
The weakness came on all of a sudden and he felt a cramping fatigue worst in his calves . 
He had no trouble understanding others or finding words , but noticed his pronunciation of words was impaired . 
In addition , he also felt intermittently very cold and then very hot . 
When his partner arrived home , she too immediately noticed the changes in his speech and brought him to the ED at [ * * Hospital 3 * * ] . 
At [ * * Hospital 1 * * ] initial VS were : 9 8 . 2 7 2 1 5 6 / 8 2 1 4 9 8 % on RA .

Brief Hospital Course : 6 4 y / o African American male with a PMH of DMII and HTN who presented with generalized weakness , altered mental status , slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts of urination . 
He was found to be in acute renal failure at an OSH and transferred here to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] for possible hemodialysis . 
He was stabilized medically in the ICU until [ * * 7 - 1 6 * * ] when his care was transitioned to the general medicine service . 
His ARF was largely attributed to obstruction as he was retaining over 5 0 0 cc urine and found to have large symmetric prostate on DRE . 
However , no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound . 
Additionally , he was also on a number of potentially nephrotoxigenic medications causing ATN , including lisinopril , NSAIDs , and potassium citrate . 
He was initially medically managed in the ICU IVF , lasix , bicarb with good effect . 
Renal function gradually improved over several days following catheter placement , fluid support , and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenic drugs . 
He was discharged with a Cr of 5 . 7 , and not restarted on his nephrotoxic meds . 
He will be followed by renal as an outpatient . 
Furthermore , he was started on Tamsulosin for his BPH . 
His foley remained in place to allow [ * * 5 - 2 6 * * ] day bladder rest before urology will try voiding trial as an outpatient in the next few days . 
Potassium levels dropped with administration of kayexalate , insulin , and bicarbonate . 
Serial EKGS also showed resolution of peaked T waves . 
However , these were discontinued in light of his ARF . 
His blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin . 
Since he required Humalog 5 - 7 units for the last 3 days of hospitalization , he was sent home on Lantus 2 units QHS with lispro sliding scale coverage . 
He was also provided with an educational counseling session regarding home insulin . 
His oral hypoglycemics were held , with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renal approval and Cr normalization . 
DRE revealed symmetric enlargement of prostate . 
Previous biopsy was benign . 
Was started on Tamsulosin this admission . 
Urology will follow in clinic for void trial . 
After transfer to the floor , he was continued on his Amlodipine 5 mg and Metoprolol succinate 1 0 0 daily . 
Quinapril discontinued indefinitely . 
Tamsulosin added for BPH . 
Until then , foley will remain in place and he will be visited by VNA for foley - related care . 
Also should repeat chem 7 to follow up K and Cr .

Level of Consciousness : Alert and interactive . 
Activity Status : Ambulatory - Independent . 
You were hospitalized because of changes in mental status , decreased urine output , generalized weakness , and decreased functioning of your kidney . 
Your kidney injury was most likely caused by an obstruction of the bladder as a result of your large prostate . 
You were treated with IV fluid resuscitation , that you tolerated well . 
A foley catheter was also placed to bypass the bladder obstruction caused by the enlarged prostate . 
The catheter will remain in place until you follow up with the urology doctors . 
You will receive more information about the details of this appointment in the next couple of days . 
At the time of the appointment they will provide you with further instructions concerning the catheter and management of your large prostate . 
You were also started on Tamsulosin , a medication that will help to reduce the size of your prostate . 
Overall , your kidney function improved greatly with these interventions . 
Over the next several weeks it is very important that you stay well hydrated and drink lots of fluids . 
If you notice an increase in pain around the catheter , pain with urination , change in urine color , or fever please contact your PCP or return to the Emergency Room . 
We have arranged several follow - up appointments for you regarding your kidney function and enlarged prostate . 
These are listed below . 
We have made changes to your medications which are described below . 
The patient was evaluated for liver transplantation and was found to be a suitable candidate . 
He was placed on the waiting list . 
A suitable donor has become available , and the patient is now brought to the operating room after informed consent was obtained for orthotopic deceased donor liver transplant . 
One nodule ( 3 . 0 cm ) of moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma with features consistent with radiofrequency ablation effect . 
The tumor is predominantly ( > 9 5 % ) necrotic with rare microscopic foci of viable component . 
One focus of venous invasion seen is a portal vein away from the tumor . 
Trichrome stain evaluated . 
TECHNIQUE : The liver transplant was performed . 
The hepatic artery and its branches are patent . 
The hepatic veins are patent . 
No obvious fluid collections or free fluid is seen . 
IMPRESSION : Normal liver transplant ultrasound . 
Evaluate . 
COMPARISON : [ * * 2 1 7 4 - 7 - 1 2 * * ] . 
LIVER ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER EXAMINATION : The liver parenchyma is normal in echogenicity , without focal nodules or masses . 
A new 2 . 9 x 1 . 1 x 1 . 4 cm echogenic nodule is seen within the region of the excluded donor IVC most consistent with thrombus . 
Superior extension to the recipient IVC anastomosis is not clearly identified , and follow - up imaging is recommended . 
The adjacent recipient IVC is patent . 
The right , middle , and left hepatic veins demonstrate normal direction of flow and respiratory variation . 
The main , posterior right , anterior right , and left portal veins are patent , with appropriate direction of flow . 
The main , right , and left hepatic arteries demonstrate normal systolic upstroke with resistive indices measuring 0 . 8 3 , 0 . 7 2 , and 0 . 8 3 , respectively . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
Normal liver Doppler study . 
New thrombus within excluded donor IVC . 
Proximal extension into the recipient IVC is not clearly defined , and follow - up imaging is recommended for further evaluation . 
No fatty change or features of preservation / ischemic injury are seen . 
No features of acute cellular rejection are seen . 
Brief Hospital Course : Patient was taken to the operating room and underwent an orthotopic liver transplant ; the patient only required 1 unit of packed cells , 2 units of platelets , 5 0 0 - cc of albumin , and 1 unit of cryo intraop . 
He was taken to the APCU intubated and in stable condition . 
Patient did extremely well and was therefore extubated later that day ( ahead of the pathway ) . 
He stayed in the ICU for monitoring for another 2 4 hours , and was then transferred to the floor late on POD 1 . 
From here he made a remarkabel recovery . 
He continued to make good urine and LFTs went downward for the first few days . 
He ambulated with assitance and tolerated good po pretty early . 
Some hampering to his recovery was the fact that he is blind and somewhat deaf - he was continually claiming to be depressed because of boredom and lonliness . 
Duplex on POD 1 was normal , and CXRs continued to be normal . 
His CVL was removed before he left the ICU . 
On POD 5 his LFTs bumped up slightly , so he recieved 2 boluses of steroids as a precautionary measure and a repeat US was performed which showed a mural thrombus in the donor IVC . 
Biopsy was done which was normal and without signs of rejection . 
After that , LFTs started to decline again and patient continued to do extremely well . 
Labs every Monday & Thursday for cbc , chem 1 0 , ast , alt , alk phos , t . bili , albumin and trough prograf level . 
As per records , patient presented after her VNA noted medical non - compliance and apparent overuse of sedating medications and summoned EMS . 
When patient arrived at OSH , the patient was somewhat confused and hypoxic to high 8 0 ' s on 3 liters . 
Also tachycardic to 1 0 0 , tachypneic to mid 2 0 ' s and hypertensive to 1 6 0 ' s . 
She had low grade fevers to 9 9 . 
She was felt to be in congestive heart failure , was noted to have hyperkalemia , and apparently new renal failure with creatinine in 6 ' s . 
A central line was placed but then the patient became agitated , self - extracted the femoral line . 
Serial haldol , benadryl and ativan x 3 were not effective in sedating her and therefore the patient was intubated for airway protection . 
The femoral line was replaced . 
The patient had a NG tube placed , was given kayxelate , calcium gluconate , bicarb , insulin , and glucose for hyperkalemia , las well as lasix for CHF . 
She was given a dose of levoquin for UTI / possible pneumonia . 
The patient had an anion gap acidosis and there was concern for ethylene glycol because " urate crystals " were noted in the urine . 
She was noted to have coffee grounds by NGT . 
The patient was transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] ER .

Spleen , pancreas , adrenal glands are unremarkable . 
The right kidney is atrophic . 
The left kidney has some bulging of the contour at mid pole measuring about 1 . 6 cm .

She was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [ * * Hospital 1 1 8 * * ] . 
Course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis . 
Per family , patient lives alone and able to care for herself and perform activities of daily living . 
On admission , toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics , and by medical notes on transfer , patient had been using more sedating medications than normal . 
Neurology evaluated patient and vitamin B 1 2 and folate levels were normal . 
She received thiamine . 
TSH level was elevated to 8 and her T 4 was only very slightly below normal . 
Thus , thyroid function was not attributed to altered mental status . 
An EEG revealed encephalopathy , but no seizures . 
CT head revealed chronic small vessel disease . 
LP and MRI were deferred . 
She received Haldol and Ativan , which sedated her profoundly for several days . 
Then , after extubation , she began to have conversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times , poor attention and short term memory . 
She became febrile on [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 5 - 7 * * ] , which was concerning for a line infection , and was treated initially with Vanco / Zosyn changed to Vanco / Meropenem plan for 3 day course complete [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 5 - 9 * * ] . 
C . diff negative x 3 . 
Her head CT was unchanged . 
On [ * * 5 - 1 3 * * ] , patient had her PICC line and tunneled HD line placed and developed fevers within 1 2 hours . 
Only one blood culture from [ * * 5 - 1 4 * * ] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negative organisms . 
Treated with ten day course of vancomycin ( per HD protocol ) through [ * * 5 - 2 3 * * ] . 
As above , concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol cause profound sedation . 
She required soft wrist restraints for prevention of line removal . 
Pt was transferred to the MICU on [ * * 6 - 2 * * ] for respiratory compromise ( see below ) . 
Her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitation and anxiety which were hard to control . 
She perseverated on her medications , her course , and her dietary restrictions . 
Psych was consulted and attempted to help control these outbursts without using benzodiazepems . 
She often complained of dyspnea , but requested ativan as treatment . 
She was transferred to the MICU for low O 2 saturation , where she was diuresed for congestive heart failure / volume overload . 
She was transferred back to the floor on [ * * 6 - 1 5 * * ] , where she continued to be anxious and take off her O 2 mask . 
Psych recommended continuing standing haldol as well as 1 0 0 mg neurontin qhs . 
Benzodiazepines were avoided . 
This combination had a calming effect and the patient was significantly less agitated without being over - sedated , thought to be back to her baseline mental status . 
Remained at baseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization . 
At home , she requires 4 L nasal canula . 
Patient has history of COPD , CHF , and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes . 
Intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failure contributed to hypoxemic event . 
No clear pneumonia . 
Patient was aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis . 
She was extubated on [ * * 5 - 7 * * ] . 
Hypoxia seems out of proportion to edema demonstrated on imaging . 
TTE was negative for patent foramen ovale . 
On [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 6 - 1 * * ] , the patient triggered for hypoxia 6 8 % on 6 liters ( the patient formerly had been 9 0 - 9 2 % on 6 liters . 
On recheck , the O 2 sat was 8 8 % and then 9 0 - 9 1 % on 6 liters without intervention . 
The patient was scheduled to have HD as scheduled on [ * * 2 1 6 7 - 6 - 2 * * ] . 
At HD , the HD catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning . 
TPA was tried without success . 
Then , the patient was found to be hypoxic to 7 5 % at HD with ABG 7 . 5 3 / 2 6 / 4 4 0 on a 4 0 % venti mask . 
On a NRB , the patient ' s saturations improved to 9 7 % and a repeat gas was 7 / 5 3 / 2 7 / 5 8 . 
The patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness of breath was not acute in onset but had been developing over the past few days . 
However , her SBP was noted to be 1 8 8 - 2 1 6 during HD and the patient was given her am BP meds as a result . 
CXR indicated volume overload and pt . 
Pt was transferred to MICU and had temporary femoral HD line initially placed , then tunneled HD line placed by IR [ * * 6 - 3 * * ] . 
She had 7 L removed during MICU course with improvement of oxygenation and was sent back to floor [ * * 6 - 5 * * ] . 
While on the floor she was maintained on 6 L of NC . 
She did occasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety , however it was hard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues , as she was often breathing at a normal rate and sat ' ing in the mid 9 0 s while complaining . 
She generally maintained saturations from 8 8 - 9 5 % . 
She did have at least two desat ' s into the low 8 0 s at night , but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldol without changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen . 
On [ * * 6 - 9 * * ] she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion after her Haldol had been increased to 2 mg / dose and her NC O 2 dropped to 4 L . 
She was transferred again to the MICU at that point , and again was diuresed aggressively with good result . 
Repeat TTE again showed no patent foramen ovale / shunt . 
CTA was negative for PE . 
She was transferred back to the floor on [ * * 6 - 1 5 * * ] , where she continued to required 6 - 8 L O 2 and occasionally desat ' d in setting of anxiety . 
An echo [ * * 6 - 1 9 * * ] showed evidence of worsening CHF ( EF 3 0 % now , was > 5 5 % in [ * * Month ( only ) * * ] ) , which would explain continued increased oxygen requirement and SOB , with evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR . 
In conjunction with the renal team , the patient required almost daily HD or ultrafiltration to draw off fluid . 
Attempts were made with medications to balance the need for afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure which could tolerate volume loss through dialysis . 
This primarily involved decreasing the patient ' s betablocker and verapamil dose significantly , while maintaining isosorbide nitrate . 
The patient was witnessed several times eating high salty foods , and being non - compliant with the fluid restriction which complicated attempts to manage her volume status . 
With aggressive HD , as well as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation ( above ) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baseline requirement of 4 L O 2 on nasal cannula . 
Outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4 . 0 in [ * * Month ( only ) 9 5 8 * * ] [ * * 2 1 6 6 * * ] . 
On admission , anuric . 
She was hyperkalemic , so initially received kayxelate , calcium gluconate , insulin , and bicarbonated . 
No ECG changes . 
Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction . 
Received aggressive hemodialysis sessions . 
There was concern that tunneled dialysis line infected , but as she was not rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotension except when on dialysis , believed that filter on hemodialysis machine may have caused adverse reaction . 
Asaghi filter used on [ * * 5 - 2 2 * * ] with good effect . 
Management of the patient ' s volume status was complicated by dietary noncompliance and aggitation . 
After requiring 2 MICU transfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation from pulmonary edema , we were finally able to dialyze her sufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement . 
We monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her the importance of dietary compliance . 
Adding neurontin to her anxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliant with our management strategy and was less likely to take off her oxygen support . 
Renal recommends performing a 2 4 hour urine collection after one month to re - evaluate her renal status . 
As outpatient , on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace - inhibitor . 
ECG without ischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative . 
Continued aspirin and added beta blocker . 
As anuric , removed excess fluid with hemodialysis . 
Started on beta blockade . 
Started amlodipine , metoprolol , and isorbide . 
Goal blood pressure < 1 7 0 , but due to longstanding hypertension , developed worsened mental status when blood pressures less than 1 4 0 . 
Most likely due to hypoperfusion . 
In setting of hypotensive episodes during dialysis , held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis . 
Over the course of hospitalization , we adjusted her bp medications according to what was tolerated during dialysis . 
On discharge , she is taking isosorbide mononitrate 3 0 mg SR and toprol XL 1 0 0 mg q day . 
Coffee grounds in NGT but this was in setting of supratherapeutic INR . 
Subsequently resolved status post reversal of INR . 
Treated with IV ( and then po ) protonix . 
Her serial hematocrits remained stable . 
Abdominal CT on [ * * 5 - 1 * * ] unremarkable . 
Diverticulosis was noted on subsequent abdominal CT ( as above ) . 
Completed seven day course on [ * * 5 - 5 * * ] . 
Shortly after discontinuation of antibiotics , was transiently febrile , so started meropenem and vancomycin on [ * * 5 - 7 * * ] for 3 day course . 
PICC line was placed and tunneled HD line placed on [ * * 5 - 1 3 * * ] . 
Febrile shortly after line placed ( 1 / 4 bottles with staph coagulase negative ) , so started ten day course of vancomycin that was completed on [ * * 5 - 2 3 * * ] . 
New PICC placed [ * * 6 - 3 * * ] for antibiotics and question of infection . 
On [ * * 6 - 1 7 * * ] ID was consulted for rising leukocytosis . 
Bacillus species grew from [ * * 6 - 1 9 * * ] PICC blood cx , pt was started on cefepime for bacteremia on [ * * 6 - 2 0 * * ] ( initial culture result said GNR ) and PICC was d / c ' d . 
Was discovered on [ * * 6 - 2 3 * * ] that bacillus likely was a contaminant . 
Pt has been afebrile , but given persistently high WBC , there was concern for infection or other etiology . 
C . Diff was negative . 
Antibiotics were discontinued on [ * * 6 - 2 3 * * ] given no organism isolated and patient being afebrile . 
Subsequent culture from [ * * 6 - 2 4 * * ] showed no growth to date . 
Can consider other cause of leukocytosis : patient was not on systemic steroids so that is unlikely to be a cause . 
Patient had mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules , which could suggest a malignant cause . 
Recommend working up malignancy as outpatient given that patient is clinically stable and would benefit from rehab placement . 
Restarted during hospitalization , but discontinued , per psychiatry , on [ * * 5 - 2 2 * * ] . 
Tunneled hemodialysis catheter placed on [ * * 5 - 1 3 * * ] . 
PICC placed [ * * 6 - 3 * * ] , removed [ * * 6 - 2 1 * * ] . 
Speech and swallow evaluation on [ * * 5 - 1 8 * * ] cleared patient for thin liquids and pureed solids . 
Aspiration precautions . 
Eventually advanced to regular renal diet . 
Occasionally was hyponatremic , thought due to excess free water ingestion . 
Was kept on fluid restriction 1 L / day , with varying effect as patient would sometimes obtain water / fluids when the nurse was not looking . 
Most likely result of drug reaction . 
Potentially vancomycin . 
Started on hydrocortisone cream , sarna lotion , and triamcinolone cream . 
Resolved . 
Pt also noted to have intragluteal irritation with sattelite lesions , likely yeast infection . 
Started on miconazole powder . 
Confirmed with daughter .

History of Present Illness : 5 6 yo male with a history of DM 2 , CAD s / p CABG , peripheral vascular disease , and prior history of chronic lymphedema was admitted on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 8 - 1 6 * * ] for LLE cellulitis . 
His left lower extremity lymphedema started after vascular surgery in [ * * 2 2 0 5 * * ] ( L SFA to anterior tibial bypass graft ) . 
Left leg is extremely painful . 
More recently he has been on his feet more , which has been causing worsening edema and pain . 
He has occasional serous drainage from left leg . 
Single , lives with sister who is bipolar and reportedly refuses to allow VNA into house . 
No open areas Left BKA Incision : clean and dry . 
No reddness , drainage . 
Brief Hospital Course : 5 6 year old man with a history of chronic L > R painful lymphedema was admitted to the hospital on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 8 - 1 6 * * ] with severe cellulitis which we treated with aggressive ACE wrap and elevation , IV antibiotics and IV diuresis . 
Despite antibiotics ( vanco , cipro , flagyl and zosyn ) his WBC continues to rise with low grade temps . 
He also developed a new erythema over trunk so ID was consulted on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 8 - 2 0 * * ] . 
His antibiotics were discontinued and he was started on ceftaroline . 
His cellulitis and rash slowly improved though his unremitting pain in his LLE continued to persist . 
After discussion with palliative care , chronic pain services and Dr . [ * * Last Name ( STitle ) * * ] , the decision was made to go forward with a Left BKA to improve Mr . [ * * Known lastname 3 6 5 1 5 * * ] quality of life which was performed ( guillotine ) on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 8 - 2 3 * * ] . 
At this point , his antibiotic was then changed to Linezolid . 
He returned to the OR on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 8 - 2 8 * * ] for Re - amputation and closure of left below - knee amputation . 
Post operatively in the PACU , he required a brief reintubation secondary to hypoxia . 
His CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema . 
He was monitored overnight in the CVICU then transferred to the floor . 
On the floor , he has made steady progress . 
He has remained afebrile with baseline renal function and hemodynamically stable . 
He has worked with PT who recommended rehab . 
In terms of his medications : - We weaned his oxycontin from 4 0 mg / day to 3 0 mg / day on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 9 - 1 * * ] . 
He is due to have it decreased again on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 9 - 3 * * ] . 
Since the BKA he has had minimal pain .

Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery . 
You will be given a new prescription for pain medication to be taken if necessary . 
We restarted your coumadin on [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 9 - 1 * * ] . 
Your PCP will manage your coumadin when you are discharged to home . 
We have also decreased your pain medications . 
You were taking 2 0 mg twice daily of oxycontin prior to admission . 
On [ * * 2 2 0 7 - 9 - 1 * * ] , we decreased you oxycontin to 2 0 mg in the AM and 1 0 mg at night . 
They will continue to wean this medication at rehab as tolerated .

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy . 
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small . 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal . 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal ( LVEF > 5 5 % ) .

No evidence of acute focal pneumonia . 
Brief Hospital Course : [ * * Age over 9 0 * * ] year old female with past medical history significant for CAD , critical AS , and radiation proctitis presenting after a fall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates . 
The etiologies for her hypotension were thought to be related to pain - medications and critical AS . 
Patient was given gental IV fluid boluses after being admitted to CCU . 
Patient ' s blood pressure continued to be low , systolics in the 6 0 s and 7 0 s , during the rest of her hospital stay . 
Pressors were avoided given her severe AS . 
Because of hypotension , she developed acute renal failure rapidly ( creatinine bumped from 0 . 9 to 2 . 9 in 2 days ) . 
Patient declined hemodialysis , also denied AVR or valvuloplasty , so after extensive discussions with patient ' s HCP ( her son , [ * * Name ( NI ) * * ] [ * * Name ( NI ) 1 0 1 6 6 * * ] ) , decision was made to make patient comfort measures only . 
She expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renal failure and electrolyte abnormalities . 
She underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis ( valve area < 0 . 8 cm 2 ) . 
She declined AVR or valvuloplasty . 
She expired on [ * * 2 1 4 6 - 2 - 2 * * ] in the setting of critical AS , hypotension and acute renal failure . 
Patient ' s creatinine was 0 . 9 on admission , likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry . 
No recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins , and no symptoms of UTI with benign UA . 
Patient was hypotensive during her hospital stay . 
As a result , her kidney function deteriorated rapidly . 
Her creatinine bumped to 2 . 9 on day 3 . 
Patient declined hemodialysis , so she was made comfort measures only after all medical options to keep her alive failed . 
On the morning of her expiration , her K was 5 . 4 , and she was not producing urine . 
She passed at 1 9 0 0 that day . 
It is therefore very likely that she died of hyperkalemia . 
On telemetry , she went into brief VT followed by asystole minutes before her demise . 
The most concerning possibility was that patient ' s AS led to syncope due to hypoperfusion . 
Unfortunately , as the fall was unwitnessed and the patient did not remember what happened this was impossible to prove . 
Patient underwent a repeat TTE which showed critical aortic valve stenosis ( valve area < 0 . 8 cm 2 ) . 
Therefore , it was certainly very likely that AS played a role in the fall . 
Ortho decided to manage conservatively with sling and analgesia . 
Pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock , lidocaine patch , and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimize effect on blood pressure . 
Patient ' s pain was well - controlled on the above regimen . 
She was not on aspirin or coumadin because of a previous GI bleed . 
Metoprolol was held given her hypotension . 
Patient was observed on telemetry during her hospital stay in CCU . 
She went into VT followed by asystole minutes before she expired , likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure . 
Cultures were negative , including blood cx , urine cx and c . diff . 
Patient was not started on antibiotics since she had no sign of infection . 
Her hct was 4 3 . 6 on admission , likely hemoconcentrated . 
Hct decreased to her baseline of 2 9 during the next two days . 
She had no signs of active bleeding . 
Patient was not on ASA or statin ( lipids normal ) . 
Patient had some cardiac enzyme leaks during her hospital stay , likely in the setting of hypotension and decreased blood supply to coronaries .

LABORATORY EVALUATION : His testosterone level on AndroGel is normal at 2 9 2 mg / dL ( normal 1 9 5 - 1 1 3 8 ) on 0 9 / 1 3 / 2 1 7 1 . 
His hematocrit is 3 9 . 
It was 3 7 in 0 2 / 2 1 7 1 . . Platelets are 1 7 9 , 0 0 0 . 
White count 4 . 8 . 
In summary , Mr . Heath is a 7 6 - year - old man with osteoporosis and compression fractures probably secondary to hypogonadism and therapy for esophageal cancer . 
The cause of hypogonadism is probably the chemotherapy . 
I asked him again to see a urologist to rule out other causes of primary hypogonadism . 
He will continue the current treatment with calcium , vitamin D , testosterone and antiresorptive therapy of his yearly zoledronic acid . 
We will repeat a BMD in 2 years from now .

He is a 7 2 - year - old man with CAD S / P diagnostic cath one week ago at SCMHC , found to have a moderately tight lesion in the LAD without significant disease in the left circumflex or RCA . 
Because of the recent onset of angina and a stress test showing anterior ischemia , he was brought to ECI , where Dr . Yoseph Flint stented the LAD lesion with a 3 . 5 mm by 3 2 mm Taxus drug - eluting stent , with zero percent residual . 
The right femoral arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal , and there were no complications . 
He spent an uneventful evening without complaints , ambulating without difficulty . 
His left groin was soft without hematoma or bruit , and extremities were warm and well perfused . 
Morning labs included a BUN of 1 7 , creatinine 0 . 9 , hematocrit 3 7 , platelets 2 3 6 , 0 0 0 , and flat cardiac enzymes .

Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care . 
Please call if you have questions . 
As you know , Mr . Dejesus is a very pleasant 7 4 - year - old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who is on Coumadin . 
He has a history of insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus , hypertension and dyslipidemia . 
He has known coronary artery disease and underwent stenting of his left anterior descending artery in 0 5 / 2 1 5 5 , at which time he had a Taxus drug - eluting stent placed . 
He returns now with increasing dyspnea on exertion and had an elective cardiac catheterization performed at the Southwest Colorado Medical on 0 7 / 1 3 / 2 1 5 7 that showed focal 9 0 % instent restenosis in the left anterior descending artery with no other focally occlusive disease . 
He was transferred to the Erie County Infirmary and on the afternoon of 0 7 / 1 6 / 2 1 5 7 , Dr . Yoseph Flint was able to dilate and stent the lesion in the left anterior descending artery with placement of a 3 . 5 x 2 8 mm Cypher drug - eluting stent . 
The procedure was complicated by brief transient no re - flow that resolved immediately to intracoronary nitroglycerin . 
The left femoral arteriotomy was closed using an Angio - Seal device . 
Mr . Dejesus has spent an uneventful evening on our Cardiovascular Service . 
He has had no complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath . 
He is ambulating , eating , and voiding without difficulty . 
His heart rate has been in the 7 0 s , blood pressure in the 1 1 0 s / 6 0 . 
He is in atrial fibrillation . 
His cardiac exam was irregular with no appreciable murmur . 
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
His left groin is moderately ecchymotic but soft . 
There is no hematoma or bruit . 
Extremities are warm and well perfused . 
His morning labs revealed a sodium of 1 3 8 , potassium of 4 . 9 , BUN of 2 1 , creatinine of 1 . 2 . 
His total CK is 5 8 with a CK - MB of 0 . 4 . 
His hematocrit is stable at 3 8 , white count of 9 , platelets of 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . 
His fasting lipid panel showed a total cholesterol 1 2 3 with an HDL of 2 5 , LDL of 4 9 , and triglycerides of 2 4 4 . 
He will resume his Coumadin at 5 mg daily , and have this checked with his primary care physician , Dr . Paige . 
He will be on Lipitor 2 0 mg p . o . 
We have asked him to arrange a followup appointment with you within the next couple of weeks and to see Robert - Joseph Paige in the near future also . 
Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman , and please do not hesitate to contact us with any issues regarding his ongoing management . 
With warmest regards . 
As you know him well , I will summarize his history briefly for our records . 
Mr . Dejesus is a 7 8 - year - old gentleman with an extensive cardiac history that includes coronary artery disease status post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions and stents to the LAD as well as RCA territories , a cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately 3 5 - 4 0 % , and atrial fibrillation . 
In addition , he has multiple cardiac risk factors including diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , and obstructive sleep apnea . 
In addition to disease in his coronary vascular bed , he has a history of carotid disease status post left CEA . 
He came to your attention early this year with symptoms of exertional dyspnea . 
On further questioning , he reports feeling quite symptomatic when ambulating relatively short distances around his home or up and down the driveway . 
He can walk no further than approximately 5 0 - 1 0 0 feet before developing significant shortness of breath and fatigue . 
He was recently diagnosed as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that has transitioned to persistent . 
He has undergone multiple cardioversions most recently in 0 3 / 1 9 / 2 1 6 1 , but was unsuccessful . 
Prior to that , cardioversion in February resulted in a brief period of restoration of sinus rhythm during which time he felt symptomatically improved . 
He also describes occasional fleeting episodes of sharp left - sided chest discomfort . 
Cardiac catheterization on 0 1 / 1 8 / 2 1 6 1 revealed a 3 0 % LAD in - stent restenosis , 9 0 % septal lesion , and 6 5 % - 7 0 % PDA lesion that was stented . 
A Ventriculogram at that time revealed an EF of 3 5 - 4 0 % . 
Other than significant exertional shortness of breath , he feels relatively well . 
He has occasional symptoms of orthostatic lightheadedness but no history of syncope . 
He denies any PND , orthopnea , or lower extremity swelling . 
He has no history of heart failure hospitalizations . 
His weight has been stable . 
On review of systems , he denies any fevers , chills , or night sweats . 
His weight has remained stable . 
He denies any new onset cough , wheezing , or hemoptysis . 
CAD status post LAD PCI / stenting in 2 1 5 5 . 
He developed in - stent restenosis in 0 7 / 2 1 5 7 , during which time he received a second drug - eluting stent to the LAD lesion . 
He developed recurrent chest discomfort in 1 2 / 2 1 5 9 , and he underwent cardiac catheterization during which time he was found to have an 8 0 % mid LAD lesion distal to his prior stents as well as a 3 0 % proximal RCA mid PDA stenosis . 
He underwent a drug - eluting stent to the mid LAD lesion . 
A followup catheterization in 0 1 / 2 1 6 1 revealed a 3 0 % LAD stenosis , 9 0 % large septal branch lesion , and a 6 5 - 7 0 % proximal PDA stenosis . 
Ventriculogram revealed an EF of 3 5 - 4 0 % . 
He underwent stenting to the PDA lesion on 0 3 / 0 6 / 2 1 6 1 . 
An exercise Myoview performed in 0 1 / 2 1 6 0 revealed no evidence of inducible ischemia . 
Hypertension . 
Dyslipidemia . 
Diabetes . 
Obstructive sleep apnea . 
COPD , prescribed home oxygen , though he is not taking this . 
Carotid disease , status post left CEA after presenting with an ipsilateral episode of amaurosis fugax . 
History of BLANK AAA by ultrasound in 0 7 / 2 1 5 9 . 
Atrial fibrillation . 
Obesity . 
He has no known drug allergies . 
His current medications include amiodarone 2 0 0 mg BLANK , but this has been discontinued since April , metoprolol 5 0 mg b . i . d . , digoxin 0 . 2 5 mg daily , Zocor 2 0 mg daily , Plavix 7 5 mg daily , TriCor 1 4 5 mg daily , Lasix 2 0 mg daily , BLANK 5 mg nightly , aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily , Lantus insulin 6 2 units daily , Humalog insulin , and Protonix 4 0 mg daily . 
His social history is notable for remote history of tobacco dependence . 
He was formally employed in buidling construction . 
He has multiple environmental exposures including insulation as well as spray paint and without respiratory protection . 
He does not currently smoke or drink alcohol . 
His family history is negative for early onset CAD , sudden cardiac death , or cardiomyopathy . 
His father lived until the age of 8 8 . 
His mother died of a stroke at the age of 8 0 . 
He has a single sister who is 8 6 years of age and has no history of heart troubles . 
In general , he is overweight elderly man in no distress . 
Sitting upright his jugular venous pressure is below the clavicles . 
Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally . 
Lungs are notable for a few crackles at the bases , but otherwise clear . 
There is no wheezing . 
Cardiac exam reveals an irregular rate with a variable S 1 and S 2 . 
There is no audible murmur , rub or gallop . 
Abdomen is obese , soft , and nontender . 
Lower extremities are warm and well perfused . 
There is trace pitting edema at the ankles . 
Recent blood work reveals an INR of 2 . 2 on 0 5 / 2 8 / 2 1 6 1 . 
EKG today reveals atrial fibrillation at a rate of approximately 6 6 beats per minute . 
There are some nonspecific T - wave abnormalities , but otherwise no evidence of prior infarct or ST changes . 
There is some low voltage in the limb leads , though I suspect this is related to his habitus . 
Overall , Mr . Dejesus is a pleasant 7 8 - year - old man with a complex prior medical history who appears to have persistent atrial fibrillation with a principal functional limitation of exertional shortness of breath . 
He appears to be functional class III . 
He does not have any frank evidence of volume overload on exam today , though his ventricular function and is not entirely normal . 
Moreover , he has multiple comorbidities which may exacerbate his exertional dyspnea including COPD and coronary artery disease . 
We discussed atrial fibrillation with Mr . Dejesus and his family today . 
We explained that the brief period of normal sinus rhythm associated with symptomatic improvement may be a reason to proceed with catheter ablation . 
However , given his comorbidities and the presence of persistent arrhythmia we warned that a single catheter ablation procedure may not be entirely successful and that waiting period of approximately 3 - 4 month post - ablation may be required to adjudicate success . 
Given the length of the procedure as well as his comorbidities , we feel reasonable to consult with our anesthesia colleagues for possible consideration of performing the procedure under general anesthesia versus with MAC and had procedural sedation . 
We will leave this decision to them . 
Moreover , prior to the ablation , we will request a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out left atrial clot prior to ablation . 
Thank you very much for referring Mr . Dejesus to our care . 
We will be in touch following the procedure . 
As always , feel free to call with any questions . 
He was started on Carvedilol and Spironolactone during that visit . 
He was aggressively diuresed with marked improvement in his symptoms . 
Beta blocker was reduced during that admission as well . 
Most recent echo from 5 / 0 2 / 8 8 showed severely depressed LV systolic function , EF 3 0 % , global hypokinesis with antero - apical akinesis . 
Moderate LV margin . 
Mild concentric LVH and mild L atrial enlargement ( 4 1 mm . ) . 
Dilated aortic loop . 
Normal RV size and function . 
Mild aortic insufficiency and trace MR . 
He is now doing exceedingly well on his current regimen and denies any symptoms of SOB , orthopnea or pedal edema . 
He continues to be followed regularly by regularly by Dr . Cook for his ischemic cardiomyopathy / CHF . 
Based on this , he was admitted to MCH and underwent cardiac catheterization . 
Notably , his cath also revealed a dominant RCA which was occluded proximately and was collateralized from the LAD , which was supplied by the L internal mammary artery . 
The L main had no significant lesions . 
The LAD had a 5 0 % lesion just before the first diagonal and the mid - LAD was occluded . 
He was discharged the following day without complications . 
Although his current activity level is somewhat limited by his DJD ( see below ) , he is exercising regularly in the pool and he currently denies any symptoms of angina . 
Continues follow - up with Dr . Whitlock / Cook .

FOUND TO BE IN VT , HAD RECURRENT VT . 
TRANSFERRED TO MCH AND UNDERWENT CABG AND AICD 2 / 7 7 . 
He has not seen a podiatrist regularly and I have encouraged him to begin this process . 
Will check FBS , HBA 1 C and urine for microalbumin today . 
We will check fasting lipids and LFT ' s today . 
As noted above , a 2 4 - hour urine recently revealed 6 gm of protein . 
He is on new maximal doses of ACEI ' s . 
SIG . 
HE HAD A SINUS OPENING IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR PERIANAL AREA . 
HE FELT THAT TO FULLY EVALUATE THIS TO SEE WHETHER IT WAS AN ANAL FISTULA OR A PILONIDAL CYST THAT EXAM UNDER ANESTHESIA WITH UNROOFING OF THE LESION WAS INDICATED . 
PT SO FAR HAS DECLINED THIS , BUT WILL LET DR . JENSON KNOW IF HE RECONSIDERS . 
CURRENTLY HE IS WILLING TO LIVE WITH HIS SYMPTOMS . 
It has now gotten to the point where it limits his ability to walk , so that he can only " limp less than a block " and has difficulty with stairs . 
Given that he has done well from a cardiac standpoint since his admissions in the spring , he is interested in pursuing a L TKR replacement if Cardiology feels it would be feasible . 
Will refer him to Dr . Robles for initial evaluation . 
Apparently he is scheduled for a repeat study before he follows up with Dr . Cook . 
He is S / P R cerebellar CVA back in ' 8 0 and has had stable minor neurologic deficits since that time and currently denies any new neurologic symptoms .

Opal Fierro , M . D . 
PROBLEMS : 1 . 
Status post removal of infected AICD and pacer . 
Admitted to Massillon Community 1 2 / 9 1 with infection of his AICD and permanent pacer . 
He was managed by multiple services including EP , Cardiology , and ID . 
His OR cultures grew candida and he was treated with a prolonged course of fluconazole . 
Although he had runs of NSVT , he was managed effectively with carvedilol . 
Notably his digoxin was stopped because of bradycardia during the hospitalization . 
He never had any sustained VT or VF . 
He was subsequently discharged home with a Life vest defibrillator . 
He has done well with no recurrent evidence of infection . 
He currently has no AICD or pacemaker but saw Dr . Cook yesterday and apparently he is being evaluated for new hardware for his arrhythmia issues . 
He has a history of both VF arrest and sick sinus syndrome . 
Currently his heart rate is slightly irregular but a reasonable rate and he will continue on his current regimen as prescribed by Dr . Cook with close follow up . 
CHF . 
Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization , he went directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him . 
He had one episode of CHF , which was managed as an outpatient , and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously . 
At the present time , he has no active symptoms of CHF , he continues to sleep on two large pillows at night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema . 
He does continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix . 
Coronary artery disease . 
Despite all of his active issues , he has no current symptoms of angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well . 
Status post infected ( staph ) left knee arthroplasty . 
His left TKR also required removal due to infection and he had replacement of new hardware by Dr . Judd 1 0 / 9 1 . 
He has had no recurrent infection , but his rehabilitation has been more limited because of his other medical issues . 
He does report that he was swimming in the pool and doing things on his own while down in West Virginia , but we will make a formal rehab referral now that he is back in the Mexico area . 
Diabetes mellitus . 
Throughout his numerous medical problems over the past six to twelve months , he has had a significant weight loss and not surprisingly , his diabetes regimen has been gradually decreased . 
He is now on Glyburide 5 mg b . i . d . 
He has no complaints of hypoglycemia or blood sugars greater than 2 0 0 . 
We will check his HbA 1 c today and continue his current regimen . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
He continues on Lipitor . 
We ' ll recheck his fasting lipids , LFTs and CPK . 
Diabetic nephropathy . 
He remains on ACE inhibitor and will check renal function today to re - establish baseline . 
Status post CVA . 
Known moderate right carotid stenosis . 
Minimal residual dysarthria and right - sided weakness . 
Has had no recent neurologic symptoms and remains on Coumadin . 
Was unable to get sufficient blood pressure by cuff . 
Pulse 6 0 , mostly irregular . 
General , thin , but no distress . 
Lungs , clear to auscultation and percussion . 
Cor , distant heart sounds . 
No S 3 appreciated . 
Old pacer / AICD site . 
No evidence of erythema or fluctuance . 
Extremities , trace edema bilaterally . 
At this time , he was quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy . 
He did deny abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today . 
At this point , my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and send in to me by mail . 
I have also sent off a CBC today . 
I will plan to repeat urinalysis at his next visit . 
If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool , then we will need to discuss more aggressive work - up , but given his overall health condition , I do not feel the need to be aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first . 
Admitted MCH 8 / 2 9 through 9 / 9 / 9 2 . 
Treated by Dr . Randall . 
Will recheck renal function today . 
Will need to monitor closely through rehab . 
CHF : he had been on 8 0 b . i . d . 
Will go back to 8 0 b . i . d . 
Hypertension : with diuresis and weight loss , his BP is running low . 
Close VNA follow up . 
COPD : doing well despite recent surgery . 
Continues to use Combivent inhaler p . r . n . 
For now , he is on vitamins and iron supplements as his bowels tolerate . 
Review of systems : constipation related to the iron . 
Generally weak . 
Social history : wife very involved with his care . 
Physical exam : BP 9 8 / 6 0 . 
Pulse 6 4 . 
No rub . 
Abdomen : mildly distended , nontender . 
Multiple well healed surgical scars . 
Extremities : incisions in the groin . 
No erythema . 
Soft , nontender , non - erythematous . 
Dry gangrene left second toe . 
Disposition : 1 . 
Increase Lasix to 8 0 b . i . d . 
Temporarily hold lisinopril given low BP . 
Continue Percocet for toe pain . 
Follow up with Dr . Randall who needs to assess the cystic mass in his right groin . 
Will continue to work with insurance to try to obtain Epogen . 
Add Lexapro 1 0 mg 1 p . o .

Briefly , Pt is a 5 9 yo man with the following CV risk factors : smoker , HTN who presents with L sided chest pain and found to have inf STEMI no w s / p baremetal stent x 3 placement awaiting repeat catherization for L Circ PCI . 
Post cath he was chest pain free with resolution of his STE . 
At cath , he was loaded with plavix at cath and received integrillin . 
Presently , plan ( per cardiology ) is for repeat cath for PCI of L circ . 
LDL was 8 4 , on 8 0 mg QD lipitor . 
Pt did not demonstrate evidence of volume overload . 
Information System . 
All updates should originate in EDIS . 
He took NTG and this > no change . 
He is certain were assocaited with post - meals . 
Currently no SOB . 
Some relief with antacids . 
Hx DVT . 
HTN , elev lipids . 
ROS and PFSHx as noted above and in the ED record for this encounter . 
All other systems otherwise negative . 
Patient is alert . 
Patient is oriented x 3 . 
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
ETT is planned and pending . 
Presents with chest ache . 
EKG no acute change 2 sets of markers neg will be admitted to the EDOU for ETT . 
Known risk factors at that time ( in addition to his age and gender ) were Hypertension and tobacco smoking . 
Details of that presentation as per my 1 2 / 1 6 / 3 4 office note . 
Emergent catheterization showed three areas of severe stenosis in the RCA territory , one in the ditsal RCA and two in the PLV . 
The PLV lesions each received 2 . 5 x 1 5 mm Minivision ( bare metal stents ) and the distal RCA lesion received a 3 . 5 x 1 5 mm Vision ( bare metal stent ) . 
A non - dominant Left Circumflex had a 7 0 % stenosis that was not intervened upon . 
There was non - obstructive disease in the LAD . 
A transthoracic echo showed an LV EF of 5 4 % and no wall motion abnormalities . 
Left atrium was slightly dilated to 3 9 mm . 
RV function was normal . 
He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program ( see below ) . 
He had an outpatient ETT - MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease . 
He had this on 1 2 / 0 7 / 3 4 and he exercised for 6 minutes , 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 7 0 % of predicted . 
He did not experience chest pain , had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue . 
The images showed inferior and apical thinning without ischemia . 
LV EF 6 3 % . 
He had a recurrent episode of chest pain ( somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like ) and presented to the ED in March . 
His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT - MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 1 0 sec , achieving 9 METS , 8 0 % MPHR , peak double product 1 9 K . 
A different type of chest pain occurrred during the study and was not study - limiting . 
The ECG was negative for ischemia and the perfusion images were normal , without evidence of ischemia or infarction . 
LV EF 6 8 % . 
He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI . 
He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab . 
He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI , and has remained abstinent since then . 
He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath . 
His overall activity is at times limited due to ankylosing spondylitis and associated pain . 
Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain . 
This occurs in his left chest and lasts hours at a time . 
Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG . 
He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work , and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities ( i . e . 
He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath , which has not changed since the onset of the CP . 
He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI , and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test . 
He denies lightheadedness or syncope . 
No orthopnea or lower extremity swelling . 
He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen . 
He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy . 
He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes . 
Given that the main treatment plan at this time for his ankylosing spondylitis is NSAIDs ( i . e . 
Motrin ) , he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point . 
He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 8 1 mg daily , Lipitor 2 0 mg daily , Toprol XL 2 5 mg daily and Lisinopril 1 0 mg daily . 
His heart rate and blood pressure are well controlled . 
The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT - MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images . 
He does have a known 7 0 % stenosis in a non - dominant LCx , but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory . 
His ECG today is unchanged from priors . 
However , given his history we will be vigilant for any change or persistence in symptoms . 
I will call the patient in several days time , and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT . 
His LDL has been well controlled however his HDL has been very low on several readings . 
Given this , along with an elevated TG value , we will start Niaspan . 
He can start with 5 0 0 mg qhs for the first 2 - 3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects ( i . e . 
He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 3 0 minutes before to help minimize side effects . 
After a few weeks , he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1 0 0 0 mg qhs . 
He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward . 
He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level . 
He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure . 
So , no further testing at this point . 
He will call me if symptoms recur . 
He has occasional fleeting chest pain but never sustained and nothing in the past 1 - 2 months . 
He awoke this AM with dull left chest pain which has persisted throughout the day . 
Pain was 6 / 1 0 at worst , unchanged with exertion and similar in quality ( albeit less intense ) to pain during STEMI . 
No associated SOB , nausea , diaphoresis or radiation . 
Given the CP persistance , he presented to the ER . 
Initial ECGs showed sinus brady with a relatively normal tracing ; no acute ischemic changes and no significant change from prior . 
After a combination of 4 SL nitro , IV nitro , IV heparin and morphine ( 2 mg IV x 2 ) , the CP eventually subsided . 
Currently , he is CP free and resting comfortably . 
At baseline , he doesn ' t exercise formally but he has 3 flights of stairs at home and he ' s able to climb them without exertional symptoms . 
Also , he was previously on therapy for GERD but stopped taking prilosec several months ago . 
Some features are concerning for angina ( similar to prior symptoms , some improvement with nitro . . . ) , whereas other aspects are less concerning ( prolonged CP without ECG changes or biomarker leak ) . 
Overall , doubt ACS .

On 1 / 3 1 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2 0 7 3 : pain in back of left neck , left shoulder , and left arm . 
As a result he did not exercise that day . 
The symptoms improved spontaneously . 
On 2 / 0 1 he did his normal exercise routine , running on the treadmill for 4 0 minutes ; he felt fine . 
Later that day , he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr . Ishmael ' s answering service . 
Dr . Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED . 
He is very impressed that Dr . Patterson saw him that evening in the ED . 
There EKG showed no changes but troponin - I and CK screen were positive . 
He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin . 
When second set of enzymes was positive on 2 / 0 2 he went to cath lab , where old RCA stent was " pristine , " LAD showed stable 5 0 % lesion , but distal LCx showed 9 0 % lesion . 
He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent , producing excellent result . 
He was discharged on 2 / 0 3 on plavix . 
Today , he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms . 
He is feeling great . 
He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise .

He is a 7 1 - year - old , right - handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 2 9 , 2 0 8 8 with left arm weakness , ataxia and dysarthria . 
The impression at that time was for lacunar stroke . 
An MRI showed a larger area of infarct in the right corona radiata . 
The patient had worsening weakness on the night of admission , despite being heparinized . 
The following day , he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side . 
Further workup included a magnetic resonance angiogram that showed irregularity of the proximal middle cerebral arteries bilaterally . 
There was no critical carotid stenosis . 
He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction , dilated left atrium , very mild inferior hypokinesis , and no patent foramen ovale . 
He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias . 
His cholesterol level was 1 5 2 with an HDL of 2 3 . 
It was felt that his stroke was most likely due to atherosclerosis of the middle cerebral artery , involving either one or possibly several lenticulostriate arteries . 
He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis . 
He had been on aspirin prior , Plavix was added to his regimen . 
Since his discharge from the hospital , he has been in rehabilitation for the last two months . 
He has had no further episodes of weakness , numbness , tingling , ataxia , dysarthria , or dysphagia . 
He has no symptoms of aphasia . 
He has been left with some dysarthria from his initial event , which he feels has improved . 
I would agree with him . 
He also has regained some strength in the left leg , and is currently working on using a walker with assistance . 
Unfortunately , he has not regained any use of the left arm . 
He has not had any problems with spasms . 
His past medical history is significant for hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus . 
He had an inferior myocardial infarction in 2 0 6 0 . 
He had a quadruple bypass in 2 0 8 3 . 
His last stress test in 2 0 8 7 showed moderate inferolateral ischemia in the region of a prior myocardial infarct . 
He has pulmonary disease due to asbestosis . 
He has chronic renal failure and neuropathy secondary to his diabetes . 
He has also had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy . 
His medications currently include clonidine . 1 mg . p . o . 
He had been on Captopril earlier , but he has since been taken off that medicine . 
He was managed with insulin during his prior admission . 
I assume he is still on this medicine , although he did not specifically state so . 
He has an allergy to sulfa drugs . 
The patient lives with a friend who works at Marble Slab Creamery . 
The patient quit smoking 1 5 years ago and only rarely drinks alcohol on social occasions . 
There is a history of coronary artery disease in his father and at least one of his brothers , but no family history of stroke . 
On examination , he was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress . 
His blood pressure was 1 5 0 / 9 0 . 
His language was intact . 
His speech was somewhat dysarthric , although this was improved from his admission . 
He was alert and oriented . 
His conversation was appropriate . 
The visual fields were full . 
The pupils were equal and reactive at 4 mm . 
Facial sensation was normal . 
There was an upper motor neuron left facial droop . 
The tongue and palate were midline . 
The patient had 0 / 5 flaccid hemiplegia of the left arm . 
There was atrophy of the left biceps . 
There was full range of motion of the joints . 
The patient had 2 / 5 left iliopsoas , 4 + / 5 hip extensors , 3 / 5 left quadriceps , 3 / 5 left ankle dorsiflexors , and 3 / 5 ankle plantar flexors . 
The tone in the lower extremities was not increased . 
His right side was 5 / 5 . 
He had hyperreflexia of the left side and an equivocal toe . 
His right toe was downgoing . 
Sensation was intact to light touch and pinprick . 
I could not find any evidence to pinprick of his neuropathy . 
Vibration sense was very mildly reduced at the toes . 
He was in a wheelchair , and his gait was not assessed . 
Mr . Parrish ' s recovery is progressing . 
He has regained some strength in his left leg and his goal is to be able to walk on his own with either a cane or walker . 
I hope that this will be the case . 
Unfortunately , his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement . 
I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness . 
His stroke was most likely related to atheroma of the middle cerebral artery and lenticulostriate arteries . 
I would encourage his blood pressure to be controlled , as has been done , and to continue an anticholesterol agent . 
I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while . 
The literature suggests benefit for the statin drugs in primary prevention of stroke in patients with elevated cholesterol . 
I do not think that gemfibrozil has been studied in the same way . 
However , since he has been on this medicine so long , it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well . 
He should continue on an aspirin a day . 
He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost . 
I recommended to him that , in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care , patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type . 
We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this . 
This should give adequate time for any ulcerated or unstable plaque in his middle cerebral artery to heal . 
After six months , if he has had no further clinical events , it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin . 
I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months . 
I will arrange for carotid noninvasives and anterior transcranial Dopplers to evaluate his carotid and middle cerebral artery in approximately one year ' s time . 
The patient was seen and examined by Dr . Laith Greene of the Sutton Family Care Stroke Service , who was present for all relevant portions of the history and physical examination .

He said the chest discomfort was moderate , substernal and L chest , nonradiating , relieved by a single dose of NTG . 
He asked his wife to call EMS , by the time they arrived he was CP free but decided to come to the ER given his cardiac history . 
On arrival to the floor he continued to be CP free . 
Of note , 1 d PTA he called his PCP clinic and c / o CP . 
He stated when walking from the H J Heinz Company he had progressive SOB with mild L CP that was similar to , but much milder than this current episode . 
It was relieved by rest and worsened with exertion . 
ER Course : He remained CP free with stable VS . 
The first set of cardiac markers CK 1 7 3 8 , CKMB 2 6 . 3 , Index 1 . 5 , Trop 0 . 0 3 . 
He received ASA . 
The subtle but real changes in the ECG and the non - zero troponin are also concerning . 
Other etiologies include anxiety ( pt described a sense of doom ) , pulmonary causes ( less likely given nl exam and lack of hypoxia ) , musculoskeletal ( pt denies trauma ) , PE ( pt is not tachycardic or hypoxemic ) . 
The most likely etiology is HCV given the strong association of HCV with thrombocytopenia and his longstanding disease . 
Other possibilities include Plavix effect ( although thrombocytopenia predates starting plavix ) , alcohol ( although pt claims abstinence ) , or ITP . 
Hypoproductive etiologies are less likely given nl WBC and Hct . 
He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago . 
He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly .

EMT was called - 2 SL ntg relieved pain , was given ASA . 
On arrival to the ED , he was chest pain free . 
His HR was 5 2 - 6 0 in normal sinus rhythm . 
No known HTN , DM , or hyperlipidemia . 
During exam , patient became acutely diaphoretic , appeared uncomfortable , still complaining of CP with some mild back pain . 
Tele demonstrated sinus brady , then several runs of 4 0 - 5 0 bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia . 
Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB , diaphoretic . 
Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged , 1 2 ld EKG repeated , pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 1 0 0 mg of lidocaine , started on nonbreather . 
Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU .

Pt was taken to the cath lab 7 / 1 1 where his RHC showed RA 9 , PA 2 5 / 1 5 / 2 0 , PCWP 1 3 , CO 6 . 4 . 
Mild LAD disease , 3 0 % circumflex stenosis , RCA 1 0 0 % occlusion , stented x 3 with dissection of RCA during procedure . 
He also had transient reocclusion during procedure . 
TIMI II flow after IC adenosine . 
IABP and temp wire ( for profound bradycardia ) were placed during procedure . 
V - gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK , EF approximately 4 0 % . 
His peak CK were 1 4 9 1 . 
Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event , other causes of low EF were investigated . 
His serum Fe was slightly low , TSH was normal , SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma . 
Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 2 1 0 , Trig 5 9 , HDL 4 5 , LDL 1 5 3 . 
HgbA 1 c was 6 . 3 . 
Because of reocclusion during cath , hypercoag workup was sent and was negative ( including lupus anticoagulant , hypercoag panel , HIT ) . 
He continued to have some chest pain post - cath with mild increase of CK likely d / t distal embolization . 
He has now been persistently pain - free . 
His IABP was d / ced 7 / 1 2 . 
He was continued on ASA , Plavix , Lipitor and Bblocker , Captopril were added and can be titrated up . 
Mother no signific hx . 
Works as professional . 
EtOH : Scarce . 
Pump - EF improved on LV gram at cath . 
Diurese prn , plan echo in 2 - 3 months to assess recovery . 
If persistent low EF , may need further w / u for additional causes of cardiomyopathy . 
He came to the Worthington Regional Hospital Emergency Room at that time . 
By the time he arrived , his symptoms had abated . 
He had an unremarkable electrocardiogram initially and negative cardiac markers , and was admitted to the medicine service to rule - out a myocardial infarction . 
That evening , he had recurrent symptoms and was noted to have sustained wide complex tachycardia , which appears to be ventricular tachycardia . 
He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management . 
The next morning , he underwent cardiac ultrasound , which revealed an ejection fraction of 2 8 % and a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with an akinetic inferior wall . 
Additionally his next set of cardiac markers returned positive . 
He therefore went cardiac catheterization revealing a total occlusion of his right coronary artery and minimal non - obstructive disease of the left system . 
This artery was stented with total of three stents ( two Express stents 2 . 5 x 2 4 mm and one Pixel stent 2 . 5 x 2 8 mm ) , encompassing the entire length of the right coronary artery . 
A left ventriculogram was performed and demonstrated an ejection fraction of 3 0 % with a diffusely hypokinetic ventricle and and akinetic inferior wall . 
He ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 1 4 9 0 and a peak troponin of 2 . 0 . 
A follow - up echocardiogram was performed on July 1 5 , 2 0 9 3 . 
This study showed his ejection fraction had improved to 3 6 % ; the left ventricle was diffusely hypokinetic and the inferior wall appeared severely hypokinetic . 
His reduced ejection fraction was out of proportion to his degree of coronary disease . 
Because of this , a series of laboratory tests were performed which revealed normal iron studies , normal thyroid function , and a normal serum protein electrophoresis pattern . 
He was discharged in stable condition to follow up with me as an outpatient . 
Since his myocardial infarction , Mr . Urban has been feeling quite well . 
He has returned to work in the factory where his employed as a manufacturing manager . 
He has had no symptoms of angina , dyspnea , nausea , or diaphoresis . 
He has felt very well . 
He continues to take his medications without difficulty , and denies any symptomatology whatsoever . 
His past medical history prior to this hospitalization is largely unremarkable because he had not sought medical care . 
Of note , he reports to me that about 8 or 9 years ago while living in Georgia , he presented to an emergency room with some chest discomfort . 
He was evaluated and released . 
He never had any further testing . 
He did not have a stress test , cardiac ultrasound or catheterization . 
Prior to his admission , he did not have any known hypertension or hyperlipidemia , but has been diagnosed with these conditions while in the hospital . 
His medications include aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily , Plavix 7 5 mg daily , Lipitor 2 0 mg daily , lisinopril 1 0 mg daily , and carvedilol 6 . 2 5 mg twice each day . 
He has no known drug allergies . 
Ms . Urban is originally from Nicaragua but after working for Imports , Inc , he moved to Georgia where he lived for 2 4 years working as a Registered Nurse and in various other positions . 
He immigrated to America about a year or so ago . 
He has been working in Borders . 
He currently lives in Toledo , Montana , with his wife . 
He has no children . 
He smoked 1 to 1 - 1 / 2 packs per day for about 3 0 years , but has not smoked since his hospitalization . 
He drinks only socially and denies illicit drug use . 
He has a family history of coronary artery disease in that his father had 3 myocardial infarctions and died at a young age of heart disease . 
On physical exam , his blood pressure was 1 3 0 / 8 2 mmHg in his right arm and 1 2 6 / 8 0 mmHg in his left arm . 
His heart rate is 6 0 and regular . 
In general , he is in no apparent distress . 
His jugular venous pressure is 6 cm of water . 
His chest is clear to auscultation without rales , wheezes , or rhonchi . 
His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S 1 and S 2 . 
He has no murmurs , rubs , or gallops . 
His abdomen is benign . 
His extremities are warm and well perfused and without clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . 
On vascular exam his carotid pulses are 2 + , brisk and without bruits . 
His femoral pulses are 2 + , brisk and without bruits . 
His right femoral artery was entered for cardiac catheterization . 
The site looks clean and intact with no hematoma and no bruit and a strong pulse . 
His distal pulses are 2 + and symmetric throughout . 
His lipid panel from his hospitalization reveals total cholesterol of 2 1 0 mg / dl , LDL of 1 5 3 mg / dl , and HDL of 4 5 mg / dl . 
His electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm . 
He has T wave inversions in III and aVF , and he has a greater than 1 5 degree disparity between his R and T wave axis . 
Mr . Urban underwent a exercise treadmill test with sestamibi imaging yesterday . 
He exercised for 1 0 minutes 4 3 seconds achieving a maximum workload of 1 2 METS , and a peak double product of 2 1 , 6 0 0 . 
His electrocardiogram was negative for ischemia . 
His nuclear images revealed a mild reduction in tracer activity in the inferior wall which persisted after reinjection consistent with his inferior myocardial infarction . 
There was no evidence of ischemia elsewhere . 
His left ventricular ejection fraction was measured at 5 1 % . 
In short , Mr . Urban is a 5 1 - year - old who had an inferior myocardial infarction , but interestingly during his hospitalization had systolic dysfunction well out of proportion to his coronary disease . 
Also , his systolic function has improved over time . 
I think there are two processes going on . 
One is coronary artery disease . 
Clearly this has manifested itself as an inferior myocardial infarction due to an occluded right coronary artery , which was treated during his hospitalization with stenting . 
The other issue is his transient systolic dysfunction that is out of proportion to his coronary artery disease . 
Given the rapid improvement in his ejection fraction , I can only speculate as to the etiology of this . 
He does not appear to have a persistent cardiomyopathy , but a transient one . 
I suspect that this is myocarditis . 
Unfortunatley , I have no way of proving this for certain but clinically it seems to fit . 
It is possible that whatever led to his myocarditis also triggered his acute coronary syndrome . 
From the aspect of his coronary artery disease , he will continue on aspirin for life . 
He received quite a substantial amount of stenting to his right coronary artery , and I would opt to continue his Plavix for at least 1 2 months . 
For his hyperlipidemia , I agree with Lipitor , and we will recheck his lipid profile to see if the dose of Lipitor is adequate . 
His LDL goal will be less than 1 0 0 . 
He is well beta - blocked on his carvedilol , and we will continue with the current dose of 6 . 2 5 mg twice daily . 
His blood pressure allows us to increase his lisinopril from 1 0 to 1 5 mg daily . 
I will see Mr . Urban again in three months for followup . 
I will repeat his echocardiogram in six months ' time to see where his ejection fraction has settled out . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting and pleasant gentleman . 
The patient was seen and examined , and the case was discussed with Dr . Orville Ness . 
Since his last visit in November , he has been feeling well . 
He has had no angina , no exertional dyspnea , no shortness of breath , no orthopnea , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no palpitations , and no other symptoms of note . 
Since his last visit with me , he has participated in and completed outpatient cardiac rehabilitation . 
He found this program to be very helpful ; he sis very well with the program . 
He is currently exercising on a regular basis and has no chest discomfort of dyspnea with exercise . 
He has stopped smoking . 
There have been no difficulties with his medications . 
On 0 3 / 1 6 / 2 0 9 4 , he had a follow - up echocardiogram done ; this study shows an LV ejection fraction of 3 7 % with septal hypokinesis and inferoposterior akinesis ; there is trace mitral regurgitation ; and aortic sclerosis , but no stenosis . 
Notably , he has a right ventricular systolic pressure estimated to be 4 6 mmHg with a right ventricle that is mildly dilated and mildly - to - moderately hypokinetic . 
He has been feeling quite well and has no other symptoms . 
His review of systems is as above and is otherwise negative in detail . 
His blood pressure is 1 1 2 / 6 0 mmHg and his pulse rate is 5 0 beats per minutes and regular . 
His JVP is 7 cm of water with no Kussmaul ' s sign . 
His chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
His heart is regular in rhythm and rate with a normal S 1 and S 2 . 
He has no S 3 or S 4 gallop and no audible murmurs . 
His abdomen is soft . 
It is neither tender nor distended . 
He has normal bowel sounds . 
His extremities are warm and well perfused . 
He has no edema . 
Additionally , he was also found to have cardiomyopathy with an LV ejection fraction of 3 7 percent . 
He is currently asymptomatic from his coronary disease and his LV dysfunction . 
Notably , his last echocardiogram shows that he has increased RV systolic pressure and some early right ventricular dysfunction . 
The etiology of this right ventricular dysfunction is not clear . 
There is likely a component of left heart failure . 
In addition , he may have right heart failure out - of - proportion to left heart failure : he has a longstanding smoking history and may have a degree of COPD and , lastly , he may have obstructive sleep apnea . 
He reports to me that he does snore at night , and his first wife in Georgia had told him for many years that during the night he had periods were he would stop breathing . 
This raises obstructive sleep apnea as a consideration . 
Recommendations : Initially , I am going to start him on Lasix 2 0 mg daily to lower his preload to help with any component of LV failure that is leading to this . 
The rest of his regimen is quite good , and I intend to continue them . 
To help to see if there is any component of cor pulmonale that may be contributing to this , I am going to obtain first a chest x - ray , secondly a pulmonary function testing , and lastly a sleep study . 
If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea , we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly . 
I will see him again in six months ' time . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman . 
He underwent RCA stenting at that time , jailing the RV marginal with sluggish flow afterward . 
Post MI ECHO showed EF of 3 6 % w / diffuse HK . 
He underwent f / u ETT w / imaging in 8 / 9 3 which showed a small fixed inferior defect with considerable residual viable myocardium and no evidence of ischemia . 
EF at that time was 5 1 % . 
He has done reasonably well since then . 
In late spring , Mr Urban noted some chest tightness and SOB similar in quality to his prior angina , but markedly less severe , which occurred with exertion . 
He had a repeat ETT 7 / 3 1 / 9 5 . 
EKG was positive for ischemia . 
Imaging showed a defect that was c / w ischemia . 
His meds were adjsuted , but his symptoms have persisted . 
Today he presented for elective cath + / - via SDA . 
Cath showed his RCA to be totally occluded , with 2 LCX lesions . 
His LCX was stented with 2 cyphers ( 3 . 5 x 1 3 and 3 x 2 3 ) with good results . 
He was put on reopro and transferred to Cardiology where he arrived pain free and in no distress . 
CN II - XII intact . 
JVP flat , no HJR . 
Carotid pulses 2 + , no bruits . 
No HSM / masses / bruits . 
No hematoma / ooze / bruit . 
Pulses 2 + DP / PT , no c / c / e . 
Cardiac : HR , BP well controlled . 
Lipids were somewhat elevated in recent past - lipitor inc to 8 0 mg QD - will repeat in am with LFT ' s and add zetia tonite for better risk modification . 
Increase ASA to 3 2 5 mg QD and add plavix 7 5 mg QD indefinitely . 
He is at high risk of progressive disease given his early RCA ISR . 
Continue reopro as ordered . 
Remove sheaths once PTT normalizes . 
Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted . 
Continue heart healthy diet , exercise , meds as ordered . 
Weigh daily , strict I & O given hx CHF after his MI . 
LP ( a ) was 2 4 last draw - Dr Orozco will consider adding niaspan after evaluating effect of zetia / lipitor in clinic . 
Since his last visit with me he continues to feel well without chest pain , shortness of breath or other symptoms . 
He remains very physically active and has no symptoms with sctivity . 
Normal S 1 and S 2 . 
He has no S 3 or S 4 . 
He has no audible murmurs . 
It is neither tender nor distended . 
No edema . 
He continues to be very active with no symptoms of angina or congestive heart failure . 
Currently , his lipids are under excellent control as is his blood pressure . 
Ongoing secondary prevention and risk factor modification will continue to be paramount in Mr . Urban ' s care . 
I have discussed these issues with him in detail . 
I would like to obtain another echocardiogram to re - assess his ejection fraction which has been low in the past . 
Also , I would like to see if he has had further development of pulmonary hypertension . 
He will continue his current medications and return to see me in six months ' time or sooner if need be .

He left Angels City after I saw him in January when he was free of angina . 
He went back home and rest releived the pain he estimates within 1 5 minutes . 
There days later pain reccurred , again it lasted about 1 5 minutes but this time he went to ED . 
An EKG was " normal " and he was discharged on NG . 
Approximately one week later he experienced another episode of CP similar to the previous ones , he was taken to another hospital and he was hospitalized . 
On July 1 st he was catheterized and found to have " diffuse CAD " involving several vessels . 
Stent placement was not attempted . 
His LV EF was 5 5 % and he was transferred to a medical ward .

Patient instructed to call and come to ED if he experiences CP . 
However he lives in Chardon and driving in can take some time . 
As you know , he is a 7 8 - year - old gentleman with diabetes who was hospitalized at 0 6 / 2 8 / 2 0 9 6 in Quito with any acute coronary syndrome with anterior myocardial infarction . 
I am seeing him on your request to evaluate him for possible coronary artery bypass surgery . 
I have reviewed his records and I have summarized the findings . 
The patient denies having had symptoms of angina until his recent visit to Quiti . 
At that time in June he had several days of very sharp chest tightness and diaphoresis that were prolonged . 
He then presented to the Merlin Clinic in Quuto . 
An LV gram showed an EF of 5 5 % with just mild mitral regurgitation . 
An echo performed here at the Wyandot was consistent . 
Since he has returned to America several weeks ago , he has only had one episode of his chest discomfort , which occurred when he was getting rushed to come to the clinic . 
Since then , he has had no further episodes . 
ROS : Denies PND , orthopnea , symptoms of TIA , stroke , lightheaded , or syncope . 
He does get some pain in his right leg with exertion . 
Meds : aspirin 8 1 mg a day , clopidogrel 7 5 mg a day , bisoprolol 5 mg once a day , ranitidine 3 0 0 mg a day , atorvastatin 4 0 mg a day , metformin 1 0 0 0 mg b . i . d . , and Imdur 2 0 mg in the morning and 1 0 in the evening . 
This is an Equadorian formulation . 
SHx : He does not drink , nor smoke . 
Brother who is diabetic and the other who had cancer of the prostate . 
On exam , he looks well . 
His heart rate is in the 6 4 . 
His blood pressure was 1 1 5 / 7 0 . 
His carotids were 2 + with normal upstrokes and no bruits . 
His jugular venous pressures were not elevated . 
His chest was clear to auscultation . 
His abdomen was soft . 
Extremities were warm and well perfused with good femoral and distal pulses . 
Neurological exam is grossly normal without focal deficit . 
In summary , Mr . Oswaldo is a very nice Spanish speaking 7 8 - year - old gentleman with diabetes and a significant 3 - vessel disease . 
He is likely best suited for CABG and I spent a significant amount of time explaining why stenting his situation would be less satisfactory . 
I will obtain a screening duplex ultrasound of his carotids to assess this risk prior to proceeding . 
He has had a relatively unremarkable recovery with out complication . 
On examination , the lungs are clear , cardiac rate and rhythm are normal . 
Chest radiograph reveals normal findings . 
EKG shows no acute changes and is basically normal . 
His rate is mildly elevated today despite being on a beta blocker . 
Overall , I am quite pleased with progress . 
He has increased activity and should plan to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation in a few weeks . 
Thank you for the privilege of participating in the care of this very nice gentleman . 
I would consider increasing his Toprol dose , but will leave this to your discretion if his rate remains elevated in follow - up . 
We would be happy to see him at any time in the future , if you should so desire . 
His recovery was been uneventful , he has had no further angin and inspite rather severe anemia he has noted marked improvement in exercise tolerance . 
Appetite is better . 
No PND orthopnea or ankle edema . 
There is mild chest soreness on the right side . 
There was aignificant decline in Hct in spite of the fact that he received 2 transfusions in the hospital and he is on iron . 
Mr . Oswaldo has appointmernt with Dr . Jean in the near future .

CVS : s 1 s 2 rrr . 
I offered to send him by ambulance from here , he did not want to go to EW , did not want an ECG stating that he will see his cardiologist next week . 
Patient has a history dietary indiscretion and difficult to control volume overload . 
He called into his cardiologist ' s office Queenie Yeargan on 0 1 / 0 3 / 2 9 , who was being covered by Dr . Haynes to report increasing lower extremity edema and worsening shortness of breath . 
He was prescribed 5 mg of Zaroxolyn daily and had a 1 4 lb weight loss over the next three days . 
The patient developed weakness and continued to feel weak and lose weight despite discontinuing Zaroxolyn on 0 1 / 0 5 / 2 9 under the advise of Dr . Haynes . 
The patient did continue to take the rest of his medications . 
He reported to the ED for lab draw after reporting his symptoms to Dr . Quentin Lemus . 
The patient was given 1 L of NS , 5 0 0 mg levofloxacin , 3 0 U of NPH / 1 0 U of Regular , 1 0 0 mg of Lipitor , and 2 0 0 mg of Zoloft . 
The patient noted a decreased amount of concentrated foul smelling urine , worsening SOB , and dry cough . 
The pt denied lightheadedness , syncope , chest pain , F / C , N / V , abdominal pain , diarrhea . 
SOB : Expected improvement in symptoms with diuresis but patient actually reports worsening of SOB . 
Last ECHO demonstrated normal RSVP but concern now for progressive primary pulmonary process contributing to R heart failure not L sided dysfunction . 
Pt presents very discouraged over escalating Lasix doses and persistant problems with reccurent edema and cough , each time relieved by increasing diuretics , so ACEI cough seems unlikely . 
Avoiding all salt in diet with good compliance . 
Did see sleep lab tech , tried new settings and mask on new machine , but still tolerates poorly . 
When discussed in some detail , notes feelings of suffocation with wearing mask for any period of time . 
Also notes sense of being tied down frrom mask very difficult to tolerate . 
Improving tolerance of CPAP seems very key . 
Pt has started atkins dt with good success ( 6 # in first week ) , and improving BGs are requiring reduction in insulin , which is great . 
We discussed some options . . . Including potential for tracheostomy to fix this without having to address mask , but agreed to try to initiate trial of CBT to see if we can improve mask talerance with symptom reduction . 
He remains quite clear that he has no interest in furhter " exploring " the PTSD history , and I reassured him that CBT does not require doing this . 
Hopefully this would address fluid imbalance to a greater extent as well .

A cardiac echo revealed EF of 6 4 % with no valvular disease and normal wall motion . 
An Aden MIBI 4 / 2 5 revealed inferior and PL ischemia and he was taken to the cath lab . 
The cath revealed mild pulmonary hypertension , PCW of 1 4 , co - dominance with 6 5 % PDA , moderate LCX disease and severe proximal LAD lesion . 
HE subsequently underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD , radial artery to LCX and VG to PDA . 
His PA pressure was 4 5 / 2 0 with a PCW of 2 0 , all grafts were open and his BB and lasix were increased . 
An Aden MIBI 1 2 / 2 7 showed an EF of 6 0 % w small PB scar & inferior - lateral ischemia . 
Echo 2 / 2 8 revealed new LA enlargement with EF of 6 2 % . 
He was admitted 1 / 2 9 with HF exacerbation / acute renal failure in the setting of rapid out - patient diureses with zaroxolyn . 
An echo revealed new mild MR and RF of 5 9 % . 
Over the last few months he has noted episodes of sudden lightheadedness / dizziness , floaters . 
He would take his BP with a home machine and it could be as low as 7 7 / 4 7 . 
In addition , he has noted progressive DOE as well an now rest angina that is requiring a SL TNG for relief . 
He has 3 flights of stairs to climb to his apartment and uses 1 SL TNG prophylactically . 
He was admitted for a cardiac cath 6 / 2 0 , however due to a creatinine of 2 . 4 only a right heart cath was done . 
Given his episodes of sudden hypotension as well as increasing creatinine , Diltiazem as well as Ramipril and Aldactone have been held . 
He reports no further episodes of hypotension since stopping these meds . 
He is being followed by Dr You in renal service . 
Of note , he continues to use the oxygen at night . 
Althought the RA graft to the PDA and VG to LCX are patent - they are small and atretic . 
As you know , he recently had a complicated hospital course . 
He underwent cardiac catheterization , which revealed serial stenoses of the LAD including 7 0 % and 9 0 % stenoses . 
The first marginal branch had a 6 0 % ostial stenosis . 
The right coronary artery had 6 0 and 8 0 % stenoses , respectively . 
The PDA had a 7 0 % narrowing . 
Given his very significant wish not to have bypass surgery , it was decided to proceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well as the obtuse marginal . 
It was felt that the LAD was a small vessel , and not worth going after at this time . 
The RCA was successfully stented , but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior left ventricular branch . 
By the end of the procedure , flow had been restored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch , but Mr . Potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardial infarction . 
Due to the closure of the left posterior ventricular branch , the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated . 
Mr . Potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure . 
The second exercise test was performed with MIBI imaging . 
He exercised for nine minutes on a submaximal Bruce protocol , and experienced chest pain . 
He had a maximal blood pressure of 1 4 8 / 7 2 and a heart rate of 1 2 1 . 
MIBI images revealed a small nontransmural myocardial infarction of the basal 1 / 3 of the inferior wall . 
There was moderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in the territory of the RCA . 
Given these findings , it was highly recommended that Mr . Potts undergo bypass surgery . 
Mr . Potts was discharged on aspirin , Ticlid 2 5 0 mg b . i . d . , Atorvastatin 2 0 mg q . h . s . , Atenolol 5 0 mg b . i . d . , Imdur 6 0 mg q . d . 
He also takes vitamin E and a multivitamin . 
Of note is that Mr . Potts has been under quite a bit of stress recently . 
He is having difficulty arranging the appropriate insurance to cover her medications . 
Mr . Potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge . 
This occurs with increased activity , and is relief with either rest and / or 1 nitroglycerin . 
He has decreased his work level considerably , and is relatively sedentary . 
On physical exam , he was well appearing and in no distress . 
He had a blood pressure of 1 1 2 / 7 0 , with a heart rate of 6 0 . 
His weight was 2 0 3 pounds . 
Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion . 
Cardiac exam revealed a flat JVP of 3 0 degrees , a nondisplaced PMI with a normal S 1 and S 2 , without murmurs , rubs , or gallops . 
Carotids are 2 + bilaterally without bruits . 
His abdomen is soft , nontender . 
There is no organomegaly , and no hepatojugular reflux . 
Extremities are without edema . 
Electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 6 1 . 
Intervals are . 1 6 / . 0 8 / . 4 2 , with an axis of - 1 0 degrees . 
There are flipped T - waves in III and AVF . 
I did not have an old electrocardiogram here for comparison . 
Therefore , Mr . Potts returns today still experiencing angina with mild exertion . 
He has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery . 
He has found out that if he is cleared to go back to work by his physicians , that the Screen Actor ' s Guild will make a good case for this . 
There has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery to return to work as an actor . 
Given Mr . Potts ' s current feeling , I will make an appointment with Dr . Earl Jacob as soon as possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery . 
It is somewhat worrisome that Mr . Potts will be caring for his 8 9 - year - old mother at home , along with his wife . 
His mother currently uses a walker , and I have warned Mr . Potts that he really cannot exert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother in the house . 
He understands this , and if his chest pain should become more frequent , intense , or prolonged , he will immediately call me . 
If Mr . Potts is not scheduled for surgery , I will see him in two weeks at NDNH . 
With best regards .

David Delgado , M . D . 
The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2 0 9 2 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath . 
He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts . 
Surgery otherwise uneventful . 
He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms . 
Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2 0 9 3 at BS which , by his report , showed one occluded graft . 
He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased , intramyocardial LAD , but never really improved . 
Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change . 
He saw Dr . Paulson for 2 nd opinion about 2 months ago . 
His review of angio from Jan : SVG to mid RCA patent , LIMA to 2 nd diagonal patent , SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease . 
LAD intramyocardial . 
LV function normal . 
Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain . 
He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s . l . 
TNG . 
Despite greatly curtailing his activities , he is having daily symptoms . 
He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2 . 8 mins . 
He phoned Dr . Paulson ' s office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation . 
In the ED , he appears comfortable and painfree . 
Did note some left jaw pain earlier . 
HR 7 3 SR , BP 1 2 2 / 7 1 , O 2 sat 9 8 % RA .

Retired . 
Former heavy smoker - quit x 3 0 yrs . 
Rare ETOH . 
Initial cardiac markers negative , ECG unchanged , CXR shows clear lungs . 
In light of progressive symptoms refractory to medical therapy , will proceed with cardiac catheterization , cor / graft angiography , RHC , + / - PCI Tues pm with Dr . Yehuda Quijas . 
He underwent CABG x 3 in 2 0 9 2 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB . 
Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts . 
He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG - at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed . 
Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD , but it was PTCA ' d with no real relief of his symptoms . 
Last year , he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD . 
There was no PCI option available . 
He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved , but the dyspnea has persisted . 
Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic . 
He now presented for cath . 
Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 7 0 % stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch . 
The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis . 
LCX has 4 0 - 5 0 % stenosis proximal to the first OM . 
RCA has 8 0 % stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG . 
The LIMA - & gt ; D 1 is patent and the SVG - & gt ; RCA is patent . 
The SVG - & gt ; LAD is not visualized . 
The mid - LAD lesion was treated with PTCA / stenting with a 2 . 2 5 x 1 2 mm Taxus stent . 
He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress . 
CN II - XII intact . 
Strength 5 / 5 BUE - lower extremities not tested d / t activity limitations . 
JVP flat , no HJR . 
Carotid pulses 1 + , no bruits . 
No HSM / masses / bruits . 
Pulses 1 + DP / PT , no c / c / e . 
Cardiac : HR / BP well controlled . 
Continue current meds . 
Full dose ASA and plavix indefinitely . 
Stop PPI on plavix with new DES . 
Recently increase lipitor to 4 0 mg QD - will check fasting lipids in am along with LFT ' s . 
Adjust dose further as needed . 
Remove sheath once PTT normalizes . 
Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted . 
Continue nitrates for now given intramyocardial vessel and severe native distal LAD disease . 
Endo : Diabetic on glyburide - continue for now . 
Check FS BID - insulin scale as needed . 
GI : on protonix - will change to zantac while on plavix to prevent drug interaction with PPI ' s / plavix . 
Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 9 3 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased , intramyocardial LAD , but never really improved . 
He was admitted to ODC in May 9 4 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid - LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA / Taxus stent . 
He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen . 
He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent . 
The lesion was stented with a 2 . 2 5 x 1 3 mm Cypher stent . 
Retired . 
Former heavy smoker - quit x 3 0 yrs . 
Rare ETOH . 
Regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 and S 2 , with no S 3 or S 4 . 
There were no murmurs , clicks or rubs . 
After his CABG , he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased , intramyocardial LAD in 1 / 9 3 due to recurrent angina . 
He then underwent May 9 4 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid - LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA / Taxus stent . 
He had symptomatic relief until 1 1 / 9 4 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen . 
He then underwent repeat cath in 1 2 / 9 4 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2 . 2 5 x 1 3 mm Cypher stent . 
He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 1 2 / 9 4 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left - sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past . 
The pain was both exertional and non - exertional . 
He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well , though he has mostly been sedentary . 
He denies any orthopnea , PND , leg edema or palpitations . 
He has been compliant with all medications , including ASA and Plavix . 
He is currently chest pain free .

Pt is ready to undergo as recommended ; has concerns re post - op pain control and recommended that she discuss at pre - op visit . 
Since I last saw Ms . Law , she underwent a 3 - vessel coronary artery bypass surgery , internal mammary to the left anterior descending artery , free right radial graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex , and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery . 
She tolerated the surgery quite well and had a short rehab stay . 
Currently , she is doing some walking , but is still feeling quite tired and a bit deconditioned . 
However , her breathing does feel better than prior to the surgery . 
She has some residual sternal wound pain , but it has improved since her discharge .

In summary , the patient is a 6 2 - year - old woman status post CABG , doing well . 
She does appear to be mildly volume overloaded today , therefore I will make the following medication adjustments . 
As far as her cardiac meds , they will change to aspirin 8 1 mg daily , potassium 2 0 mEq daily , Lasix 4 0 mg p . o . 
I will titrate her Lasix on an outpatient basis to have her lose 5 - 7 pounds to improve her shortness of breath as well as her edema . 
We will ask VNA to draw labs as well . 
I will see her again in 2 weeks ' time . 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions . 
Dr . Margaret Aria has requested that she be evaluated prior to surgery . 
Today , reports that she is doing well . 
She graduated from cardiac rehab and is now going to enroll in a supervisored exercise program .

Pt w improved FS today esp w increases to lantus ~ 4 2 - 4 8 units BID . 
She will return to see me in ~ 2 weeks and recheck then . 
She does not need further invasive testing at this time for low risk surgery . 
I will , however , confirm this w her cardiologist to make sure he does have any issues as well with her surgery and add that as an addendum to this note . 
Pt ' s BP is mildly elevated today but typically within goal on her current regimen . 
I will see her back in ~ 2 weeks time , prior to surgery and make sure her BP is well controlled . 
Pt has no hx to suggest bleeding diathesis but will checking her pt / ptt and cbc today . 
Pt will discuss with Dr . Arias regarding when she needs to stop her ASA . 
Diabetes control improving ( see above ) . 
A copy of this letter along w labs and EKG will be sent to Dr . Arias . 
Discussed with pt signs and symptoms that would require prompt medical reevaluation . 
RTC if current symptoms fail to improve or worsen , or if new symptoms appear . 
The patient indicates understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan . 
I personally interviewed and examined the patient . 
My note incorporates my findings , plan and assessment . 
As you know , she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night . 
She has been taking quinine for this , however develops palpitations whenever she takes the quinine . 
She has not been taking this since the initial two doses . 
I suspect that her leg cramps are probably secondary to intermittent passing fluxes . 
I have told her to eat a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg cramps in the evening . 
In the meantime , her EKG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 5 0 per minute . 
There is borderline first degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged from previous tracing . 
We will continue her on Vasotec 1 0 mg bid as well as Lopressor 1 2 . 5 mg bid . 
She will see me in follow - up in three months ' time . 
Again , thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular clinic . 
With warm regards . 
As you know , we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior wall ischemia . 
I wasn ' t sure whether or not this ischemia was new . 
On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes , she did not have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass . 
Therefore , I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not bypass this area . 
She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous venous grafts to the circumflex territory , the OM and the diagonal . 
She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I recommended we continue her current cardiac medications . 
However , she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a history of otitis media in her right ear . 
Therefore , I think it wouldn ' t be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches . 
In the meantime , I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during these episodes . 
I suspect that her blood pressure rise during these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem with her cardiovascular system . 
She will return to see me in follow - up in three months time , at which time I will check her cholesterol level . 
Again , thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient . 
Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions . 
All of the urine tests returned normal . 
Currently she denies any PND , orthopnea or chest discomfort . 
Blood pressure is 1 6 0 / 7 0 in the left arm . 
She has bilateral carotid bruits . 
Abdominal exam is benign . 
EKG shows sinus bradycardia at a rate of 5 0 beats per minute . 
Her previous LDL cholesterol was 1 1 1 . 
The frequency has been less than one time per month . 
She continued to walk and her symptom resolved .

He underwent angiography , but no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention were identified . 
He presents now in anticipation of a distal bypass procedure . 
He has peripheral vascular disease with a prior left femoral - tibial bypass graft . 
He initially presented to the vascular surgery clinic with an ischemic ulceration in the right foot . 
There were no lesions amenable to percutaneous intervention and he underwent right common femoral artery to distal anterior tibial artery in situ saphenous vein bypass graft on 6 / 0 1 / 7 8 . 
He was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on 6 / 0 7 where he reports initially doing well . 
The patient was readmitted in early June because of fevers . 
No source of the fevers were determined but he was started on an empiric regimen of antibiotics . 
During that admission , every other staple in his wound was removed . 
The patient came back to clinic where all of his sutures were removed . 
The surgical site over the lower leg never completely healed and the open area was treated with daily dressing changes . 
He was seen in clinic for follow - up today where his wound was again noted to be open in proximity to the graft . 
Plastic surgery is consulted regarding closure options .

On the right lower extremity , there is an incision from the groin to the foot . 
It is well - healed with the exception of a 5 x 2 cm area over the lower third of the leg just medial to the tibia . 
The graft is palpable just lateral to the area . 
The base of the wound appears to have granulation tissue . 
No odor . 
There is minimal erythema and tenderness around the site . 
Distal pulses palpable . 
Foot warm and well - perfused but with no sensation below the ankle . 
There are other venous stasis ulcers in various stages of healing . 
The great toe has an ulcer with overlying eschar . 
This may be amenable to local flap coverage . 
The patient was discussed with Dr . Uriah Wills . 
James Kopp , M . D . 
Most recently , he had undergone Rle necrotic ulcer debridement ( 0 7 / 7 8 ) , R CFA to distal anterior tibial BPG on 0 5 / 7 8 . 
The wound was overlying the BPG . 
He was made NWB on R , with VAC dressing applied to the wound to be changed twice weekly . 
He has been followed in clinic . 
Though he was noted to have good granulation tissue during his hospitalization one month ago , recently his wound has been concerning for non - healing . 
In clinic , his RLE is ischemic , and there is a concern for wound infection . 
The patient reports that the proximal aspect of his wound had pregressive breakdown over the past 2 - 3 weeks , with associated increase in pain , especially with VAC changes . 
He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery . 
His foot became increasingly discolored , and his toe became necrotic after some minor trauma without response to silvadene .

Mrs . Francesca Sergio - Steven is a 7 2 - year - old Hispanic female who presents with a new - onset acute MI . 
She has no known prior manifestations of coronary disease , but has a long history of insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension . 
She had been in her usual state of health until about 2 weeks ago , when she began to have episodes of chest discomfort . 
She has only had two such episodes until the morning of admission , when she developed severe episode of chest pain at rest associated with shortness of breath . 
She presented to the emergency room here where she was found to have new - onset ST - segment elevation in the inferior leads with a coving morphology involving the lateral leads as well . 
There was also poor R - wave progression V 1 through V 3 . 
She was taken urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where she was found to have a markedly elevated wedge pressure at 3 0 mmHg with a normal cardiac index and blood pressure . 
She had mid inferior wall and lateral wall akinesis initially with 3 + mitral regurgitation . 
There was severe diffuse coronary disease with diffuse LAD disease and total occlusion of the proximal circumflex . 
The right coronary artery was small with a 7 0 % proximal stenosis . 
The occluded circumflex was crossed with a wire and was stented with a Cypher drug - eluting stent . 
She had an excellent result with the wedge also decreasing to 2 0 mmHg . 
She had an estimated 7 0 % ejection fraction despite the inferior and lateral akinesis . 
Cardiac index was 2 . 5 with SVR of 1 7 3 9 . 
She was then brought to the coronary care unit for further evaluation . 
Her past medical history is notable for hypertension for which she takes lisinopril 4 0 mg q . d . 
She also has insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and takes insulin . 
Past medical history is also notable for a hysterectomy . 
Social history is notable for no cigarette or alcohol use . 
She is from Paraguay and has recently arrived in this country . 
Review of systems show no fever , chills , nausea , or vomiting . 
On exam , she is comfortable with a blood pressure initially 1 6 0 / 8 0 with a heart rate of 7 0 and regular . 
Followup pressure 1 2 5 / 8 0 with a heart rate of 7 2 beats per minute . 
Head and neck were unremarkable . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 3 0 degrees . 
PMI is normal . 
S 1 and S 2 were normal with a physiological split . 
There is an S 4 and a 1 / 6 systolic ejection murmur as well as a 1 to 2 / 6 holosystolic murmur and mitral regurgitation at the left lower sternal border . 
There is no S 3 . 
Abdominal exam was unremarkable without organomegaly . 
Bowel sounds are normal . 
Extremities showed no edema or cyanosis . 
Calf site is clean without bruits . 
Distal pulse is decreased but palpable . 
Her resting 1 2 - lead electrocardiogram shows evidence of her evolving inferolateral MI . 
Other lab values included creatinine 1 . 0 with normal electrolytes , hematocrit is 4 4 . 4 % , white blood cell count 3 . 8 with platelets 3 2 2 , 0 0 0 . 
Liver function tests are normal . 
A portable chest x - ray shows pulmonary edema . 
Mrs . Sergio - Steven clearly has evidence of an inferoposterior MI initially with a very high filling pressure and pulmonary edema and mitral regurgitation . 
She has had her circumflex , which is a very large vessel , well treated now with a drug - eluting stent , and her wedge has come down , and her mitral regurgitation is substantially improved . 
At this point , we will bring her to the coronary care unit for careful management with aspirin , Plavix , heparin , continue the Integrilin , as well as Lasix and nitrates . 
We will plan to initiate afterload reduction as soon as tolerated , and also plan beta - blockade to limit her myocardial oxygen demands . 
She certainly has co - existent quite substantial coronary disease including primarily the right coronary artery degree and to some degree the LAD . 
At this point , if she were to have developed recurrent ischemia , we would proceed to consideration of bypass surgery .

She has stable symptoms , nothing to suggest an ACS , but she ' s dyspneic with exertion and takes nitro occasionally . 
Her BP is 1 2 0 / palp in her left arm and her heart rate is 8 0 . 
Her lungs are clear throughout . 
Her apical impulse is non - displaced with a regular rate and rhythm , a normal S 1 and S 2 , but no S 3 or S 4 . 
There is a grade 1 MR murmur noted . 
There is no jugular venous distention and carotid pulses are 2 + bilaterally with soft bilateral bruits . 
Her abdomen is morbidly obese . 
Her extremities are notable for trace lower extremity edema . 
She also has non specific STT wave abnormalities . 
When compared to a previous tracing there is no change . 
For the meantime , I will increase Imdur to 6 0 mg qd , and consider an increase in atenolol . 
Since last seen , she notes a number of somewhat concerning symptoms . 
First of all , she is noting some mid sternal chest discomfort with exertion . 
She associates this with back pain related to a remote back injury , but nonetheless with exertions she develops some degree of mid sternal chest discomfort , non radiating , associated may be with some shortness of breath . 
She has not used any nitroglycerin for it . 
It gets better when she rests . 
She denies palpitations , PND , or orthopnea . 
Her sugars are out of control . 
Her weight is down , nonetheless . 
Well appearing . 
Anicteric . 
Carotids without bruits .

Normal S 1 and split S 2 . 
Soft S 4 gallop . 
In addition , she has nonspecific ST and T - wave changes . 
Compared there is no important change . 
Coronary artery disease status post multiple PCIs . 
Ursula has the return of chest symptoms which are suggestive for angina . 
I will refer her for an exercise tolerance test to better evaluate this . 
I will continue on the current medication program . 
Hypertension . 
Her blood pressure is a bit elevated . 
Given her diabetes , I think it is prudent to add an ACE inhibitor . 
Accordingly , lisinopril 2 . 5 mg QD was added to her program . 
Lipids will be checked . 
I strongly suspect that her LDL is not well suppressed . 
Our goal LDL in this case is less than 7 0 mg / dL . 
It has been nearly 1 8 months since his last visit here and in the interim time , has been having discomfort involving both of his hips , thighs , and calves . 
As you well know , Mr . Mullen is a delightful 6 9 - year - old gentleman with history of hypertension , hyperlipidemia , coronary artery disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and peripheral arterial disease who previously underwent left common femoral and left popliteal artery revascularization November 2 0 8 8 followed by right external , right internal , and right common femoral artery revascularization in February 2 0 8 9 . 
Despite the technical success of both procedures , he continued to have bilateral hip claudication symptoms . 
When we had last evaluated him in November 2 0 8 9 , we had considered moving forward with CT angiography to assess the patency of his aorto - iliac anatomy . 
At the time , he favored moving on a conservative course with improved walking regimen and weight loss . 
Unfortunately , despite these measures , he feels quite disabled and limited by his claudication symptoms . 
Symptoms are noticeable between 2 0 and 5 0 yards distance occurring in the hip area as well as extending down in to his thigh and occasionally the calves . 
Symptoms resolve with sitting and resting for approximately 2 . 5 minutes . 
He notes that symptoms will improve with standing still however sitting symptoms resolve much quicker . 
He does not necessarily notice any change with inclines or going up stairs ; in fact , he is actually able to climb 1 8 stairs to his office without limitation . 
From the cardiac perspective , Mr . Mullen has been free of any symptoms of exertional chest tightness , pressure , or shortness of breath . 
We understand that you are following him in closely in this regard and now requesting up coming chemical stress test given that has been nearly 1 0 years from his coronary artery bypass surgery .

Mr . Mullen ' s symptoms at present are suggestive of vascular claudication and in the sense that they are exertionally related . 
Interestingly , he has had these symptoms dating back to immediately following his revascularization procedures in 2 0 8 8 and 2 0 8 9 . 
On examination today , his femoral pulses are certainly not robust and may suggest the presence of restenosis . 
We discussed with Mr . Mullen the potential of going forward with lower extremity noninvasive studies ; however , these revealed supra - normal ABIs in the past secondary to his diabetes . 
Likewise , we discussed the possibility of moving forward with a non - invasive imaging study i . e . 
CT angiogram ; however , this would not provide the option of therapeutic intervention if indeed narrowings were noted . 
Accordingly , Mr . Mullen is in favor of proceeding forward with diagnostic peripheral angiography plus / minus therapeutic intervention if restenosis of his aortoiliac segments are noted . 
It is indeed possible that there is a contributing factor of spinal stenosis in that Mr . Mullen ' s symptoms are relieved more quickly in the sitting position . 
Likewise , he has noted improvement upon leaning forward and against a tree . 
We understand that Mr . Mullen is being considered for an upcoming chemical stress test to assess the patency for any silent coronary ischemia . 
He is quite reticent to go forward with the chemical stress test though we did broach the subject of performing coronary catheterization at the time of his peripheral angiogram given that we are actually going to be in there . 
He has actually requested this as opposed to going forward with the chemical stress test . 
With your permission , we will perform both coronary catheterization to assess the patency of his grafts in addition to his peripheral angiogram plus / minus therapeutic intervention of his lower extremities . 
Paramount to his ongoing cardiovascular fitness , we certainly recommend blood pressure of 1 3 0 / 8 0 or below and LDL cholesterol 7 0 or below and ongoing exercise and weight loss . 
We will plan to schedule his procedure in the upcoming weeks and he is to notify us if symptoms are progressed in the interim time . 
If you indeed have any questions regarding his visit here today or upcoming procedure , please do not hesitate to contact us . 
I also reviewed and confirmed the PMH , medications , social and family history , and detailed ROS . 
I personally performed a comprehensive cardiovascular examination , including assessment of VS ; auscultation of carotid arteries , lungs , heart , and abdomen ; palpation of carotid arteries , evaluation of jugular venous pressure , palpation of abdominal aorta and lower extremity pulses and perfusion , and neurologic examination for focal deficits . 
I interpreted the EKG and other pertinent laboratory data . 
I discussed findings with the patient and personally developed the management strategy and plans . 
My findings and plans are elaborated on the note above , with which I concur . 
Guy Nunes M . D . 
I permanently follow him for PAD , as I know he follows with Dr . Fernandes for his coronary disease . 
Regarding his peripheral disease , he is status post left common femoral endarterectomy , performed at my request by Dr . Fredrick Xa couple of years ago . 
This alleviated some of his left leg claudication , though he still has some residual symptoms in that left calf . 
The right calf is what bothers him more , with symptoms that are earlier in onset . 
They occurred about 1 0 0 yards of walking on the flat . 
While Chris is affected by this , it does not preclude him from doing his usual activities of daily living . 
He also continues to travel ( on his way to Bogalusa with Brad Fair , his partner , next week ) , and also continues to work actively . 
The biggest problem with his claudication is that it prevents him from being physically active enough to lose enough weight . 
As he says , he put on about 8 0 pounds after his coronary bypass graft in 2 0 8 2 , and he has had trouble losing the weight . 
He is considering weight reduction surgery , but has not made a decision about this yet . 
He is struggling with the decision . 
I would support him either way in this regard , encouraging him to lose weight however he can do so . 
In terms of his lower extremities , his exam demonstrates diminished pulses ( absent to palpation ) in both ankles , but they are audible by Doppler . 
Both feet are well perfused , with good capillary refill . 
He has no ulcers or gangrene . 
From a cardiac standpoint , Chris is doing well . 
He denies significant dyspnea or chest discomfort , although he is limited in terms of walking because of his legs . 
It has been 1 1 years since his bypass operation , and I think it would be reasonable to do a stress test on him to make certain that there is no evidence of silent ischemia . 
While this might be controversial , as to whether to do a stress test or not , my own gut feeling is that it is probably the right time in this patient with significant risk factors and limitations on the basis of his lower extremity disease . 
He requests specifically we do this study here , so I will take the liberty of ordering an adenosine MIBI , and certainly will forward you the results . 
Otherwise , Chris is doing great . 
We will continue to work on risk factor modification and I will see him again in six months . 
We will also order an exercise ABI and duplex of his lower extremities to assess where we stand at the present time . 
If his symptoms progress to the point where they are more disabling , then we would consider further evaluation . 
Otherwise , as long as his symptoms remain stable and his lifestyle is not terribly limited , we will continue the same . 
We will send this along to you as well . 
Thanks again .

I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise . 
Continue her present dose of statin . 
Continue her current regimen . 
As her history is well known to you , I will repeat it briefly for our records . 
Mrs . Olivier is a 6 2 - year - old woman with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease . 
After several catheterizations in the 2 0 6 0 ' s which failed to document significant coronary artery disease ( done for evaluation of chest pain ) , angiogram in July of 2 0 7 1 showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she was managed medically . 
However , she suffered a non - Q wave myocardial infarction on February of 2 0 7 2 at which time she underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary artery disease and therefore underwent a multi - vessel coronary bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA , D 1 and obtuse marginal branch . 
She underwent repeat catheterization in February of 2 0 7 3 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology . 
She underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2 0 7 4 because of a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 6 0 % proximal LAD stenosis , a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch and a 7 0 % stenosis in the mid right coronary artery . 
The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site , a saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch . 
The left intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete stenoses . 
Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 6 0 % . 
She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft to her diagonal artery . 
Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild exertional dyspnea . 
She has undergone extensive pulmonary evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which have revealed an FEV 1 of 1 . 3 which is 5 9 % predicted , and an FVC of 1 . 5 which is also 5 5 % predicted giving her a pattern consistent with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease . 
In addition , she has a history of a seizure disorder , diabetes , hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy . 
Cigarettes - none at present . 
Physical exam reveals a well - nourished mildly overweight woman in no acute distress . 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 1 4 0 / 7 0 , heart rate 7 5 and regular , respirations 1 2 and unlabored , weight 1 7 2 pounds . 
The neck is supple . 
JVP flat . 
Carotids are 2 + without significant bruits . 
Chest is clear with a trace right basilar rhonchi . 
Cardiac exam shows a normal S 1 , physiologically split S 2 and a I - II / VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base , no significant diastolic murmur or rub . 
The abdomen is benign with bowel sounds well heard . 
Extremities without appreciable edema . 
Peripheral pulses are intact . 
There is 1 + bipedal edema . 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 7 5 . 
PR interval of . 1 4 , QRS . 0 8 , QT . 3 4 , axis - 2 0 degrees . 
There is evidence of a left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V 1 through V 3 . 
She denies any active chest discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at alleviating the chest pain syndrome . 
The records available to me indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an exacerbation of her angina . 
However , now that she is status post her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker reduction and therefore , I suggested she decrease her atenolol to 5 0 mg po q . d . 
Otherwise , I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur . 
I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem appropriate . 
Currently , she complains of mild exertional fatigue and rare exertional chest discomfort . 
In addition , she states that she has no energy and worries that her coronary artery pathology has returned . 
She reports occasionally taking sublingual nitroglycerin for chest discomfort but this is on an infrequent basis . 
Physical exam reveals a well - nourished woman in no acute distress . 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 1 4 0 / 8 0 , heart rate 8 5 and regular , respirations 1 2 and unlabored , weight 1 7 4 pounds . 
The neck is supple . 
JVP flat . 
Carotids are 2 + without significant bruits . 
Chest is completely clear . 
Cardiac exam shows a normal S 1 , physiologically split S 2 and a I - II / VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base , no significant diastolic murmur or rub . 
The abdomen is benign . 
Extremities without appreciable edema . 
Peripheral pulses are intact . 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 8 5 . 
PR interval of . 1 4 , QRS . 0 8 , QT . 3 2 , axis - 2 0 degrees . 
There are mild diffuse nonspecific ST - T wave changes as well as evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy . 
Compared to her last electrocardiogram , her heart rate is slower and her ST - T wave changes are less prominent . 
Currently it is not clear to me that her symptoms are secondary to recurrent ischemia , however I will have her undergo an exercise tolerance test ( adenosine MIBI ) to help to further evaluate this . 
In addition , I will obtain routine blood studies including an glycosylated hemoglobin . 
It is certainly possible that her fatigue and generalized sense of lack of energy is from a non - cardiac cause . 
Pending review of these lab studies however , I have not altered her present regimen . 
She will contact you or myself should her chest pain syndrome at all progress in terms of severity or duration . 
Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care . 
Since last seen , she reports return in a non - exertional left shoulder discomfort syndrome , occasionally associated with mild dyspnea . 
Of note , she underwent a dobutamine MIBI stress test last June for evaluating a similar syndrome , and at that time she developed her typical chest and left back pain syndrome in association with no diagnostic EKG changes at a peak heart rate of 1 2 7 , peak blood pressure of 1 6 0 / 6 0 . 
A simultaneously obtained SESTA MIBI scan revealed a global left ventricular fraction of 4 2 % , a non - Q - wave myocardial infarction involving 2 out of 2 0 segments of the inferior wall and minimal peri - infarct ischemia . 
In addition , a venous duplex ultrasound study done to evaluate her severe left greater than right peripheral edema showed no evidence of DVT . 
Currently she remains on a regimen of amlodipine 5 mg poqd , atenolol 5 0 mg poqd , simvastatin 1 0 mg poqd , lisinopril 1 0 mg poqd , Nitropatch . 4 mg q . 1 2 hours , Neurontin 4 0 0 mg potid , furosemide 4 0 mg poqd ( recently increased ) , Lamactil 1 5 0 mg pobid , Trusopt and Xalantan drops , insulin 1 0 units of CZI with 7 2 units NPH qam and 7 4 units NPH qpm . 
Physical exam reveals an overweight woman in no distress . 
Blood pressure , right arm sitting - 1 1 0 / 7 0 , heart rate - 7 0 and regular , respirations - 1 2 and unlabored , weight - 1 7 4 pounds which is four pounds below her weight of six months ago . 
The neck is supple with JVP flat . 
Carotids are 2 + without significant bruits . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac exam shows normal S 1 , physiologically split S 2 , and a I / VI holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla . 
No significant diastolic murmur or rub . 
The abdomen is benign . 
Extremities reveal marked left greater than right pedal edema . 
Peripheral pulses are diminished . 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 7 0 , PR interval of . 1 2 , QRS of . 0 6 , QT of . 3 6 , axis of - 2 5 . 
There is borderline Paul Arteaga , M . D . 
Compared with the last electrocardiogram , there has been no significant change . 
Presently , Mrs . Olivier has evidence of continuing chest and left shoulder discomfort which she believes is similar to her pre - bypass surgery angina . 
In this setting , a dobutamine stress test performed last June showed no evidence of provokable ischemia . 
I have spent some time discussing with Ms . Olivier our various therapeutic and diagnostic options . 
She made it quite clear that she would not consider repeat cardiac catheterization at this time , and furthermore , was very disinterested in pursuing the possibility ( should she require it ) of either mechanical or surgical re - vascularization . 
It is not entirely clear to me that her left shoulder syndrome is in fact ischemic in origin , and she certainly understands it may be secondary to musculoskeletal abnormalities . 
I have suggested that she discuss that further with you . 
In the meantime , I have asked her ( as her back and chest discomfort syndrome appears to occur mostly at night prior to lying down for bed ) to apply her Nitropatch in the evening and take it off in the morning . 
She will call me within the next several days to report how this helps her discomfort syndrome . 
I do not believe that she is having GERD to explain her symptoms . 
In light of her reluctance to undergo any further diagnostic cardiac studies , I will try to tailor her anti - ischemic medications to minimize her chest discomfort syndrome . 
I , of course , will keep you fully informed as to her progress , and I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care .

Oscar Nall , M . D . 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension . 
He also had an episode of bronchitis about 2 months ago , which was treated with antibiotics . 
Blood pressure is 1 4 2 / 9 0 and pulse is 6 4 . 
Chest is clear bilaterally . 
Positive S 1 and S 2 . 
Negative S 3 and S 4 . 
No murmur . 
Abdomen is soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds . 
Lower extremities , no edema , nontender . 
Diabetes mellitus . 
The patient reports blood sugars which have ranged from 1 0 6 - 1 5 8 and reports overall good control of his diabetes mellitus . 
We will continue current treatment , especially in view of the fact that his most recent hemoglobin A 1 c in February was 6 . 1 and repeat hemoglobin A 1 c when he returns for his next visit . 
Hypertension . 
The patient ' s atenolol was recently decreased from 5 0 mg to 2 5 mg because of bradycardia and lisinopril was increased to 6 0 mg because of microalbuminuria . 
The patient ' s heart rate is appropriate at 6 4 even though his blood pressure remains borderline elevated . 
We will check a microalbumin today . 
Recent TSH was mildly suppressed and we will repeat this today . 
Regular healthcare maintenance . 
A CT of the patient ' s chest will be repeated when he returns for his next visit as recommended by radiology . 
He was admitted on 0 7 / 2 3 / 2 0 8 2 , one month after previous admission for abdominal pain . 
In retrospect , that admission may have been related in part to GI symptoms of heart failure . 
He came in complaining of continued GI discomfort , orthopnea , lower extremity edema , and 9 pounds of weight gain with increasing abdominal girth . 
His medications at the time of admission included beta - blockers and ACE inhibitors for hypertension , with no diuretics . 
During his hospitalization , he underwent 7 . 5 kilograms of diuresis with resolution of his jugular venous pressure from approximately 2 5 cm to 8 cm . 
His echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 2 0 % with LV dimension of 5 . 1 , enlarged right ventricle with mild decrease in RV function , but severe RV pressure overload with estimated PA pressure 8 0 plus the right atrial pressure . 
After he had his diuresis , he underwent right heart catheterization , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 1 8 , PA pressure of 6 5 / 3 5 . 
He underwent a trial with IV nitroglycerin , then with sildenafil . 
The IV nitroglycerin decreased his BLANK pressures only by approximately 8 - 1 0 mm but he noted a further improvement in his dyspnea . 
There was no clear improvement with the sildenafil in either his symptoms or hemodynamics . 
His cardiac output varied between 3 . 1 and 4 . 5 on all the medications . 
The decision was just to put him on oral nitroglycerin in addition to the other standard heart failure medications . 
He also underwent a MIBI looking for any evidence of active ischemia , which there was none . 
At the time of discharge , he is walking easily without postural change or symptoms . 
His medications are Isordil 1 0 t . i . d . , Lasix 4 0 mg p . o . 
He is on Toprol - XL 1 2 . 5 daily . 
His lisinopril was decreased from 4 0 mg to 2 0 mg , but should he have any problems with hypotension , this could certainly be decreased further to 1 0 or even 5 mg if necessary to allow him comfortable ambulation . 
He is on Plavix 7 5 mg daily as well and simvastatin 4 0 . 
His discharge blood pressure is 1 0 2 / 6 0 , jugular venous pressure is 8 - 9 cm . 
His creatinine is 1 . 3 with a BUN of 4 4 , hematocrit 4 0 , white blood count 5 0 0 0 , potassium 3 . 9 , sodium 1 3 9 . 
It has been my great pleasure to participate in his care . 
He is trying very hard to learn how to manage his disease at home , with the help of his family . 
He has an appointment to see Dr . Anderson on 0 8 / 2 0 / 2 0 8 1 , and is looking forward to returning to your care . 
I would be happy to answer any further questions about it .

Frederick Q . Valladares , M . D . 
Surgery is scheduled on January 2 8 , 2 0 8 9 by Dr . Xavier Israel kenneth Xenos . 
Over the past year patient has had difficulty with right upper quadrant pain as well as epigastric pain . 
These episodes tend to happen more frequently after she has had a rich meal . 
Other symptoms that occurred include nausea and vomiting . 
Patient denies jaundice . 
Today , patient states that she still has some abdominal tenderness greatest at the right costal margin and radiating into right flank . 
At the time of evaluation on 1 2 / 3 0 / 8 8 patients had symptoms of URI and LRI . 
She reported back / green sputum , mild shortness of breath and increased use of her grandson ' s inhaler . 
After consultation with Dr . Valladares it was decided that patient should be evaluated by her primary care provider for further treatment of her respiratory tract infection and then follow - up with surgeon to reschedule her surgery . 
Patient reports that she went to University Hospital and there they treated her with antibiotics and inhaler . 
Unfortunately patient is unable to recall the name of the antibiotic or the inhaler . 
Currently she denies any symptoms of sputum production , cough , shortness of breath , or wheezing . 
Also denies fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea . 
Patient does have a history of coronary artery disease . 
She is status post an MI 1 1 / 8 2 . 
Patient had cardiac catheterization at OSH 1 2 / 3 / 8 2 that reportedly showed a critical mid right lesion and a mild left main and left anterior descending lesion . 
Patient did well until 1 0 / 8 3 when she was admitted to PVH with symptoms of chest tenderness , left arm pain , tachycardia , palpitations , diaphoresis , dry mouth , shortness of breath , dizziness , and darkening of revision . 
Patient did rule out for MI by serial enzymes and there are no changes seen on her ECG . 
Patient denies any difficulty with chest pain or left arm pain since that time . 
She has had episodes of shortness of breath with exertion however , these seem more related to her respiratory status rather than her cardiac disease . 
Stress test done 1 / 2 6 showed a normal exercise capacity ( METS = 7 ) , ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia and the perfusion images were suggestive of anterior ischemia although body habitus limited the interpretation . 
Suffered a cerebral thrombus with infarction . 
Symptoms at the time of admission were severe headache , facial numbness , and facial droop as well as mutism . 
Patients underwent plasma phosphor uses and became acutely hypoxic and hypotensive requiring emergent intubation . 
Was felt that patient ' s symptoms or secondary to a transfusion reaction . 
No residual symptoms . 
Patient originally scheduled for surgery on 1 2 / 3 1 / 8 8 however because of LRI surgery was postponed . 
Patient much improved , lungs clear , no wheezing , no shortness of breath . 
It has only been three - week since her infection and therefore increased airway reactivity may be an issue . 
Dr . Hoffman explained this to patient . 
Dr . Hoffman also reviewed with patient medications to take prior to surgery 1 / 2 8 / 8 9 . 
Currently , patient denies any symptoms of cardiac ischemia . 
Does have chronic chest pain / tenderness which is reproducible by palpation . 
Patient states that this is not her " cardiac pain " . 
HPI : Pt initially presented to her PCP on day of admission with a complaint of 2 weeks of intermittent chest pain . 
Pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 2 0 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the L sternal border with radiation to L lateral thorax and radiation to L arm , accompanied by tingling / numbness in L digits + occasionally right digits , as well as down the L leg . 
She reports that the pain , at it ' s worst is 5 / 1 0 , but has improved to 2 / 1 0 after NTG en route to the ED and once in the ED . 
She affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain . 
Pain has no relationship to position or activity - - has occurred during sitting , ambulation , and reclining . 
Pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain , L > R , follow by chest pain . 
Pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping , and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath , which varies between one to two times per week .

I don ' t feel a mass or adenopathy , but worth further evaluation with CT , barium swallow if sx persist . 
BP needs better control , goal 1 3 0 / 8 0 , addition diuretic and increase in ACE - I appropriate . 
The pain lasted approximately 1 5 - 2 0 minutes . 
EMS was called , who brought him to the HCC ED , where he was found to be tachypneic , with an O 2 of 8 5 % . 
His pain was alleviated with IV NTG , and BiPap improved his O 2 saturation . 
He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin . 
He was begun on aspirin , lopressor , lasix , heparin , and integrelin and sent to the cath lab , where he was found to have 3 - vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions . 
He was sent to the SDU , where he was started on lasix 6 0 IV BID and a CABG pre - op workup was begun . 
Since admission to the SDU , he has been stable , with excellent RA sats . 
His Troponin - T peaked at 2 . 9 1 and was slow to return to normal , 2 . 6 5 on last draw today . 
He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement , having no chest pain . 
On the floor , he was stable but had a 1 5 - beat self - limited run of MMVT , his BP was 1 1 0 / 6 0 and he was asymptomatic , with no chest pain or dyspnea . 
He was given 4 gm iv of MgSO 4 , 6 0 mEq of KCL . 
Repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin - T of 3 . 7 3 but with a CK of 1 3 3 ( 3 0 3 ) and CK - MB of 5 . 2 ( 1 6 . 2 ) .

Thanks for letting us participate in the care of this pleasant gentleman and let me know if I can be of further assistance . 
He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2 0 6 4 . 
At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w / an NSTEMI . 
Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA . 
He underwent CABG on 0 3 / 3 1 / 2 0 6 4 , off - pump , w / a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM . 
His post - operative course was uncomplicated . 
He presented to DSH on 8 / 1 4 w / SOB , found to be in CHF ( BNP 4 8 2 ) . 
He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w / an initial TnI of 0 . 6 rising to 2 3 . 8 o / n . 
His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 7 4 5 and CK - MB of 8 0 . 3 with a fraction of 1 0 . 7 % . 
He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch - down and complete occlusion of his SVG . 
A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management . 
He has 2 sisters , and 1 brother .

Duplex ultrasonography after compression showed no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm . 
Narrowing of the artery . 
Apparent filling defect , most likely artifactual . 
On physical examination , he has mild non expansile hematoma of the right chest wall . 
His right hand is warm and well perfused , with 1 + radial and brachial pulses . 
There are no thrills or bruits . 
Diffuse arterial calcifications - obscures the ability to read what is or is not in the lumen . 
Venous contrast bolus delivered on the right side - obscures our ability to discern the anatomy in the area of the subclavian artery . 
Contrast bolus inadequate to comment on arterial anatomy . 
Based on his clinical exam , and the fact that he is on an anticoagulant , a follow up subclavian artery ultrasound examination is in order . 
This test should be geared towards determining whether there is any evidence of a pseudoaneurysm . 
If there is an intraarterial filling defect , I would not pursue it . 
He is anticoagulated and his arm is viable . 
There are no stigmata of atheroemboli . 
I will review his history for you . 
Mr . Nielson is a 7 6 - year - old gentleman who states that approximately three months ago , he had some increased swelling of his left leg . 
About three to four weeks ago , this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon , Indiana . 
At that point , a CT scan was performed . 
CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2 . 0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1 . 5 cm node just posterior to that , also a 1 . 0 cm retrocrural node was seen . 
CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3 . 0 to 3 . 5 cm in diameter on the left side . 
The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6 . 0 cm in diameter . 
The patient was then seen by Dr . Lopez on April 1 2 th who noted firm edema in the left leg and referred him to me for evaluation . 
The patient says at that point he came to the Hilton Head Medical Center with severe photophobia and was diagnosed with scleritis . 
This recurred in 2 0 9 3 . 
He has been treated intermittently with low - dose azathioprine and steroids . 
He is currently on a minimal dose of steroids .

Denies trouble chewing or swallowing but does gag when he drinks water intermittently . 
Denies wheezing . 
Does report an intermittent dry cough secondary to nasal drip for the last two weeks . 
Reports a runny nose for the last two weeks . 
Increase in shortness of breath over the last month . 
No muscle pain or muscle aches . 
Denies chest pain . 
Does report a sensation of burning pressure over his chest lasting approximately 4 to 5 minutes at a time , with exertion , this happens at least once a week , sometimes twice a week , it resolves quickly when he rests . 
Denies palpitations . 
Does report that he has been bruising more easily over the last several months . 
No abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting . 
Intermittent constipation . 
No diarrhea . 
No weakness , numbness or changes in his mood or affect . 
His wife is wheelchair bound and he is her sole caregiver . 
He has four sons and two daughters . 
He has grandchildren , four boys and four girls . 
The patient was the long time Chief of Security for Cisco . 
This job is currently held by his son . 
He smoked about a pack a day from age 1 4 to age 5 0 quitting about 2 6 years ago . 
Did drink significantly in the past , but usually only on the weekends , but did not drink everyday . 
The patient s mother had breast cancer , which was cured and died at age 8 9 of old age . 
The patient s brother had some sort of new cancer in his armpit ; the exact histology is unknown . 
Head is normocephalic and atraumatic , thinning head of grey hair . 
Pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation . 
Extraocular muscles are intact . 
Oropharynx is moist . 
No mucositis , pharyngitis , thrush or increased lymphoid tissue is seen . 
The patient has a scar in the inside of his left buccal mucosa . 
He has numerous actinic keratoses over his scalp and behind his left ear . 
Otherwise , skin reveals no jaundice , rash or suspicious lesions . 
Tongue is midline and well papillated . 
The patient has a hearing aid in his right ear . 
Neck is supple and somewhat full . 
No jugular venous distention or thyromegaly is visible . 
No wheezes , rales or rhonchi . 
There is a very old healed scar in the left posterior flank consistent with prior nephrectomy . 
Abdomen is obese , soft , nontender and nondistended . 
Positive bowel sounds . 
No hepatosplenomegaly is palpable . 
The patient has a 1 . 0 cm lymph node deep in the right axilla . 
No epitrochlear lymphadenopathy . 
Strength 5 - / 5 , bilateral grip , bicep , triceps , deltoids , knee flexion and extension . 
Sensory exam intact to light touch bilateral upper extremities and decreased sensation to light touch in the left lower extremity . 
Liver function tests are within normal limits . 
Hemoglobin A 1 c is 6 . 
White count of 5 . 2 , hematocrit of 3 3 . 9 with an MCV of 8 1 and a platelet count of 1 5 5 , 0 0 0 . 
To my initial evaluation , there is notable PET avid lymphadenopathy both in the retroperitoneal space as well as in the left inguinal region . 
Mr . Danny Nielson is a 7 6 - year - old gentleman with notable lymphadenopathy both by report from the outside hospital as well as by my initial evaluation of his CT scan from Mount Ascutney Hospital . 
This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma . 
I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son . 
I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable . 
This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy . 
These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region . 
I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies , chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found . 
The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low - grade lymphoma . 
However , the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher - grade process . 
I feel that his left - sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg . 
However , further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology . 
I introduced the patient to Dr . Victor Ashley who is scheduled to perform a core needle lymph node biopsy later this afternoon . 
If he will be diagnosed with an aggressive lymphoma and will need anthracycline , it would be important to have Cardiology on board . 
He has a significant murmur and his symptoma are suggestive of angina . 
The patient will be evaluated by Dr . Square Turk later this week . 
In follow - up , Mr . Nielson will see me back in clinic next Sunday six days from now . 
At that point , we should have a firm and final biopsy report in hand and the staging studies also have been completed . 
At that point , we will be able to discuss therapy in a meaningful way . 
The patient will call me back if problems arise in the meantime . 
He also developed b / l groin swelling greater on the left ; the swelling in the left groin was tender . 
He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6 . 0 cm inguinal node , a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space , adenopathy in the external iliac chain ( largest 3 . 5 cm ) , and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta . 
He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping . 
Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B - cell populations and an inverted CD 4 / CD 8 T Cell ratio , with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation . 
The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May , and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness . 
PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass , improvement in lymphadenopathy , and a small pancreatic cystic lesion . 
It was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease . 
The patient subsequently had his next two CHOP treatments in mid June and early July . 
PET scan and lymph node biopsy in early July revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation . 
The patient was seen in clinic by Dr . Quadri twice in July , with the second visit revealing increased PET avidity and persistence of the primary mass . 
Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP , the patient was evaluated by Dr . Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7 / 2 8 for consideration of auto - SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen . 
Due to the patient ' s age and consideration of risk / benefit , it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first . 
Mr . Nielson was admitted on 8 / 2 / 2 0 9 7 to receive his first cycle of R - ICE with dose - reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h / o nephrectomy . 
He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia . 
He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days . 
On 8 / 9 , he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8 / 1 6 , he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia . 
He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R - ICE on 8 / 2 2 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia . 
He says that he currently feels cold - intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May . 
He denies any recent N / V , diarrhea , constipation , lightheadedness , orthostatic dizziness , hematuria , BRBPR , or melena . 
Side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness , cold - intolerance , and constipation . 
Cites family as major source of support with daughter taking care of organizing his medications . 
He was formerly a security officer for a technology company and denies any exposures . 
He has a 4 0 pk year smoking history ; non - smoking for 2 5 years . 
He has a heavy ETOH history in the past that he reduced to a beer or martini every day in the past few years . 
The patient is resistant to giving further details . 
He has not had anything to drink since he started his chemotherapy regiment . 
He denies history of illicit drugs , IV abuse , or h / o STDs and is not currently sexually active . 
FH : - Father : Colon carcinoma , Mother : Breast cancer , Brother : unknown cancer . 
No family history of HTN , DM , CAD . 
ROS : Please see pertinent positives and negatives in HPI . 
Otherwise negative in detail . 
Radial pulses 2 + b / l . 
No splenomegaly or hepatomegaly appreciated . 
Likely right greater trochanteric bursitis . 
Status post left nephrectomy and cholecystectomy . 
For further results please consult CAS . 
No evidence of aortic insufficiency . 
PMH is significant for aortic stenosis ( EF 7 4 % , valve area : 1 . 3 ) , steroid induced DMII , and Wegener ' s . 
In brief , this is a 7 7 yo man w / Stage IIIB diffuse large B - cell lymphoma s / p 4 cycles of CHOP and 1 cycle of R - ICE her now for his cycle 2 of R - ICE . 
We will maintain hydration and monitor renal function as this pt has only one kidney . 
His type two diabetes will be controlled with his home regimen and his maintenance steroids that he takes for Wegener ' s will be held as they are replaced by dexamethasone via R - ICE . 
We will transfuse to maintain platelets over 2 0 K and HCT over 2 5 as needed . 
His exam is non - concerning . 
He underwent salvage with two cycles of R - ICE and unfortunately continued to have PET avidity in the area . 
As a result , we scheduled him to begin therapy with Zevalin next Monday . 
He is here for a follow up physical and count check to make sure he has adequate platelets for this immunotherapy . 
He sat down for approximately 1 0 minutes , it resolved , and has not recurred since then . 
However , we also have the reports of a follow up PET / CT scan which was performed yesterday which show a new accumulation of bilateral pleural effusions which the radiologist feels are most consistent with heart failure . 
In addition , the scans also showe the prior area of PET avidity in the leg continues , although less avid . 
This area is in the medial compartment of the left thigh within the adductor muscles . 
Mr . Nielson is not excited about this . 
Pain index is 0 / 1 0 . 
Fatigue index is 5 / 1 0 . 
Heart rate is tachycardic with an ejection murmur and occasional missed beats . 
Lungs do have reduced breath sounds bilaterally . 
Chemistries examination reveals sodium of 1 4 1 , potassium of 3 , chloride of 1 0 4 , carbon dioxide of 2 8 . 3 , calcium of 9 . 1 , BUN of 2 4 , creatinine of 1 . 6 , total protein 6 . 3 , albumin of 3 . 7 , total bilirubin of 0 . 8 , alkaline phosphatase of 5 8 , SGPT of 2 1 , SGOT of 2 2 , and LDH of 2 0 8 . 
I suspect he will be admitted . 
Hopefully , they will be able to get his cardiac issues under control . 
Unfortunately , from an oncologic point of view , it is uncertain whether his platelet count will reach at least 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 in order to give this man therapy . 
As a potential other therapy , we will discuss the ability of radiation oncology to increase the number of cGy to that local area considering he only received 3 0 at the onset . 
Now s / p 4 0 gray XRT to limited recurrence site in left groin . 
He was hospitalized recently for neutropenia and fevers , received cefepime and vancomycin , and was discharged on 2 / 2 / 2 0 9 8 . 
As per d / c summary , he received cefepime for E . coli and VRE UTI ( though this is a little confusing since urine culture negative that admission , and positive for these organisms in 1 1 / 2 0 9 7 ) . 
During most recent admission he was found to be C . diff positive , but appears to have had incomplete course of Flagyl . 
He has had crampy abdominal pain , diarrhea , and experienced some lightheadedness this morning . 
Denies HA . 
Denies CP , respiratory sx , urinary difficulty , N / V . 
CT scan of the pelvis revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3 . 0 to 3 . 5 cm in diameter on the left side . 
The largest node in the inguinal area measured approximately 6 . 0 cm . 
Enlargement in size may represent necrosis from treatment effect . 
Improvement in left iliac adenopathy and resolution of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy . 
Small pancreatic body cystic lesion - may be IPMT .

The patient reports having a longstanding history of greater than four months of worsening pain , paresthesias , and " numbness " on the right worse than left hand . 
This is worse at night and does occasionally wake him up from sleep . 
Also bothers him during prolonged activity . 
He also reports recently over the past few months noting difficulty with the key pinch , grasp , and fine motor function . 
Previous evaluation consisted of cervical spine MRI as well as EMG nerve conduction studies demonstrating findings significant for severe compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of wrist . 
He now comes for evaluation for potential carpal tunnel surgery release . 
Examination of the right hand demonstrates marked thenar atrophy . 
He has a positive Tinel ' s , positive Phalen ' s , and positive median nerve compression test at the wrist . 
His interossei and extensors are full . 
Sensation is intact throughout . 
EMG studies from 1 1 / 0 9 / 2 0 7 1 , performed here at Folsom Convalescent Hospital , significant for right worse than left median nerve compression neuropathy at the wrists . 
At this time , we feel that Larry has indeed a significant , right worse than left , bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome . 
We discussed with Larry the risks and benefits of this procedure and he is in agreement of the plan . 
We will try to schedule him to proceed with surgery at some point in the near future . 
We filled out both history and physical , as well as a surgical consent form today in the office . 
He has maintained his weight , which has been quite difficult given the social commitments that he has . 
He is requiring to eat out quite a bit . 
He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months . 
This caused him to be more exhausted than usual . 
His incarcerated hernia repair has stood up . 
He has some discomfort occasionally in that area , but for the most part feels that this is back to normal . 
He is careful with his diet as much as he can be . 
He had a cold over the last month or so . 
It slowly resolved . 
He is asymptomatic presently .

On the other hand , he is a little worked up over his wife ' s injury , and we will monitor his pressure . 
For now , we will sit tight . 
Plan : Monitor blood pressure . 
Low threshold for starting an ACE inhibitor .

Her current medications are aspirin 3 2 5 mg PO q . day , Lasix 4 0 mg PO q . day , Glipizide 1 0 mg PO q . day , Losartan 1 0 0 mg PO q . day , Toprol XL 1 0 0 mg PO q . day , Simvastatin 1 0 mg PO q . day , Avandia , and multivitamins . 
On physical examination , her blood pressure today is 1 3 0 / 6 0 . 
Her heart rate is in the high 6 0 s . 
She is comfortable seated on the examination table . 
Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8 . 
Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases . 
Cardiac examination reveals a non - displaced PMI with normal intensity S 1 and S 2 . 
She has a grade II / VI holosystolic murmur at the apex and a grade II crescendo / decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border . 
She has 1 - 2 + edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch . 
Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 6 8 beats per minute , normal axis and intervals . 
There are nonspecific ST abnormalities . 
Overall , Ms . Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure . 
She has signs of very mild volume overload on examination , with preserved perfusion . 
We elected to maintain her present dosing , but discussed increasing her dose to 4 0 mg PO q . a . m . and 2 0 mg PO q . p . m . should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise . 
It was a pleasure being involved in her care . 
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions . 
Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 1 2 months ago , she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms . 
She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion , but no longer experiences significant dyspnea . 
She denies orthopnea , PND , or ankle edema . 
Her current medications are aspirin 3 2 5 mg p . o . 
Her blood pressure today is 1 6 5 / 7 0 and her heart rate is in the low 6 0 s . 
She is comfortable seated on the exam table . 
Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves . 
There are very rare crackles at the bases . 
Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm , normal intensity S 1 and S 2 . 
P 2 is increased . 
There is a grade 3 / 6 holosystolic murmur , loudest at the apex . 
She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch . 
Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals . 
There is nonspecific ST abnormality , unchanged from her tracing in August . 
In summary , Ms . Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms . 
She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease . 
In light of her systolic hypertension , we increased her Toprol to 1 5 0 mg p . o . 
She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me . 
I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months . 
It remains a pleasure being involved in this delightful woman ' s care . 
She was initially seen on 1 1 / 0 1 / 8 1 after a mechanical fall which resulted in comminuted bimalleolar ankle fracture for which she underwent ORIF on 1 1 / 0 4 / 8 1 . 
She had follow - up with her orthopaedist on 1 / 1 5 / 8 1 at which time she was noted to have an eschar with poor wound healing around the medial malleolus . 
She was therefore admitted yesterday for I & D of the open lesion on her ankle , as well as hardware removal . 
There is no operative report from the procedure . 
Reportedly there was non - union of the fracture , so hardware was removed . 
Tissue appeared fairly healthy . 
She denies having any recent fevers , chills , night sweats , or particular pain in the ankle . 
She has been doing some weight bearing with use of a walker . 
She has had some mild serous drainage from the ankle , but no purulent drainage . 
ROS : See HPI for positives . 
ROS otherwise negative in detail . 
Metformin causes GI intolerance . 
Tylenol causes reaction . 
No tob , EtOH . 
The extent of infection is a surgical diagnosis . 
If the swabs were obtained from the superficial wound , then this may represent merely a wound infection which requires 2 weeks of antibiotics . 
However if the infection was felt on surgical inspection to extend to the region of the removed hardware , then this represents osteomyelitis by definition , and she will need 6 weeks of IV antibiotics with consideration of the removal of the remaining hardware . 
After discussion with the ortho resident , it seems that the culture was obtained from the site of screw removal . 
Thus , we have to assume hardware infection with concomitant osteomyelitis . 
Thus 6 weeks of IV antibiotics is necessary . 
We cannot rule out infection of the remaining hardware , however I understand the reluctance to remove the remainder of the hardware by the ortho service . 
Thus would pursue 6 week course of therapy , then monitor closely for signs of failure . 
We will continue to follow along with you . 
Thank you for the consult . 
Rosa Molina , M . D . 
She continues to complain of rare retrosternal chest discomfort only occasionally secondary to exertion . 
These episodes occur on a roughly once a month basis lasting anywhere from seconds to several minutes . 
Addition of long acting nitrates to her medical regimen has had no effect on the frequency or severity of this syndrome and she does not take Nitroglycerin for it . 
A stress test performed last January showed Mrs . Joshi exercising for 4 minutes and 3 0 seconds of a Bruce protocol stopping at a peak heart rate of 1 1 9 , peak blood pressure of 1 5 0 / 7 0 secondary to dyspnea . 
She had no ischemic EKG changes noted , however , a simultaneously obtained Sesta - MIBI scan revealed a minor fixed anterior wall defect as well as a small surrounding area of transient ischemia . 
In addition , there was a moderately severe fixed inferior wall defect again with peri - infarct mild ischemia . 
Of note , her last serum cholesterol was 2 6 6 with an HDL of 5 2 and an LDL of 1 9 2 . 
She remains on a regimen of Isosorbide mononitrate 6 0 mg p . o . 
Physical exam reveals a well nourished , overweight woman in no acute distress . 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 1 6 0 / 9 0 , heart rate 6 7 and regular , respirations 1 2 and unlabored , weight 2 6 4 pounds , which is six pounds above her weight of one year ago . 
The neck is supple . 
JVP flat . 
Carotids are 2 + without bruits . 
Cardiac exam reveals normal S 1 , physiologically split S 2 and a soft I / VI systolic ejection murmur . 
The abdomen is benign . 
Extremities without appreciable edema . 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 6 7 , P - R interval . 2 2 , QRS . 1 0 , Q - T . 3 6 , axis 2 0 degrees . 
There are isolated atrial premature depolarizations noted along with first degree AV block and a prior inferior posterior myocardial infarction with minor nonspecific ST and T wave changes . 
Compared to his last electrocardiogram there has been no significant change . 
I have asked her to begin Simvastatin at 2 0 mg p . o . 
In addition , I have asked her to obtain her blood pressure at least two or three more times on an ambulatory basis and told her that if she remained reliably above 1 4 0 / 8 5 then I would consider initiating pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy . 
In addition , as long as she remains active and asymptomatic , I will plan on repeating her exercise MIBI stress test in one to one and a half years time . 
Beyond this I have not altered her present regimen . 
Of course , I thank you for allowing me to assist in her care . 
She denies any other acute complaints . 
She denies nausea or vomiting or diaphoresis . 
Fundi was positive for AV - nicking . 
No S 3 , S 4 . 
No murmur . 
Pumex 2 mg p . o . 
The neck is soft . 
JVP is flat . 
Chest is clear . 
The abdomen is obese , but otherwise benign . 
Of course , I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care . 
Again , there was no acute change . 
Otherwise as per the written note . 
The patient works as an animal trainer . 
She lives with family . 
Moist mucous membranes . 
Sclerae are anicteric . 
Neck is supple . 
There is no dullness to percussion . 
Skin is warm , dry , and intact . 
Follows all commands appropriate . 
INR of 4 . 6 . 
The patient is in congestive heart failure . 
The source of her fever is not clear . 
UA is pending . 
Since last seen , she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn . 
By doing so , her creatinine fell from 2 . 2 to 1 . 6 and BUN from 1 1 7 to 5 7 . 
She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy , as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor . 
In addition , as part of her followup last March , she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 6 5 , peak blood pressure of 1 2 9 / 5 0 , stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol . 
Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 3 8 % with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall . 
Her rest - stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia . 
Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2 0 7 1 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 4 5 % with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis . 
In addition , at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2 0 7 1 . 
Currently , she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight , and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet . 
Presently , she continues on a regimen of Toprol - XL 3 7 . 5 mg p . o . 
Physical exam reveals a pleasant , mildly overweight woman in no acute distress . 
Blood pressure right arm sitting 1 2 0 / 5 2 , heart rate 4 5 and irregularly regular , respirations 1 4 and unlabored , and weight 2 5 3 pounds , which is 1 2 pounds above her weight of six months ago . 
The neck is supple . 
JVP is flat . 
Carotids are without significant bruits . 
Chest remains clear . 
Cardiac exam shows normal S 1 , physiologically split S 2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base . 
No significant diastolic murmur or rub . 
The abdomen is overweight , but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit . 
Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema . 
Peripheral pulses are detectable , albeit mildly diminished . 
Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds . 
There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T - wave changes . 
Compared with her last electrocardiogram , her heart rate at times is slower . 
I have asked her to decrease her Toprol - XL to 2 5 mg p . o . 
I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness . 
She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future . 
Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 1 8 3 ( she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you ) and in January , normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 3 0 4 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 1 3 4 , triglyceride of 7 4 , HDL 5 8 , and LDL 6 1 . 
She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low - saturated fat , low - cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy . 
She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency . 
In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease , it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor . 
At the present time , she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing . 
Other than reducing her beta - blocker regimen as described above , I have not further altered her current medical program . 
I thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care .

This was done by Dr . Winn , and Dr . Cook . 
Since then he has been tired , otherwise felt well . 
He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome . 
His blood sugars have been controlled recently with A 1 C ' s in the 6 range . 
He is overweight and does not do any regular exercise program . 
His current medications consist of aspirin 3 2 5 mg per day , Plavix 7 5 mg per day , Glucatrol 1 0 mg twice daily and Glucophage 5 0 0 mg twice daily , Atenolol 2 5 mg daily , Nexium 2 0 mg per day , Flomax . 4 and Zestril .

This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull , L fronto - temporal headache that persisted for several hours . 
She states she did not have word - finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself . 
The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1 - 2 hours before she resolved back to baseline . 
In addition to headache , associated symptoms included generalized weakness , feeling cold and mildly nauseated . 
She denied visual changes , chest pain , sob , palpitations , lightheadedness , vertigo , difficulty with swallowing , coordination or gait . 
She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low , without apparent effect . 
She recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed . 
The speech difficulty had resolved by morning , and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work - up . 
She has no known history of seizures . 
Migraines occur 1 - 2 x / year , preceeded by scintillating scotoma , associated with nausea , photophobia , relieved by sleep . 
Reports regular exercise including this morning ( stationary bicycle ) .

Dr . Remigio Allison was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work - up and treatment plan . 
We spent greater than 5 0 % of the visit in education and counseling of the patient and family . 
HPI : As you know , Ms . Klein is a 7 4 yo RH woman with history of HTN , hyperlipidemia , CAD s / p LAD stent ( 2 1 4 4 ) , migraine , who was in her USOH until the afternoon of 2 / 6 / 5 0 when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty " expressing myself " while cooking lunch for she and her husband . 
This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull , L fronto - temporal headache that persisted for several hours . 
She states she did not have word - finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself . 
In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors . 
The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1 - 2 hours before she resolved back to baseline . 
In addition to headache , associated symptoms included generalized weakness , feeling cold and mildly nauseated . 
She denied visual changes , chest pain , sob , palpitations , lightheadedness , vertigo , difficulty with swallowing , coordination or gait . 
She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low , without apparent effect . 
She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed . 
The speech difficulty had resolved by morning , and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work - up . 
Given her multiple vascular risk factors , she was admitted for TIA work - up which was unremarkable with the exception of mildly elevated HbA 1 c ( 7 . 0 ) including lipids , ESR , homocysteine , lipoprotein ( a ) , TTE and holter . 
CT / CT - a and MRI did not show any evidence of acute stroke or significant cervical or intracranial arterial stenosis . 
She was discharged on her home medications , which included ASA 3 2 5 mg po qd , with a diagnosis of complex migraine . 
Since return home , she has had additional typical episodes of migraine , ( about every 2 weeks ) without the aphasia which brought her into the hospital . 
She has tried Excedrin migraine a few times recently , with good results . 
She is awaiting thyroid biopsy of the nodules incidentally discovered on CT - CT - a . 
Negative in detail including change in weight , energy , appetite , CP , palpitations , SOB , DOE , N / V / D / cough , fever , chills , rash , BRBPR , melena , abdominal pain , change in bowel or bladder habits . 
In addition , patient denies change in vision , hearing , tinnitus , vertigo , numbness , weakness , slurred speech , difficulty with language , swallowing , eating , or gait . 
Denies tobacco , ETOH , or illicit drug use . 
No known history of stroke or migraine . 
Speech fluent w / o paraphasic errors ; comprehension , repetition , naming , reading , and writing intact . 
Memory : 3 / 3 w / o prompting at 5 min . 
WORLD , DOW backward without errors , serial 7 ' s intact ; No L / R confusion ; able to salute and brush teeth with either hand . 
Strength 5 / 5 throughout including : biceps , triceps , brachioradialis , finger flexors and extensors , hip , knee and ankle flexors and extensors . 
No pronator drift , cogwheeling or abnormal orbital movement . 
No fasciculations , no myoclonus . 
No extinction . 
Plantar response downgoing bilaterally . 
No Hoffman . 
Posture , stride , arm - swing normal . 
Able to walk on heels and toes . 
Tandem gait intact . 
Romberg negative . 
Multiple thyroid nodules . 
MRI Brain : No evidence of acute infarct , partially empty sella , nonspecific periventricular white matter T 2 hyperintensities consistent with small vessel disease . 
Since discharge , she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2 x / month . 
At this point , we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy , but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent . 
Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine , we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy , but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 1 0 - 1 4 days . 
We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA / stroke ; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non - stereotyped deficits seriously . 
She will follow - up with us in 4 - 6 months or sooner if the need arises . 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient . 
We look forward to seeing her in follow - up .

She is followed in rheumatology for mixed connective tissue disease . 
She was initially seen in March 2 0 9 4 , when she was admitted with fever , nausea and chest pain . 
Her chest CT showed an interstitial pattern and a patulous esophagus ; the interstitial lung disease was thought to be in part due to the mixed connective tissue disease and in part due to aspiration . 
She was also noted at that time to have an ANA 1 : 2 5 6 0 speckled with positive RNP , negative Scl - 7 0 . 
Clinically , she had Sjogren ' s with sclerodermatous changes to her hands and telangiectasias across her face . 
The Raynaud ' s was exacerbated by the extensive peripheral vascular disease and she had to undergo stenting of the right common femoral artery 1 1 / 2 0 9 5 . 
Slowly these lesions healed . 
Interim Issues : The diabetes and hypertension slowly became well controlled . 
But on exercise tolerance test , she presented with significant coronary artery disease and was noted to have significant aortic stenosis . 
In April 2 0 9 7 she underwent stenting and she had a prosthetic aortic valve placed . 
Recovering from surgery has been slow . 
But it has been steady and uncomplicated . 
She can now go up 2 flights of stairs , then rest to go the third flight to her home . 
She has had no recurrent chest pain . 
She keeps her hands and feet warm and has had no tissue damage . 
She feels a little tightness in the chest wall in taking a deep breath ( points anteriorly ) , but no dyspnea per se . 
She healed well postoperatively . 
She has recently been seen by cardiology and Dr . Nichols and seems to be in good shape . 
Her medications were reviewed and updated in the LMR . 
In terms of the MCTD , she continues to have some Raynaud ' s . 
She tries to keep her hands warm and she has had little breakdown of the tissue but rather thickening of her hands . 
What troubles her most is the intermittent synovitis . 
She felt much better on 5 mg of prednisone daily . 
She remains on Plaquenil 2 0 0 mg daily . 
She has had no worsening swallowing . 
She has had no fever , pneumonia or progressive dyspnea on exertion . 
She sleeps on two pillows . 
She denies waking up with any bitterness in her mouth . 
She continues on omeprazole . 
Complete ROS in detail is otherwise negative . 
Ms . Cantu went back to work 3 months after surgery . 
Hypertension . 
Peripheral artery disease . 
ASCVD with mild bilateral carotid stenosis ( 2 0 9 6 ) . 
Melanoma ( surgical resection right thigh in 2 0 7 7 ) . 
T & amp ; A . 
ALLERGIES : NKDA . 
She looks well to me . 
Her color is good and she smiles easily . 
She has profound dryness of her mouth , but no particular injection of her eyes . 
Her neck is reasonably supple , the skin tightened here . 
Perhaps tightened a bit over her face as well . 
But the chest wall itself has no scleroderma . 
The midline scar has healed beautifully . 
The respiratory excursions appear full . 
There is no splinting . 
There are some bilateral crackles . 
Her hands are thickened from the scleroderma aspect of her disease . 
There are no nail bed infarcts . 
There is some peripheral pitting of digits . 
Her feet are well healed , warm and well perfused . 
Her joints are benign today with no active synovitis . 
Heart : S 1 , S 2 with a soft crisp , S 2 noted . 
No insufficiency murmurs . 
PVD . 
Continue Prilosec , refill Plaquenil Prescribe prednisone 5 mg p . r . n . 
I think it would be safe for her to take every morning as long as her diabetes remains well controlled and she feels much better on it ; that is , the benefits outweigh the risks . 
Her labs have been sent and a chest x - ray obtained . 
I will see her in 6 months , sooner if there are any issues in the interim . 
Interview time 4 5 minutes due to medical history review , questions and verification of medications with the patient . 
She and her husband agree with this plan . 
AVR . 
Coronary stents . 
There is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema . 
Just hospitalized while I was away on vacation with DOE and cath showed multivessel CAD . 
Had PTCA of his RCA and was transfused for worse anemia . 
Feels less dyspneic . 
It has been difficult to arrange a colonoscopy . 
Noted to have some afib but not anticoagulated secondary to anemia . 
Has some low back pain radiating into his thighs when he walks very far . 
His wife is concerned about the amount of alcohol he was drinking and Dr . Estrella at the Newton Hosp has ordered a strict limit of 1 oz . 
Retired . 
No cigarettes . 
Thigh aching . 
Fatigue . 
Rest of ROS is negative . 
No audible murmurs or gallops . 
Abd : Obese . 
Non tender . 
Ext : No edema . 
Trace DP pulses . 
He has a chronic hx of mild anemia in the past . 
Our endoscopy service is overwhelmed at this point . 
Referred to the Fairfield . 
Will switch back to Cozaar . 
Continue Actos and Glucotrol . 
Would not advocate surgery . 
This has been sporadic in the past . 
Add : 1 2 lead EKG in the office shows him to be in AF at 5 2 with PRWP and T wave abnormalities . 
We will need to expedite his GI w / u so we can start anticoagulation . 
He has had some pain in his buttocks when he ambulates a short distance which resolves with standing still . 
Hip films were unremarkable . 
No calf pains . 
He saw Dr . Jaimes for a second opinion and was advised to exercise more and cut down on alcohol . 
He has had some anemia and his GI w / u at Fairfield was negative . 
I then started him on Coumadin which he finally started taking . 
Retired . 
No cigarettes . 
Thigh aching . 
Fatigue . 
Rest of ROS is negative . 
No retinopathy . 
No lymphadenopathy . 
No carotid bruits . 
No audible murmurs or gallops . 
Abd : Obese . 
Non tender . 
Ext : No edema . 
Trace PT pulse on the right . 
Could not palpate any on the left . 
Probably spinal stenosis but I will check some vascular studies . 
I referred him to Dr . Emmons in Hematology today . 
Continue Actos and Glucotrol . 
I explained to him that I am a cardiologist as well and that I have found in the past it does not work out well to have two cardiologists involved in his care . 
I think Dr . Jaimes is a superb cardiologist and I gave him the number for GCH teleservices to find himself a new internist . 
He clearly is somewhat conflicted about this and will think about it . 
His major concern is results of recent vascular studies . 
He has known diabetes and has a history of several years of exertional cramping and discomfort in his legs . 
This occurs only with heavy exertion . 
Dr . Bridges documented normal pedal pulses the last visit . 
His recent vascular studies showed no significant drop off and perfusion pressures level of the ankle . 
Did given his history a more inclined to suspect this might be pseudoclaudication due to neuropathy or spinal stenosis . 
He will follow up with Dr . Bridges about next steps . 
Ret he declines a flu shot today . 
He denies fever . 
He denies any other acute complaints . 
The resident ' s note was reviewed . 
The patient was interviewed . 
The patient was examined by me . 
Fundi were benign . 
No S 3 , S 4 . 
Negative Babinski . 
Also negative for interstitial edema . 
I last saw his blood sugar and it was 2 7 6 and his A 1 c in October was 7 . 
So , I had him back today to discuss diabetic management and also review his general health in terms of his diabetes and his other medications . 
We went over his medications to start with and he is taking them exactly as it was shown in the computer . 
These include atenolol 2 5 , Glucotrol 1 0 twice a day , Actos 4 5 , Lipitor 4 0 a day , Lasix 4 0 a day , and Procardia XL 6 0 mg q . d . , and Coumadin . 
He is followed by Dr . Itzel Jaimes for his cardiac problems and by a diabetologist at the Claiborne for managing his diabetes . 
He had no other complaints . 
His bowel movements are regular . 
He still has nocturia x 3 and was recently seen by a urologist who felt there was no need for any intervention . 
He otherwise was in good spirits and has no immediate complaints . 
His social situation , his allergies and and his family history and past medical history , are overall as previously recorded . 
There are no other pertinent findings in the review of systems . 
He looks well . 
I did not measure his weight . 
His heart rate was around 6 4 - 6 8 . 
His pupils are equal and reactive to light and extraocular movements were full . 
Mucous membranes of the mouth and tongue were normal . 
Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation . 
Cardiac exam showed regular sinus rhythm , a normal S 2 and no significant murmurs . 
Liver and spleen were not palpable . 
He had only 1 + peripheral edema which is less than usual . 
He will come back to see me in about a month ' s time to follow up on these issues . 
The patient was seen with Dr . Jarman . 
He seemed to have his eyes roll back in his head . 
There was no definite tonic - clonic movement . 
No history of trauma . 
THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY . 
PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE . 
He was brought to the PH ED yesterday by his wife , who noted that he was lethargic and confused for 3 days ( reportedly similar to previous UTI presentations ) . 
She felt that his urine output had decreased at home , and that his urine had been foul - smelling for two days . 
He was treated empirically with levofloxacin and transfused 2 U PRBC for HCT 2 6 . 
His Cr was elevated at 3 . 1 , and his K was 6 . 4 . 
He was admitted to a telemetry bed on the medical service for management of the above issues . 
The patient has been hemodynamically stable , and his only subjective complaint has been general malaise . 
We are consulted with the question of whether his stents may be changed during his current admission . 
His U / A and UCx are not overwhelmingly c / w a UTI , but his clinical presentation was reportedly similar to prior UTI presentations . 
He is being managed by ID . 
His ureteral stents were last changed 2 / 9 4 , but he has never obtained a diagnosis for his B ureteral obstruction . 
His abdominal CT is pending . 
He remains clinically stable , with significantly improved cognition and awareness since admission . 
As such , we recommend : - - F / U UCx and ID recs , as you are doing . 
Depending on the results of this study , we will consider ureteral stent change vs . staged removal . 
Regardless of his eventual stent plan , he should be medically cleared for an operative procedure , which would entail stabilization of his hyperkalemia prior to undergoing anaesthesia . 
D / w Dr . Ferreira , who agrees with above plan . 
Thank you for allowing us to continue our involvement in the care of this unfortunate patient .

He is a former patient of Dr . Ilya Light . 
He is a 5 9 - year - old man with diabetes type 2 , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , and mild coronary artery disease who had a brief episode of atrial flutter in 2 0 6 9 . 
He presented in 2 0 6 9 with chest pain and rapid heart rate following snow shoveling . 
He was found to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response . 
He was cardioverted two days later and has remained in sinus rhythm since then . 
Echocardiogram performed on 0 2 / 2 2 / 2 0 6 9 showed normal ejection fraction of 7 2 % , borderline left atrium at 4 3 mm , and no significant valvular abnormalities . 
Stress test performed on 0 3 / 1 6 / 2 0 6 9 showed 5 minutes of exercise , 7 METS , and a peak double product of 2 2 , 0 0 0 . 
He had no EKG changes , and a small mild posterobasilar defect suggestive of a very limited area of mild ischemia . 
The patient has been managed medically since then . 
He has used an event monitor and since then has not had any subsequent episodes of atrial flutter or fibrillation . 
The patient has been doing well over the past several months . 
Currently , he exercises once or twice a week by swimming 3 0 minutes in a pool . 
A few months ago , he was exercising almost everyday . 
His weight has been up and down . 
He does not complain of any chest pain , shortness of breath , or other symptoms . 
Occasionally in the morning when he takes his pulse , he notices a skipped beat . 
I have reassured him that this is not a cause for concern . 
PMI is discrete and nondisplaced . 
Regular rate and rhythm with normal S 1 and S 2 . 
His Pravachol dose has been increased since this time . 
He is doing well . 
He had an episode of atrial flutter for two days in 2 0 6 9 but has not had any repeat episodes . 
He is currently not anticoagulated . 
Given new recommendations , his target LDL should be less than 7 0 . 
He is due for a fasting lipid profile in one week . 
If his LDL is not below 7 0 , then he should either be switched to Lipitor 8 0 mg day or Zetia should be added to his present regimen . 
He is slightly hypertensive today with a blood pressure of 1 4 0 / 7 5 . 
The patient will check his blood pressure at home since he is somewhat anxious male .

Pateint is a 6 9 year old male scheduled for a right femoral popliteal BPG . 
Patient has history of HTN , CAD S / P CABG X 3 , hypercholesterolemia , non insulin dependent diabete , hiatal hernia , and rheumatoid arthritis . 
He denies problems with general anesthesia . 
Anesthesia consent form reviewed and explained . Patient requests to sign anesthesia consent form day of surgery . 
Similar to previous EKG from cardiologist office . 
Formal reading pending . 
He came back from Pennsylvania after being there about a month . 
He has had an eventful past six months . 
In October , he apparently had a TIA or small stroke . 
He was evaluated with an MRA of his neck and was told that there was not enough blockage to warrant surgery . 
His symptomatology fortunately clear . 
His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity . 
About this time , he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe . 
He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin . 
Not long after this , he went into renal failure . 
He was told that they could not tell if that was due to the antibiotics or the gadolinium . 
According to the patient and his wife , his creatinine went as high as 9 . 
Fortunately , it is currently back down to 2 . 4 . 
His toe lesion has been very slow to improve . 
He describes pain in the toe and often has to sleep in a chair with his foot dependent . 
He has seen various physicians and podiatrists in Pennsylvania , without much improvement . 
They finally told him , he would do well to come back here for further care and evaluation . 
On examination today , I can feel femoral and popiteal pulses . 
I do not feel any definite pedal pulses on either side but noninvasive study show good pulsatile flow at the calf and transmetatarsal level . 
Resting ABI is good , although his diabetic calcinosis probably makes this unreliable . 
He has some slight pulsatile flow at the right toe level and flat tracings at left toes . 
He has 1 cm escharover the dorsum of his second toe . 
There is some erythema of the toe and proximal dorsal forefoot . 
This certainly has the appearance of some cellulites . 
There is minimal to no swelling of the toe . 
We will place him on Keflex 2 5 0 mg q . i . d . 
I will refer him to Dr . Caldwell for recommendations regarding wound quick care and an opinion whether or not hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be worth considering . 
I do not think there is anything further we can do to improve his distal blood flow . 
Further imaging will also be very difficult in view of the possible problems with gadolinium as well as his creatinine , which limit contrast administration . 
His noninvasive studies suggest that his problems are all diabetic small vessel disease and it is unlikely that we could be of benefit with this . 
I will await Dr . Caldwell & # 8 2 1 7 ; s opinions . 
The patient has developed progressive R calf pain over the past 2 months , which has become worse over the past 1 0 days . 
He is unable to walk more than a half block without cramping pain in his calf . 
Because of his previous bypass surgery and current complaints , he underwent vascular studies today demonstrating critical atherosclerotic disease in the RLE , with markedly reduced flow through the R graft . 
Over the past week , the patient reports that his pain has become more severe . 
He has otherwise felt well and in his normal state of health , and denies fevers / chills , chest pain , shortness of breath , and all other symptoms . 
He lives with his wife in SC but winters at their home in PA . 
He is a former smoker . 
He quit smoking approx 1 5 years ago . 
Denies ETOH or illicit drug use . 
No signs of loss of sensation or tingling are apparent on examination of right foot . 
His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia , presumably the result of graft stenosis . 
He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service , be placed on systemic heparin , and will undergo angiogram in the next 1 - 2 days for possible angioplasty / stent . 
The case was complicated by large blood loss anemia and hypotension . 
In the PACU the patient continued to be hypotensive and have low uop . 
We placed a central line ( starting CVP was 0 ) and continued resuscitation . 
The patient developed ST changes and also had acute on chronic renal failure ( RIFLE F ) . 
WE transfused and transferred him to the ICU . 
We discussed this at length with the surgical service as well as cardiology . 
I examined the patient reviewed the chart and discussed the case . 
Will give aspirin and lower HR to 7 0 ' s with Beta blockers . 
Contue statin . 
Will give fluids and transfuse the patient . 
Will get echo in am . 
We will for now give volume . 
Acute renal failure : He has significantly decreaed uop . 
Will increase filling pressures . 
For now would not use furosemide given low central filling pressures .

Five days PTA , the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3 rd floor . 
He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue . 
Over the next few days , his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest . 
His SOB would awaken him from his sleep , occurring 3 - 4 x / night . 
He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND . 
The Pt sleeps on one pillow . 
During the course of his worsening SOB , his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2 . 5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1 . 5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB . 
These episodes of SOB were not associated w / CP ( pleuritic or otherwise ) , palpitations , F / C , N / V , diaphoresis , abdominal discomfort , or pain in his arms or jaw . 
Also during this time , the Pt noted progressive b / l swelling of his legs ( from ankles to knees ) and increasing abdominal girth . 
He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them . 
The LE swelling were not associated w / calf pain . 
On the day before admission , however , he did develop a non - productive , dry cough . 
On the DOA , his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor . 
He was subsequently driven to NYSH - East by his wife and son , where he was seen and then re - directed to NYSH . 
At NYSH - East , the Pt ' s vitals were : T 9 7 . 6 P 5 2 - 5 5 BP 1 6 7 / 7 7 O 2 Sat 9 8 % Wt 1 8 8 . 5 # w / clothes . 
The Pt received Lasix 4 0 mg IV and O 2 @ 3 L / min . 
Since receiving the Lasix , the Pt ' s LE edema has drastically diminished , and the Pt states that he feels a lot better . 
The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction ( he uses salt 2 - 3 x / wk ) . 
He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds . 
He states that he does not drink alcohol and quit smoking 2 0 years ago after having smoked 2 cigars / day for 2 0 yrs . 
He denies using illicit drugs . 
He has 2 pitbulls at home and has no recent travels . 
FAMILY Hx : No FHx of HTN , DM , hyperlipidemia , or cancer . 
HEENT : No HA , vision changes , auras , or injuries . 
CV / Resp : See HPI .

Motor 5 / 5 throughout except L arm , which was limited by pain . 
DTR ' s not appreciated in any of the extremities ( triceps , brachioradialis , knees , and ankles ) . 
Biphasic TW in V 2 - V 4 . 
LVH by voltage criteria . 
No difference from past EKGs . 
Lung fields are clear . 
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged . 
Right sided diaphragmatic hernia , unchanged . 
No evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease . 
PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out . 
Consider D - dimer to rule out recent PE . 
PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC . 
PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out , although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs , and the onset was not acute . 
The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely ; however , the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility . 
PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss . 
Will start the Pt on O 2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics , beta - blockers , and ACE - I . 
Will consider the addition of spironolactone . 
Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any . 
Order LFT ' s to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs . 
Monitor UOP for kidney functions . 
Monitor EKG for any changes . 
Will send for a D - dimer to r / o recent PE . 
Will also be treated using meds for CHF . 
Will treat w / his home medication of glucophage and glyburide . 
Cont home medication of Lipitor . 
Consider a diabetic diet as well . 
Agree with overall assessment above . 
DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP , nausea , vomiting , and diaphoresis , although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine . 
Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP , absence of crackles , 2 / 6 SEM at LLSB and apex , and mild , symmetric , pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities . 
Per chart notes , in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins . 
Favor CHF > ? pacer malfunction , ischemia > PE . 
CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L - sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data ( no crackles on exam , CXR clear ) to suggest this . 
Prior to our evaluation he received 4 0 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter ( with subjective improvement ) , which may account for this discrepancy . 
Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function , pacer interrogation , and stress . 
D - dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low - prob possibility . 
Has been feeling well . 
No severe hypoglycemia . 
Has had a couple of nocturnal reactions . 
There are not enough data points to determine whether the Lantus dose is appropriate . 
Has had extensive laser in the past , and had some last year OS after her surgery .

Check BP at home . 
She would like to consider treatment for onychomycosis . 
Would suggest that Dr . Xie send a paring for fungal culture before we consider it . 
Also , LFTs were slightly abnormal in July and will need to be repeated . 
Finally , would have to check medication incompatibilities before proceeding . 
Refer to Dr . xia for consideration of modification of her sternotomy scar . 
Warned her that he may not feel that it is a good idea either on pure surgical grounds on because of her immunosuppression , but it is worth asking his opinion . 
Refer to Dr . Keeler for evaluation of scalp lesions .

ETT with sestamibi . 
Try to get flu shot locally . 
If unsuccessful , call here every few weeks to see whether we have them . 
Her ETT showed mild distal anterior and antero - apical ischemia . 
The last p - CABG ETT was done in September , 2 0 7 4 , and did not included nuclear images . 
The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate . 
Dr . Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose . 
Since she has had low BP in the past , we increased it to only 2 5 / 1 2 . 5 . 
BP 8 0 / 5 0 - 9 0 / 6 0 at home and she has not felt so well , tired .

Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days . 
He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and ( expired ) nitroglycerine SL just in case . 
He had an anteroseptal MI in 2 0 9 2 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack . 
Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about , called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain . 
On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain .

Her electrolytes are within normal limits . 
Her BUN is 1 8 , creatinine 0 . 8 , and glucose 1 1 2 . 
Her MB was 0 . 4 . 
Her d - dimer is less than 2 0 0 . 
Her INR is 1 . 1 . 
This 6 6 - year - old woman phoned my office complaining of exertional chest discomfort . 
We instructed her to presented to the Emergency Department at Davis Monthan Hospital . 
She had experienced multiple episodes of chest pressure with exertion lasting 5 - 1 0 minutes and radiating to her left axilla . 
On 1 0 / 3 0 / 2 0 8 5 , she suffered non - ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in Pennsylvania and was managed with percutaneous coronary intervention . 
Chest discomfort recurred and on 1 1 / 0 3 / 2 0 8 5 , she was recatheterized at Davis Monthan Hospital where her mid LAD stent was expanded . 
She has had worsening substernal chest discomfort over the past two to three days . 
Her discomfort is relieved with nitroglycerin . 
Overnight , she had on and off chest discomfort with anterior T - wave lability . 
She was placed on intravenous heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin . 
She suffered pulmonary embolism in 2 0 7 4 . 
That is when I first met her . 
She has gastroesophageal reflux disease . 
She is married ; her husband works at 2 4 Hour Fitness as a personal trainer in the weight room . 
She does not smoke cigarettes . 
She has four children . 
Home medications include aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily , atenolol 2 5 mg daily , Lipitor 8 0 mg daily , Plavix 7 5 mg daily , insulin , and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed . 
The review of systems is negative other than the above . 
On physical examination , she appears well .

On cardiac examination , she has a regular rhythm with a normal S 1 , single S 2 , and no murmur , rub , or gallop . 
Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly . 
The legs have no clubbing or cyanosis , but there is right leg greater than left leg edema . 
The skin has no rash . 
My assessment is that Irene Zastrow has " small vessel " coronary artery disease in addition to epicardial coronary artery disease . 
We will intensify her medical regimen by prescribing higher doses of beta blockade and by initiating a long - acting nitrate . 
We will also repeat the chest CT scan to make sure she has not suffered from recurrent pulmonary embolism . 
I discussed this plan with her , her husband , and the medical house staff . 
At that time , she had a drug - eluting stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery . 
On 1 1 / 0 3 / 2 0 8 5 , she had repeat percutaneous coronary intervention because of persistent chest pain and required an additional inflation and reexpansion of the drug - eluting stent . 
On 1 2 / 0 7 / 2 0 8 5 , she had repeated cardiac catheterization because of chest pain but no additional percutaneous coronary intervention was required . 
She feels that she is having less chest discomfort as we have " ramped up " her cardiac medications . 
She has no shortness of breath . 
She does get occasional abdominal pulsations . 
She does get epigastric discomfort . 
Current medications include ranolazine 1 0 0 0 mg twice daily , aspirin 3 2 5 mg once daily , Plavix 7 5 mg once daily , isosorbide mononitrate 3 0 mg once daily , Lipitor 2 0 mg daily , and insulin .

Abdomen has no masses or hepatomegaly . 
The legs have no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . 
The skin has no rash . 
Irene Zastrow is improving from the clinical cardiovascular view point . 
I will obtain an exercise treadmill test using the standard Bruce protocol to obtain additional objective data . 
Although theoretically she should not have acid secretion due to pernicious anemia , I do suspect she has acid reflux , and I am reinstituting today Prilosec 2 0 mg twice daily . 
I am ordering an abdominal ultrasound to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm due to her complaint of episodic abdominal severe pulsations . 
I reassured her and told her she is clinically improving . 
I will plan to see her again in about four months . 
Best personal regards . 
We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring . 
We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments . 
Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars . 
She brings them in today and the results look excellent . 
She has had no other concerns of late . 
We have not tested her hemoglobin A 1 c in a long period of time , so she comes in today for further evaluation .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : 1 . 
Ms . Zastrow is a 6 7 - year - old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes . 
She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made . 
We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control . 
We will check a hemoglobin A 1 c today . 
She is up - to - date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed . 
Cardiovascular . 
She is doing well on her current regimen . 
She is on ranolazine and will continue with this . 
Neck pain . 
Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease . 
I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning . 
I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain , but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time . 
She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy . 
I did recommend that she get one in the near future . 
Normal vaginal vault , no adnexal fullness felt . 
Vaginal Pap was taken . 
Greater than 5 0 % of our 6 0 - minute visit was spent going over her pump settings , the appropriate levels for her pump , going over her diet , going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool . 
He has limited his activities to prevent symptoms . 
He also has had a few episodes at rest in bed . 
Stress test at BII showed inferoposterior ischemia at low workload - - - 3 : 1 8 minutes HR 1 0 1 ( 7 2 % ) and b / p 2 2 0 / 8 0 . 
LV EF 4 8 % . 
He presents today for cardiac cath . 
Full cath report not available but d / w Dr . Diamond states no intervention needed . 
Case complicated by back discomfort and urge to void - - Foley insertion requiring Coude . 
He will stay overnight and receive Abx . 
He is pain free currently . 
Son with patient . 
CNIS - no significant obstruction , plague . 
Cooks for self . 
Helps out occasionally . 
Good historian . 
CV : Continue home medications . 
Speak with Dr . Diamond regarding ASA - he has only taken x 2 weeks . 
PV : to return in a few weeks for PV intervention . 
Endo : Hold glucophage . 
Follow bid finger sticks and use sliding scale insulin prn . 
Further plans per Dr . Diamond . 
As you know , he is a patient that has known coronary artery disease , for which I ended up doing a catheterization on 0 8 / 2 7 / 2 1 5 7 , and that was done because of an abnormal stress test and chest pain . 
At that time , he had been evaluated by Dr . Morgan Thayer , who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia , a low workload of 3 minutes and 1 8 seconds , and a heart rate of only 7 2 % of predicted . 
The LV chamber was dilated , and the ejection fraction was estimated at 4 8 % , and there was a suggestion of global ischemia . 
The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease , plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree , some calcification , and narrow caliber vessels overall , but no focal high - grade stenoses . 
There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery , but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply . 
He was treated medically for the coronary artery disease . 
At the time of his cath , he also underwent an angiography of his abdominal aorta and selective angiogram of his left leg , because he was complaining of claudication predominantly on the left calf at that time . 
That study demonstrated the presence of two renal arteries of the left side , a small superior one that was narrowed by about 5 0 % , and a larger inferior left renal artery that was narrowed by about 6 0 % . 
The right side was patent . 
With respect to the abdominal aorta , there was an ulcerated plaque just below the superior renal artery , narrowing the channel in the aorta by about 3 0 % or 4 0 % . 
The iliac vessels were patent , and the left common femoral artery had some irregularity that was patent . 
The left SFA , a diffusely diseased vessel , had a high - grade stenosis of about 8 0 % in the adductor canal . 
Then , at the trifurcation , there was occlusion or high - grade stenosis of all three trifurcation vessels on the left side . 
There was reconstitution at the level of the ankle . 
The decision at that time was made to treat him conservatively , at least for the present , since he was still playing golf three to four times a week . 
He also apparently had some other issues , so I never saw him again in followup . 
The original plan had been to bring him back for revascularization of his left renal artery and the left SFA . 
He did have back surgery about a year ago when he became significantly crippled by his lumbar spinal stenosis . 
Dr . Anders Sykes performed an L 3 - L 4 , L 4 - L 5 decompressive laminectomy . 
This had a dramatically positive effect on his back pain . 
The biggest problem now is that he feels that he cannot walk as far and his exercise tolerance has decreased . 
He has been an avid golfer in the past , but is now having some more difficulty with that . 
Even when I saw him two years ago , he was using a cart to play three or four times a week . 
He still is able to play golf , but if he walks about 1 0 0 yards , he starts feeling his calves , and now the symptoms are bilateral and equal . 
He also has some numbness in his toes , which is constant , and his feet feel cold much of the time . 
The symptoms of claudication have increased over the past couple of years . 
His blood pressure has been reasonably stable . 
He tells me that you get pressures of 1 2 0 - 1 3 0 . 
He has not been taking his blood pressure at home , but he does take a fair amount of medication , see below . 
Of note , his son says that when he was in Michigan , he was playing 1 8 holes of golf regularly , sometimes a couple of times per day , but Haas notes that he was indeed limited by claudication even though he was able to play the golf down in Michigan . 
He seems to be more limited up here since returning just a short time ago . 
He also says that he feels like he has got to stay on the move , and if he does not play any golf at all , he will really deteriorate . 
Of note , the discomfort is not only limited to the calves , but also there is some discomfort in the hips , though not nearly as bad and not as limiting . 
At this point , he feels that he cannot walk as well or enough to follow through on his instructions . 
Diabetes , type 2 . 
Hypertension , with blood pressures as high as 2 2 0 at times in the past . 
Carotid bruits , though I do not have any readings from a Duplex ultrasound that was done a couple of years ago or so . 
Hyperlipidemia . 
Remote history of smoking , quit 4 0 years ago or so after 2 0 years of smoking . 
Peripheral neuropathy . 
Coronary artery disease , as described . 
Renal artery stenosis and PVD . 
Currently retired . 
Plays golf a lot . 
Likes to maintain a high level of activity . 
Has two sons , one in Lake Wildwood , another in Baldwin City . 
He has a daughter in Michigan . 
Grandchildren - several . 
He also has a great grandchild . 
No smoking currently and only drinks occasional beer . 
Occasional cup of coffee . 
He denies neurologic symptoms , sweats , fever , chills , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , bloody stools , or hemoptysis . 
He does have night cramps and frequent urination at night . 
He says he has some problems with vision with some intermittent blurring of his vision , but no monocular blindness . 
He is set up to see an ophthalmologist soon . 
EOMI . 
Bilateral bruits present , soft . 
Below this , feet are warm and well perfused , with 1 + edema bilaterally . 
Trace pulses in the dorsalis pedis on both sides , not sure how well I am feeling them . 
Popliteal pulses are trace to 1 + . 
No ulcers or gangrene . 
Normal axis and intervals , very minor nonspecific ST - T wave abnormality , essentially normal tracing . 
Obtain MRA of abdominal aorta , renal , and run - off arteries down to the ankle . 
This will help give us a road map as to how we can approach revascularization of his legs to make him feel better . 
I already know that I can open up his left SFA and probably his left trifurcation vessels below the knee , but I would like to see the right side and also get another look at the aortoiliac vessels , since it has been a full two years . 
Continue appropriate risk factor modification as you are doing . 
We will obtain blood work today in preparation for revascularization . 
I need to get carotid noninvasive studies , since it has been a couple of years anyway . 
Peripheral arterial disease - progressive claudication , now involving both legs at an equal amount and limiting him in terms of daily activities . 
We know that he has high - grade disease in the left leg , below the groin , which can be treated . 
Right leg has not been examined in the past . 
Also has an ulcerative plaque in the aorta , which might be best left alone . 
Renal vascular disease - known moderately severe stenosis left main and accessory renal arteries . 
Blood pressure is under reasonable control . 
Need to check his creatinine and BUN . 
If they are okay , then we would leave him alone . 
He is however on a total of six antihypertensive medications , so consideration of renal artery revascularization is certainly something to entertain . 
Coronary artery disease - stable . 
Diabetes . 
Spinal stenosis - better since back surgery . 
I will certainly keep you updated as to his clinical course . 
The pt reports bloating + nausea after eating as well as occasional RUQ pain over the preceding 3 months . 
He also reports an ~ 1 0 lb wt loss over this period . 
The IMA is occluded . 
There are two left renal arteries . 
There is a circumaortic left renal vein . 
The kidneys are unremarkable . 
The liver , pancreas , spleen , and adrenal glands are unremarkable . 
There is no intra - abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy .

There are no bony lytic or blastic lesions . 
The visualized lungs are clear . 
There are no pleural effusions . 
No significant mesenteric arterial compromise .

We will plan for further evaluation of the patient & # 8 2 1 7 ; s biliary system with an ERCP . 
Given the location of the largest stone i . e . 
I have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate .

He has not felt his AICD fire . 
He has had no lightheadedness or weakness . 
He continues on atenolol , aspirin , folate , furosemide , insulin , lisinopril , simvastatin and Viagra . 
There is no increase in jugular venous pressure . 
Carotids are without bruits . 
Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout . 
Cardiovascular exam is notable for nondisplaced PMI , S 1 , physiologically split S 2 with systolic ejection murmur and a soft holosystolic apical murmur . 
Abdomen is soft , nontender , free of organomegaly and bruits . 
Extremities are warm and free of edema with symmetric pulses , motor strength , and sensation . 
Given his current levels of stress , we are going to change his atenolol to 1 0 0 mg in the morning and 5 0 mg at night , and I have encouraged him to get to a target weight of 1 9 0 this year , and I am making no other changes in his medical regimen . 
He is a nonsmoker , does not use IV drugs , he is responsible to take care of several sick individuals that are very close to his life , therefore he claims he cannot attention to his own personal health because of caring for others . 
The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton ' s , they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic , lack of control over the years . 
He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet . 
After a while , his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report . 
He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes . 
He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain , shortness of breath or PND . 
He sees Dr . Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint . 
With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device . 
He reports no fever , shakes , chills , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea . 
Again , he has had no recent chest pain , PND , or orthopnea . 
He has had no dysphagia , odynophagia , melena , hematemesis , hematochezia , dysuria , hematuria or polyuria .

Sinuses were nontender . 
Nostrils were patent . 
Neck is supple Supple without JVD , lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly . 
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes , rubs or rhonchi . 
Heart regular rate and rhythm , normal S 1 , S 2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops were appreciated . 
Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended . 
He has a small umbilical hernia that is not protruding and bowel sounds are active . 
He has no organomegaly and there is no CVA tenderness . 
Extremities are without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . 
He does have significant thickening and brittleness of the toenails of both feet consistent with onychomycosis . 
He has no open sores of the feet . 
Neurologically , he is alert and oriented x 3 and grossly nonfocal with intact distal sensation to light touch in both feet . 
He has no generalized lymphadenopathy and his joint examination shows no effusions or erythema . 
Annual physical , preventative maintenance . 
The patient had a colonoscopy in 2 1 2 5 and was told to come back in 2 1 3 0 because of benign polyps . 
I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes . 
Immunizations are up - to - date . 
He did receive an H 1 N 1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies . 
His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years ' time . 
We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today . 
Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC , CMP , and lipid profile . 
The patient is declining Zostavax at this time . 
We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical . 
Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes . 
The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet , although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar . 
Recommend checking a hemoglobin A 1 c today , urine for microalbumin , lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR . 
I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 4 2 units daily , but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A 1 c remains elevated despite dietary improvement . 
We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control . 
I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months . 
Obesity . 
We will check a TSH , lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance . 
I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history . 
CAD with history of DVT . 
He has had an ICD interrogated recently . 
We will check a lipid panel today . 
We would like to strive for an LDL less than 7 0 given his high risk status , I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point . 
The patient fell down a couple weeks ago on ice and landed on his left shoulder , sustaining a proximal humeral fracture that is currently well aligned . 
The patient was seen by orthopedics at the Boulder County Hospital , he was told to have no work for the next 3 months . 
He also received reports no chest pain , PND or orthopnea , he also denies any AICD firing , and reports only occasional low blood sugar reactions . 
He has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes , he currently uses NPH insulin 4 2 units daily with sliding scale to 3 times a day at a maximal 8 units at a time . 
He reports no polyuria or polydipsia . 
His only risk doctor for fracture includes a low testosterone diagnosed about 3 years ago . 
He is currently on no replacement for testosterone , and only recently started calcium and vitamin D after his fracture . 
He has not had an eye examination in over a year . 
Proximal humeral fracture - the patient will be out of work for 3 months , and is really taking calcium and vitamin D twice a day , and strong he recommended a bone density test for future should fracture assessment given his low testosterone 3 years ago , the patient is not willing to schedule it today , but will call me in the next month to do so he is on Ultram on a p . r . n . 
Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes - will recommend hemoglobin A 1 c , lipid profile , and urine for microalbumin as well as a TSH , and considered poor the patient from NPH to Lantus or possible to 7 0 / 3 0 insulin , with the patient might ask her benefit with formal endocrine consultation given his poor glycemic control and history of cardiac disease . 
CAD - will check his lipid panel tonight , aiming for an LDL of below 1 0 0 ___________________________Robert Lincoln , M . D .

Given her new onset of chest pain , and recent return to smoking , we have asked her to stop smoking and call us in 2 weeks to report any change in her chest pain . 
If at that time , the pain has persisted we will obtain an ETT without imaging ; if her pain has resolved with smoking cessation we will ask her to follow up with her PCP to continue with smoking cessation plan . 
We have asked that she have Dr . Paulette Yancy fax us a copy of her most recent lipid profile for our records and have reiterated the LDL goal of less than 1 0 0 for secondary prevention of strokes .

His last visit was in December 2 0 7 5 , following which he had a routine stress test . 
He had been planning to do some skiing over January , and we wanted to give him clearance to do so . 
His stress test was done on 1 - 4 - 7 6 , and revealed mild apical ischemia . 
He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test . 
Based on these findings , we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities . 
Unfortunatley , he was never able to ski over January anyway due to a bout with pneumonia . 
He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring " rarely " , but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol . 
The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2 - 3 times per week . 
He says it is not really shortness of breath , but an awareness that something feels different . 
He is able to continue his usual activities , including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty . 
He denies any chest discomfort , palpitations , rapid heart action , dizziness or syncope .

He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking . 
He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm . 
He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild - to - moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . 
He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2 0 8 4 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2 0 9 7 with an old inferior MI and peri - infarct ischemia . 
He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog , but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest . 
He has not had any rest pain . 
For his increasing angina , he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month , but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta . 
He then had a left brachial artery . 
Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 7 0 - 8 0 % distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory . 
There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main , but the documentation of this was not clear . 
With the complexity of his anatomy , he is referred for further evaluation . 
He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago , does not drink alcohol . 
He is married and lives in Missouri . 
Blood pressure of 1 2 8 / 6 0 , pulse of 6 0 - 7 0 and room air sat of 9 9 % . 
He had no jugular venous distention . 
Chest was clear . 
Heart had normal S 1 and S 2 . 
No S 3 or S 4 . 
There is a 2 / 6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border . 
His abdomen was benign . 
Extremities showed no peripheral edema , but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler . 
His labs showed a BUN / creatinine of 2 1 / 1 . 3 , glucose 1 4 5 and hematocrit of 4 0 % . 
We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease . 
We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve . 
We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta . 
Mr . Ehlers is POD 1 , s / p C 4 . 
His family history is positive for diabetes ( mother diagnosed in her 8 0 s ) . 
He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop . 
He is now on a full liquid diet . 
Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9 / 9 7 for w / u of exertional chest pain . 
Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion . 
Subsequent cath 1 0 / 1 8 / 9 7 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion , RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis . 
Pt was transferred to BHCC on 1 0 / 1 9 for further evaluation by the cardiology service . 
On 1 0 / 2 1 he underwent echo which revealed EF 5 5 % with mild AS . 
On 1 0 / 2 2 , cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease . 
Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization . 
His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 1 0 / 2 3 . 
He now returns for surgical revascularization . 
Since his discharge on 1 0 / 2 3 , he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB .

He is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent MRA . 
In the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason . 
Subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro ' left brachial and Rt radial arterial route . 
His creatinine has risen from baseline of 1 . 6 ( Nov 9 7 , post CABG ) to 4 . 0 7 ( may 9 8 ) . 
He denies taking any NSAIDS . 
He thinks that he was started on Altace post surgery , but was not sure about that fact . 
Dr . Turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides . 
Since IR doctors at CentralBuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram / angioplasty thro ' radial artery route , Dr . Turk refered Mr . Ehlers to BHCC for consideration of renal angioplasty . 
He has also asked him to discontinue Altace and to withold coumadin ( Indn : AF ) inview of potential angioplasty . 
He complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg > Rt leg . 
He experiences pain on exertion on left calf , thigh and buttock . 
He complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level . 
He is SOB on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows . 
He also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream , frequency etc .

He notes mild occasional back pain . 
Bilateral distal femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses not palpable . 
Toes appear discolored and dusky in appearance with slight delay in capillary refill . 
PLAN : 1 . 
His MRA of abdomen was reviewed with Dr . Quilici , BHCC IR department . 
Aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys . 
Tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys . 
Both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the Rt renal artery . 
Both kidneys appeared normal in size 1 1 . 2 and 1 1 . 4 cm . 
Dr . Quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach . 
We have requested Dr . Xi , Vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future . 
If so , whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys . 
We are awaiting his expert opinion . 
Patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro ' radial artery carries its own risk . 
Risks of Cholesterol emboli , Contrast nephropathy , arterial injury , risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained . 
However patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty . 
We will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction . 
If patient is going for IR renal angiogram / plasty , then he will need Contrast prophylaxis . 
We will review him tomorrow with Dr . Xi ' s opinon . 
Patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in Cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes . 
He has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia , mod severe bilateral claudication in LL . 
His renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally . 
If he pushes further , he will also get right leg burning in a similar distribution . 
He also has had a marked increase in CR over the past 8 monts ( 1 . 1 - > > 4 ) . 
Based on non - invasive imaging , this has been attributed to renal artery stenosis . 
A referral was recently made to rule out bilateral RAS , and he had an invasive aortogram yesterday . 
There was an 8 5 % proximal right RA stenosis , and a 4 0 % left RA stenosis , perhaps only partially explaining the elevated Cr . 
The angiogram also confirmed the occluded distal aorta ( below the renal arteries , the SMA is patent ) . 
An aortobifem plus right RA revascularization is planned . 
He has had reduced functional capacity for some time . 
He gets claudication within 1 5 0 yards , but he also has been limited by exertional dyspnea . 
He complains also of orthopnea ( 3 pillows ) , PND , as well as bilateral LE edema . 
He also has noticed his weight continuing to creep up which he attributes to fluid retention . 
He is avoiding salt , but not fluid restricting . 
His lasix dose has not changed . 
He has been angina free since his CABG surgery . 
He has not had palpitations or AF since the immediate post - op period . 
A ROS is otherwise unremarkable . 
Family History : Noncontributory . 
Social History : Married , lives at home with his wife . 
Exsmoker . 
Minimal alcohol , no other substance abuse . 
Review of Systems : Noncontributary . 
Physical Examination : Mildly tachypnic RR 2 4 . 
BP 1 6 0 / 9 0 right arm . 
HR 6 0 reg . 
Afebrile . 
Head and neck examination unremarkable . 
No bruits heard . 
JVP markedly elevated at the angle of the jaw . 
The CP is delayed in upstroke , and mildly reduced in volume . 
There is S 1 S 2 and a II / VI SEM that is high pitched and peaks in mid to late systole . 
The Apex is hard to feel , but slight diffuse and sustained . 
The abdomen is obese , distended , nontender , and there is no organomegaly or masses . 
I would consider : increasing his diuretic ( eg . 
Lasix 8 0 mg iv bid ) to improve diuresis and get him euvolemic . 
Hopefully this will work ; if not , he should have ultrafiltration so that he is not in heart failure for his operation .

Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 4 0 6 MBq 9 9 mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day . 
Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made . 
STRESS TEST RESULTS : DURATION @ MAX DOSE ( min : sec ) 5 : 0 0 HR ( REST = > MAX ) 5 6 = > 7 4 ( 5 0 % PREDICTED ) BP ( INITIAL = > PEAK ) 1 5 0 / 6 0 = > 1 5 0 / 6 0 ( MINIMUM = 1 3 0 / x ) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT : 1 1 1 0 0 ENDPOINT ( S ) : The protocol was completed . 
Chest pain did not occur . 
REST ECG : The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T - wave abnormalities . 
Sinus bradycardia 5 6 / min . 
First degree AVB STRESS ECG : No ST segment changes were observed during this test . 
Arrhythmias : None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia . 
However , the sensitivity of Adenosine - induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited .

As an inpatient he developed a sacral decubitus ulcer which became large . 
During his rehab stay at LH , he was being followed by they HOB wound clinic for management of his sacral ulcer with a vac dressing . 
The wound progressed until he presented to the EW 8 / 9 6 with frank fecal contamination of a stage 4 ulcer .

While I know that you are familiar with his history , please allow me to briefly review it for my records . 
He is a lovely 5 3 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins , status post mantle radiation in the early 7 0 ' s ; coronary artery disease , status post - PCI to the LAD and RCA in ' 9 0 and ' 8 7 , respectively , and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer . 
MIBI done at LMC 1 / 2 4 / 9 4 showed normal EF without perfusion defects ( no scar or ischemia ) ; he exercised 1 0 : 3 0 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms . 
He was admitted 2 / 9 4 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer ( ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery ; he was not on plavix preop ) ; in PACU following resection , he had a VT / VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab , where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA . 
After extensive suction catheter use and POBA , a good angiographic result was obtained ; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in . 
Remarkably , echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function , with basal inferoposterior HK noted . 
His peak TnI was 3 3 . 6 , his peak CK was 1 7 1 0 , and his peak MB was 8 7 . 2 . 
He had a relatively unremarkable course post - catheterization ; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed , after which it was started without incident . 
He was discharged 2 / 1 1 / 9 4 , and returns today for routine follow - up . 
Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer , it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative ; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy , but will be closely followed . 
Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins , he is followed at RFPC , and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1 - 2 months . 
He has been walking outside for the past ~ 2 weeks ( since the weather improved ) , walking about 2 miles in around 3 0 minutes . 
He feels well , and has had no problems . 
He notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion ( climbing hills ) , but denies any unusual dyspnea . 
He denies chest pain , SOB at rest , orthopnea ( stable 2 pillow use ) , PND , edema , palpitaitons , or claudication . 
He brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his BP runs in the 1 0 0 - 1 2 0 ' s / 6 0 - 8 0 ' s , with rare systolics in the 1 3 0 ' s . 
His heart rate has been in the 7 0 - 8 0 ' s . 
His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension , but negative for CAD . 
He works in consulting , and travels around the Midwest as part of his job . 
He is now back at work . 
He is married , and lives in Lincoln City . 
He and his wife have 4 children , ages 1 5 / 1 7 / 2 0 / 2 4 ; they have no pets . 
He has never smoked cigarettes . 
He drinks 3 glasses of wine / week , and a cup of coffee qam . 
On physical exam today , he has a heart rate of 6 8 and a blood pressure of 1 3 4 / 7 5 . 
He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress . 
His JVP is flat sitting at 9 0 degrees , and he has no carotid bruits . 
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S 1 S 2 , and no murmurs , rubs , or gallups . 
His abdomen is benign . 
He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema , and with 2 + PT pulses bilaterally . 
His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 6 8 , with possible LAE , a nonspeciifc IVCD , and inferior Q waves in III / F , consistent with an inferior MI . 
He has increased voltages consistent with LVH . 
He is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint , and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life - threatening event . 
Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events . 
Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath , he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin . 
Furthermore , he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix . 
His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen , as demonstrated by his home records . 
I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 2 0 0 bid to toprol 2 0 0 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade , but otherwise , would not make any changes to his regimen at this time . 
We will check a full set of labs today , but I suspect that no further changes will be required at this time . 
Given his history of Hodgkin ' s , as well as his known CAD , he is clearly at risk for future events , and I suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia . 
Certainly , if he has any concerning symptoms , we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course . 
At present , however , I am delighted with how well he is doing . 
It was a pleasure to see Mr . Hall in cardiology clinic today . 
I will plan to see him in follow - up in 6 months time , but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns . 
The patient was seen by Dr . Ibarra . 
This is an addendum to the record . 
He stopped and felt better . 
No fevers , chills , or cough . 
Normocephalic and atraumatic . 
Heart is regular . 
Abdomen is soft and nontender . 
Extremities are nontender . 
Rectal exam is heme - negative . 
As I ' m sure you recall , he is a lovely 5 4 year old gentleman whose history of Hodgkins disease status - post mantle radiation in the early 7 0 ' s , squamous cell lung cancer status post left upper lobectomy 1 / 9 4 , and coronary artery disease , status post - PCI to the LAD and RCA in ' 9 0 and ' 8 7 , respectively , and perioperative VT / VF arrest at the time of his LUL resection 1 / 9 4 . 
At that time , emergent catheterization revealed massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA , managed with extensive suction catheter use and POBA , with a good angiographic result . 
No stents were placed given the thrombus burden . 
Remarkably , subsequent echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function , with basal inferoposterior HK noted . 
His peak TnI was 3 3 . 6 , his peak CK was 1 7 1 0 , and his peak MB was 8 7 . 2 . 
He had a relatively unremarkable course post - catheterization ; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed , after which it was started without incident . 
He was discharged 2 / 1 1 / 9 4 , and had done well until 1 / 3 1 / 2 0 9 5 , when he presented to WSH with unstable angina , having noted new sudden onset angina and dyspnea while making his daily walk . 
He had a positive troponin , and was taken urgently to cardiac catheterization , which revealed a proximal LAD lesion ( felt to be the culprit ) and ostial RCA lesion , both of which were stented with CYPHER stents . 
At that time the decision was made to increase his plavix from 7 5 to 1 5 0 as an attempt to maximize his medical management , given his history and disease burden . 
Since that admission , he has done exceedingly well , and presents today without complaints . 
He continues to walk 2 miles ~ 4 times / week without exertional symptoms . 
He specifically denies chest pain , dyspnea , orthopnea , PND , or lower extremity edema . 
He has had no palpitations , dizziness / presyncope , or claudication . 
He has significantly modified his diet to eliminate dairy and hydrogenated products / snacks , with a 5 # weight loss , and is motivated to further reduce his weight . 
He states that he feels " great " and isdoing quite well . 
He does not that occasionally at this work , when he is frustrated / upset , he will take his pressure and find his systolic to be ~ 1 5 0 , but this comes down within minutes if he relaxes , and his pressures are great at home . 
He has had no GI symptoms on the aggressive antiplatelet regimen , despite not being on a PPI . 
Regarding his squamous cell lung cancer , it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative ; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy , but will be closely followed . 
His most recent imaging was 1 1 / 9 4 , which was negative for evidence of metastasis by repor . 
Regarding his remote history of Hodgkins , he is followed at RFPC on an annual basis . 
His family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension , but negative for CAD . 
He works in consulting , and travels around the midwest as part of his job . 
He also works a few days a week at the local supermarket cashiering , and works as a museum docent a few times a week . 
He is married , and lives in Lincoln City . 
He and his wife have 4 children , ages 1 5 / 1 7 / 2 0 / 2 4 ; they have no pets . 
He has never smoked cigarettes . 
He drinks 1 glass of wine a night . 
On physical exam today , he has a heart rate of 7 5 and a blood pressure of 1 2 9 / 8 1 , with a weight of 2 2 0 # . 
He is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress . 
His JVP is ~ 7 - 8 cm ; he has no carotid bruits . 
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S 1 and a physiologically split S 2 , and no murmurs , rubs , or gallups . 
His abdomen is benign . 
He is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema , and with 2 + PT pulses bilaterally . 
His EKG in clinic today is NSR at 7 5 with possible left atrial abnormality , a nonspeciifc IVCD , and inferior Q waves in III / F , consistent with an inferior MI . 
In summary , this is a 5 4 year old man who had a VF arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior STEMI , status post extensive angiojet and POBA of acute in - stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his RCA , who represented 1 year later ( 1 / 9 5 ) with NSTEMI now s / p PCI to his RCA and LAD . 
Should he require future invasive diagnostic procedures , it would be reasonable to decrease doses to 7 5 plavix / 8 1 ASA , but we would not favor DC of either of these medications altogether . 
His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen , as demonstrated by his home records . 
His LDL is near goal , with a low HDL that was unaffected by high - dose niaspan in the past . 
I share his hope that with further diet / weight loss and exercise , these will both improve to goal . 
As I have discussed with he and his wife , given his history of Hodgkin ' s , as well as his known CAD , he is clearly at risk for future events , including the possibility of bypass surgery in the future . 
We will be guided by his symptoms , and he knows to call me if he has any problems / symptoms . 
It was a pleasure to see Mr . Hall in cardiology clinic today . 
I will plan to see him in follow - up in 6 months time , but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns . 
As you are well aware , he has many coronary risk factors . 
He is a 5 5 - year - old gentleman with past history Hodgkin ' s disease , status post mantle radiation in the early 2 0 7 0 s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2 0 9 4 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT / VF arrest . 
He has history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , as well as overweight . 
He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes , but on recent screening , his hemoglobin A 1 c has been elevated at 8 % . 
His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2 0 8 7 and 2 0 9 0 when he had non - ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA . 
He has subsequently had a VT / VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2 0 9 4 , which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results . 
He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis . 
In 0 1 / 2 0 9 5 , he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina , presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions , both which were intervened with drug - eluting Cypher stents with good results . 
Since then , he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 1 5 0 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 3 2 5 mg p . o . 
We see him in followup today , and again , he has no limitations in his exertional capacity . 
Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts , which is strenuous at times . 
He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job . 
He has no chest pain , shortness of breath , palpitations , presyncope , or syncope with exertion . 
He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure . 
He has been taking his blood pressures at home , which range at about 1 2 6 / 8 1 to 1 4 2 / 9 2 with an average of 1 3 5 / 8 5 . 
His heart rates have been in 5 0 s - 7 0 s . 
He has had no side effects to his medications . 
He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol . 
He says that he walks for 2 - 3 miles when the weather is nice , but given that it has been a harsh winter , he has not been doing this often . 
His current medications , aspirin 3 2 5 mg p . o . 
Physical Examination : Nick looked well . 
His weight was 2 3 2 pounds , his blood pressure was 1 5 3 / 8 9 in the right arm and 1 5 0 / 9 5 in the left arm with a large cuff , and his heart rate was 6 9 and regular . 
His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour . 
There are no bruits . 
His chest is clear to auscultation . 
He was not clubbed . 
His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S 1 and S 2 with no additional gallops , rubs , or murmurs . 
He had no peripheral edema . 
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly . 
His pulses were palpable 2 + throughout . 
Prior inferior Q - wave MI . 
TSH was also normal . 
Hemoglobin A 1 c was elevated at 6 . 8 % . 
Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 6 0 % - 6 5 % . 
Mild left atrial enlargement , no LVH . 
We started him on ramipril 2 . 5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks . 
He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week . 
To simplify and decrease his beta - blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 1 0 0 mg daily today . 
We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 5 0 0 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day . 
He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 3 2 5 about 3 0 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects . 
With regards to his coronary artery disease , all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child . 
Nevertheless , Dr . Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition , given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin . 
The results may not changes our current management strategy , but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology , particularly coronary artery thrombus , as well as play a future role in familial screening . 
To that end , we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition . 
We have also requested a thrombophilia workup , including factor V Leiden , prothrombin gene mutation , protein C and S levels , antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today . 
Otherwise , I believe Nick is doing well . 
We will see him again in 6 months ' time with follow up on these studies . 
If by then he still has evidence of diabetes , and trouble losing weight , we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital . 
He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity . 
This patient was discussed with Dr . Turner in clinic . 
As you know , Nick had mantle radiation in his youth for Hodgkin ' s lymphoma , and subsequently had 2 NSTEMIs in 2 0 8 7 and 2 0 9 0 . 
He received bare - metal stents to his LAD and RCA and did well until 2 0 9 4 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma , his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior STEMI / VT / VF arrest . 
Immediate angiography post - resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery , with good result after thrombectomy and POBA , in addition to Integrilin , aspirin , Plavix , and low dose heparin . 
Remarkably , after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event . 
He did well until 0 1 / 2 0 9 5 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in - stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare - metal stents . 
He was treated with Cypher drug - eluting stents to both lesions ( 3 . 5 x 1 8 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 2 0 atm to the LAD and 3 . 5 x 2 3 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA ) with no residual stenosis . 
Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in - stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy ( 3 2 5 mg ECASA and clopidogrel 1 5 0 mg ) since that event intended as longterm therapy . 
He has been followed by me since 2 0 9 5 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease , chest pain , and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function . 
Nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in IBM research in Leland . 
As the economy is picking up , his work environment has improved as has his stress level . 
He is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5 pounds . 
Every year he asks whether we can down - titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons ( I reassured him that it should be generic within a year ) . 
Nevertheless , we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the VerifyNow P 2 Y 1 2 PRU assay , and his result was 1 7 7 , which is below the cut - off of 2 3 0 PRU thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition . 
He recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine . 
His current medications should be aspirin 3 2 5 mg p . o . 
He has no known drug allergies . 
He is in no distress . 
Weight is 2 2 1 lbs . 
Blood pressure is 1 5 0 / 8 0 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 7 0 and regular . 
His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure , normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits . 
His chest is clear to auscultation . 
His cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops , rubs , or murmurs . 
He had no peripheral edema . 
His abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly . 
He had 2 + pulses in the peripheral exam . 
EKG today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 8 8 bpm with voltage criteria for LVH , LAE and prior inferior Q - waves . 
We are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 7 0 mg / dL . 
He has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache . 
His LDL last year was 9 8 mg / dL though HDL has improved to 3 7 mg / dL . 
His TC / HDL ratio is 4 . 2 , his TC is 1 5 5 mg / dL , and TG 1 0 1 mg / dL . 
HbA 1 c is 7 . 2 % . 
The previous echo in 2 0 9 6 demonstrated normal LV size and function with a normal LV ejection fraction of 6 0 % - 6 5 % with no signs of LVH . 
Should his LDL be & gt ; 7 0 mg / dL he should switch to rosuvastatin 4 0 mg daily for LDL and HDL improvement . 
Given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 2 3 0 PRU he will decrease to 7 5 mg daily and we will re - check his PRU activity after at least 7 days on this dose . 
Should PRU & gt ; 2 3 0 he will either need to restart 1 5 0 mg daily and take a PPI like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel ( or when available ticagrelor ) . 
He will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months . 
Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care . 
As I am not continuing a general out - patient clinic next year , Nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on Saturday . 
The patient was discussed in clinic with Dr . Neale Xiao who agreed with this plan . 
He in fact saw Dr . Atwood on 1 1 / 1 0 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left . 
However , one week ago he sat on the floor for ~ 3 hours doing electrical work , flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee , and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side . 
This lasted for ~ 2 4 hours . 
He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L , and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis . 
He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 1 2 / 1 0 , and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx . 
He then revisited Dr . Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L , possibly secondary to graft kinking and / or thrombosis , and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM . 
On ROS he has had no F / C / N / V / D / abd pain / back pain . 
Recommendations : OR in AM for angiogram and possible LLE thrombolysis . 
Unasyn IV for ? cellulitis Preop labs as above , U / A pending . 
EKG : 1 2 / 1 3 WNL , L axis deviation . 
CXR : 1 2 / 1 3 clear BL . 
Type and Screen : 1 2 / 1 3 BB sample received . 
NPO p MN , IVF p MN Pt consented for procedure , consent in chart . 
Mucomyst / bicarb protocol for renal protection prior to angio . 
Patient discussed with Dr . Vernon Barrera , vascular fellow . 
He presented to Dr . Atwood c / o new onset RLE pain , numbness , and color change , similar to previous episodes of graft thrombosis . 
He was evaluated at the time and a plan made for angiography and intervention . 
His INR was 2 . 9 , so it was allowed to drift down and he was scheduled for a procedure on 5 / 2 2 / 8 0 . 
He is admitted today for preoperative evaluation , anticoagulation , and renal protection . 
Mild erethema proximally . 
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease . 
Fellow : Vincent Gregory , M . D . 
Junior : Donovan J . Betty Barber , M . D . 
He noticed a lump approximately 3 weeks ago , underwent incision and drainage with wick placement and started a course of PO antibiotics . 
This has continued to drain serosanguinous fluid , apparently the overall induration and erythema with some additional fluid under moderate pressure was released . 
He has been seen daily by a visiting nurse and she can do the dressing , replacing the wick , and putting a sterile absorbent dressing on top of this . 
We will see him again in another week . 
He is on coumadin , last dose 3 . 5 last night . 
Denies fevers chills , SOB , cough .

PGY - 2 Vascular Surgery . 
M with h . o CAD and PVD s / p bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting procedures complicated by a thrombus in the L side of the iliac portion of the graft for which he has been on coumadin . 
In anticipation for a follow - up cardiac catheterization ( recent episodes of shortness of breath ) , his coumadin was held since Thursday ( 3 / 6 / 2 0 8 1 ) . 
Then on 3 / 7 / 2 0 8 1 , he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity . 
The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks . 
He complained of both numbness and pain , and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2 . 0 . 
Dr . Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH . 
He arrives today ( 3 / 8 / 2 0 8 1 ) on a heparin drip . 
ROS : As per HPI . 
M with HTN , PVD , HL , DM who presents several days after stopping coumadin for a planned cardiac catheterization with cold , pulseless LLE consistent with acute on chronic thrombosis of L femoral to below - the - knee bypass graft . 
On 0 3 / 0 9 / 2 0 8 1 , he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral - popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr . Godfrey . 
This was complicated by a postoperative MI . 
Of note , his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access . 
He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA , and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures . 
We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest . 
Allen & # 8 2 1 7 ; s test : prior to compression of radial artery , SpO 2 1 0 0 % . 
During compression , signal lost by probe within seconds . 
Upon release , signal regained , SpO 2 again 1 0 0 % . 
Remained 9 9 % with compression of radial artery X 2 minutes . 
His left radial artery may be safe to use for conduit . 
His right is not usable . 
She will not be available for radial artery harvest on Thursday of next week . 
Discussed with Dr . Queen Olivares , Plastic Surgery Fellow .

His blood pressure was 1 7 8 / 8 0 . 
The follow - up was 1 7 0 / 8 0 . 
Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation . 
White count is 8 . 3 . 
Digoxin is 0 . 9 . 
Assessment and Plan : 1 . 
Status post TURP . 
He appears to be recovering well . 
Thrombocytopenia . 
This was very relative . 
Coronary artery disease . 
Hypercholesterolemia . 
This has been well - controlled recently . 
Depression . 
He continues on Ambien . 
This lovely 7 7 - year old man has had past medical history notable for coronary artery disease , hypertension , benign prostatic hypertrophy , depression , insomnia , osteoarthritis status post total knee replacement . 
He presents today because of a recent exacerbation of symptomatic coronary artery disease . 
His history of coronary artery disease begins with his presentation following his total knee replacement in June of 2 0 9 1 . 
In 1 0 / 9 1 he had an episode of profound weakness and sat down . 
He had no clear substernal chest pressure , loss of consciousness or edema . 
Workup at that time included a thallium test which did not clearly demonstrate ischemia and an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 5 0 % . 
He began therapy at that point in time with aspirin , niacin , vitamin E , Lasix , Zestril , Zantac , Minipress , Amitriptyline , and Digoxin . 
He had been free of exertional neck , chest , arm and jaw pain , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , palpitations , claudication and TIA until this past spring . 
He actually had done very well with risk factor reduction including completing cardiac rehab at MJH and following a stringent weight reduction program and decreasing his weight . 
In March of 2 0 9 4 he began noticing that when he was going up the 1 9 steps in his house he began having mid - sternal chest discomfort and some dyspnea at the top of the stairs . 
He stopped working with the physiotherapist at that point and was initiated on nitrate therapy . 
Since that time he has noted that he has had significant decrease in symptoms and over the past week has actually had no need to take sublingual nitroglycerine and has been taking the full flight of stairs without difficulty . 
He does note fatigue and insomnia such that he is sleeping only 2 to 3 hours a night . 
He does continue to be free of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , palpitations or lightheadedness . 
Medical regimen includes Ambien , Paxil , Isordil 2 0 t . i . d . , Atenolol , Digoxin , Zantac and aspirin . 
He has no known drug allergies . 
On physical exam blood pressure when he first arrived at Clinic was noted to be 2 2 0 / 1 0 0 . 
There is no increase in jugular venous pressure . 
His carotids are free of bruits . 
His lungs are entirely clear to auscultation throughout , and cardiac exam is notable for a non - displaced PMI , S 1 and physiologically - split S 2 with no murmur , rub or gallop . 
Abdominal exam is notable for a ventral hernia . 
There is no organomegaly and neither are there bruits present . 
Lower extremities are notable for 2 + femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses with no edema . 
Skin exam is notable only for the senile angioma . 
Electrocardiogram is notable for a left bundle branch block which is new since prior tracing available here of 4 / 0 3 / 9 4 . 
MIBI was notable only for a potential fixed anteroseptal defect and no significant ischemia on 5 / 6 / 9 4 . 
The ejection fraction on a gated spect was 5 7 % . 
In summary , it appears that Mr . Vicente may have experienced a new myocardial infarction resulting in a left bundle branch block in March of 2 0 9 4 . 
He could , however , also have developed his progressive conduction system disease and have the fixed defect on his MIBI attributable only to a left bundle branch block . 
I will be reviewing the primary images to make my final decision . 
In either regard he is now free of symptoms on his current medical regimen despite his increased weight and his increased blood pressure . 
I certainly agree with further assistance from nutrition and weight loss and proceeding with Imdur therapy which I would increase to 6 0 mg p . o . 
I also would consider further decrease of his LDL with statin therapy but would only consider this after assessing his response to re - initiation his nutrition program . 
Given his lack of symptoms at the present time with his usual daily activity , I would prefer to proceed on the medical therapy route . 
I think that he could be reintroduced to rehab at MJH with the hopes that further education can get him back on line in terms of risk factor reduction . 
I certainly look forward to discussing this case further with you . 
It ' s certainly a pleasure to participate in his care . 
He felt he was wheezing . 
His blood pressure is 1 6 0 / 8 0 . 
Abdomen in soft and non - tender .

Then , the nurses put her in the hospital gown . 
Dr . Aponte was called . 
I will check labs today . 
She had an arrest in the field on 9 / 0 5 / 2 0 6 2 and was taken to SLH , after intubation in the field . 
Emergency catheterization showed 3 0 % LAD . 
CPKs were neg . 
Of note , a recent stress test at DCGH had shown LBBB but nl LV function , so she was diagnosed with new cardiomyopathy . 
She was disch on 9 / 1 0 to Dr . Qu ' s care . 
It is not clear that she has followed - up recently , though a echo from 0 9 / 2 4 / 6 2 shows an ejection fraction of 5 8 % with no definite segmental wall motion abnormality . 
She has been pain free and is able to walk a few blocks without difficulty since then . 
Remains on Paxil and also takes Ativan nightly . 
All other parameters nl .

She vomits rarely . 
She is slightly constipated . 
She is moderately dyspneic on exertion . 
Abdomen is soft and nontender . 
There is no renal tenderness . 
Extremities have no edema . 
This might succeed in reducing some of her nausea . 
Xander Xie , M . D . 
This is a very small amount for diabetic nephropathy , and argues in favor of vascular disease . 
I would suggest getting a MRA of renal arteries to look for any main artery obstruction . 
If present it would account for the sensitivity of her creatinine to ACE or changes in hydration . 
The cause of the RI is unclear but probably related to either diabetic or hypertensive disease . 
We had a very blunt discussion about dialysis and her desire to not go on it . 
She understands that she would die from progressive renal dysfunction and she will talk more about this with Drs Yeomans and Xie . 
The patient presents to the office for follow - up of ( # 2 ) anemia .

THE ORGINAL IS STORED ON THE COMPENDIA SERVER AT SMI KESSEL GROUP HOME AND IN PRINT IN THE PATIENT ' S SMI PAPER RECORD . 
Mr . Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak . 
He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength . 
He states he really didn ' t have any symptoms other than weakness , but when asked about chest pain , he notes that he had mild chest discomfort , which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise . 
He also describes some mild lightheadedness . 
He has 2 pillow orthopnea , but he denies any fever , chills , nausea , night sweats , unintentional weight loss , syncope , HA , dyspnea , chest pain , PND , diaphoresis , palpitations , or any other concerning symptoms . 
He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry , bright red , pencil thin , or watery . 
He denies any abdominal pain , constipation , or diarrhea . 
He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms , while exertion worsened his symptoms . 
He has had these symptoms before in March of this year , but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then . 
At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing , and he was found to have a Hct of 2 4 . 9 . 
He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy , where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps . 
The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy . 
He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI . 
Dr . David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia ( Hct 2 5 . 4 MCV 7 5 ) , dizziness , and orthostasis . 
Polyps - Single polyp 1 0 / 8 7 removed by colonoscopy ( tubulovillous adenoma ) with 1 1 day postpolypectomy bleed . 
F / U colonscopy in 1 1 / 1 0 / 9 0 and 1 2 / 1 5 / 9 0 found 2 5 mm polyp in ascending colon that could not be completely removed ( Tubulovillous adenoma by pathology ) . 
He is a Performer at GEICO . 
Father died at age 8 1 of aspiration pneumonia and had Alzheimer ' s disease . 
Mother died at age 8 0 of uncertain cause . 
No head or neck lesions or masses . 
No lower extremity swelling . 
OP w / moist mucus membranes , no erythema , thrush , or injection . 
JVP ~ 6 . 
No M / R / G . 
Guaic positive per ER . 
No erythema , effusions , or induration . 
Mental status normal ( Intact verbal language and comprehension ) , CN II through XII intact , no nystagmus , Motor 5 / 5 in handgrip , biceps , quads , gastrocnemius , ant . 
No deficits to touch bilaterally throughout . 
DTR 2 + / 2 + in patella , achiles , biceps , and brachioradialis . 
Toes going down bilaterally . 
Axis at 0 . 
His Hct stabilized at 2 6 since his transfer from his PCP ' s office . 
His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER . 
He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically . 
Given that he hasn ' t had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year , he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr . Narvaez . 
Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response , but his DTR were normal . 
Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia . 
He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary . 
His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted . 
He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension . 
Given his chest pain and syncope , MI will be ruled out , but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation . 
His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes . 
Pt . 
He also reports a 1 - 2 week h / o increasing DOE when he performs his household chores or working in his backyard . 
The patient acutely developed SOB after lying down for a few minutes during his CT . 
He felt 1 / 1 0 CP during this episode located in the R middle sub - sternum . 
The pain lasted for approximately 1 0 min , dull in quality , did not radiate , did not change with position , relieved after given NTG in the ED . 
He experienced a similar CP during an administration of his chemo several months PTA . 
This CP was determined not be be cardiogenic . 
He reports eating a lot of salty foods . 
Also noted anorexia , fatigue , bloody stools .

Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration . 
However , the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV - associated renal disease a worthy consideration . 
Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia . 
I took the liberty to order a 2 4 - hour urine collection , a kidney US , as well as SPEP , UPEP , cryoglobulin level , Fe - studies .

She is followed up by Dr . Horne who felt that she had a lot of anxiety and she was at that time on lisinopril as well as her other diabetic medications . 
She comes back from Maine . 
She is on the following medications : 1 .

She states today that her abdomen has been distended for the past 5 days . 
She has not had a bowel movement in 1 0 days . 
She ordinarily has a bowel movement once every 2 weeks . 
She takes nothing to move her bowels and she is extraordinarily upset about her daughter who is homeless . 
She has provided for her daughter , helped her get a job , and the daughter is emotionally ill , and I have advised the patient that she should be in a mental institution . 
The patient no longer care for her daughter and her daughter cares nothing about her father and mother . 
It is a hopeless situation and 4 5 minutes were spent in discussion of the daughter ' s illness and what the patient would do about this . 
I have told her to use some Dulcolax suppositories and Dulcolax by mouth for probable impacted feces , although this is not an uncommon thing for her and I have ordered a set of blood tests to check on her diabetes , kidney function , etc . 
She has a good physician in Maine where she is planning to move in June and she will return to me next week for a complete physical . 
She does have diabetic neuropathy mild and diabetic nephropathy mild . 
Her back has healed . 
She no longer uses a cane to walk except on climbing stairs . 
She no longer has any chest pain or shortness of breath . 
She is extraordinarily anxious and hopefully she will listen to the advice that I gave her . 
Total time spent during this visit was 4 5 minutes . 
I last saw her on 0 7 / 2 7 / 2 1 1 2 . 
She is a 7 2 - year - old woman who is status post a right MCA distribution cortical infarct in April of 2 1 1 2 with residual left hand weakness . 
Since I last saw her Mrs . Lindsay has not done very well . 
She has had multiple recent falls and her gait has become even more unsteady . 
She tends to veer to either side and does have a frequent feeling of lightheadedness . 
She has hit her head on a couple of occasions with these falls . 
Of note her blood pressure medication has been essentially doubled since I last saw her . 
She is now taking 1 0 mg of Zestril every day instead of five and taking Atenolol 5 0 mg q . d . 
She does have intermittent weakness of the left hand which is likely recrudescent of her prior stroke symptoms and not new strokes . 
She does not have discoordination , vertigo or diplopia . 
She does have intermittent chest pains as well which she loath to bring to the attention of her physician . 
She is reluctant to use a cane because her family states that " her husband does not use a cane and he is older , why should she have to use a cane " . 
She has been switched to Plavix 7 5 mg p . o . 
This was done without my knowledge as well . 
She continues to have difficulty " feeling my feet " and this has been a chronic problem for her as well . 
On examination she is alert . 
She is a garrulous and tangential historian and needs to be frequently refocussed . 
Her speech is fluent in English . 
English is her second language and she is less fluent in that language . 
Her visual fields are full to confrontation . 
Her extraocular movements are full with no nystagmus . 
Her face is symmetric other than a mild left nasolabial fold flattening . 
She has a mild left pronator drift and slowed finger tapping on the left side . 
She has no ataxia on finger - to - nose - to - finger testing . 
Her gait is slightly wide - based and unsteady . 
She can veer to either side and frequently has to hold on to someone next to her for stability . 
IMPRESSION : I do not feel that Mrs . Lindsay has had a new embolic event , however I am quite concerned about her continued falling and difficulty with both her continued peripheral neuropathy and likely hypoperfusion . 
This appears to be pressure dependent and I would suggest that we back off on her antihypertensive medications at this time . 
In looking at her recent CBCs she has also been consistently anemic and with her complaints of chronic fatigue I think this could certainly be a factor . 
Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether . 
Furthermore with her recurrent chest pains she should seek an opinion from her primary care physician regarding this and I have counseled her to do so . 
I will see Mrs . Lindsay in follow up in 6 months time but I am available to discuss her care at any time in the interim . 
She has a baseline amount of increasing forgetfulness , decreased appetite , and increased somnolence over the past 2 years . 
She frequently forgets whether or not she has taken her medications . 
She rarely leaves her home as her walking is limited by joint pain and shortness of breath . 
She moves around the house infrequently and when she does it is usually from the bed to the couch per her daughter . 
She has had several falls in the recent years . 
She does not cook and is overall much less active than her husband who lives with her . 
At her baseline , her family is concerned that she has been developing Alzheimer ' s Disease . 
Twelve days ago , she underwent cataract surgery on her R eye and was in her usual state of health for several days thereafter . 
However , two days ago , she started to hallucinate mentioning she was seeing flies , birds and spots . 
Her family noted that she had difficulty forming words and also spoke incoherently at times . 
She also complained of dizziness , had an increasingly unsteady gait , and did not want to eat both expressing no interest in food and saying she was worried about not being able to swallow . 
She has also been falling asleep very rapidly recently , so much so that she has fallen asleep on her plate at the breakfast table . 
However , she has also woken up frequently at night , often talking incoherently and once even getting up and attempting to cook breakfast at 3 am . 
Her family also mentions that her face had recently become swollen . 
Her family reports that her symptoms were worsened after she took her Diamox , and thus they stopped giving it to her . 
She was brought to the ED on 1 0 / 0 6 / 1 5 as her family was concerned that she had another CVA . 
Her VS on admission were BP 1 2 0 / 4 1 , HR 5 4 , RR 1 8 , T 9 6 . 4 , O 2 sat 9 6 % on RA . 
She had a negative CT , MRI , CXR and labs were drawn . 
In the ED she reportedly had an episode of choking while eating a pancake . 
Currently , she reports that she is seeing many small black dots , is tired and has no dizziness , HA or pain . 
She also reports occasional transient stabbing pain in the center of her sternum that often accompanies intense emotions and is not made worse by activity . 
She has occasional palpitations .

This could have had the effect of decreasing her intravascular volume , thus leading to a prerenal state and her increased uremia , and decreased renal clearance of her renally cleared medications , thus leading to acute delirium on chronic dementia . 
Common causes of delirium include FEN disturbances , infections , drug toxicity , metabolic disorders , low perfusion states , withdrawal from alcohol or sedatives , and idiopathic . 
In addition , there is the possibility of CVA , however the MRI and CT were negative and the time course and symptoms are not consistent with a CVA . 
Of concern though is that she has somewhat atypical signs of delirium such as dysarthria and ataxia . 
Metabolic causes of delirium commonly include Na , Ca , Mg , B 1 2 , NH 3 imbalances . 
Her Na , Mg and Ca are wnl . 
Her BUN is elevated at 7 7 , which is close to twice her baseline , and in the setting of a fragile patient , this could be enough to tip her over to delirium . 
Her glucose was 2 1 5 on admission , which is elevated , but only mildly so for a diabetic and not at high enough levels for MS changes to occur . 
Infection is possible as her WBC is slightly elevated at 1 2 . 1 with 7 8 % poly ' s . 
However , there is no obvious source of infection and she has a normal CXR and U / A , likely ruling out a PNA and UTI respectively . 
She has no signs of infection at the site of her eye surgery . 
She could have a bacteremia secondary to other infection or due to her procedure , but without a fever , this is highly unlikely . 
Her mental status change could be drug induced , as she is on multiple medications with the recent addition of Prednisolone and Vigamox eye drops as well as Diamox that was recently stopped by the family . 
Eye drops generally do not get particularly high systemic absorption , although there is an anatomic proximity to the CNS . 
However , cardiovascular drugs , antidepressants , and corticosteroids are all known to induce delirium and she is on all of them , including two SSRI ' s . 
The new Diamox could be enough to tip her over as it is a diuretic and by itself it can cause confusion , and by inducing more diuresis , it can cause a prerenal state , thus decreasing renal clearance of her other drugs and increasing their levels , thus leading to delirium . 
Indeed , her baseline Creatinine is from 1 . 6 - 1 . 9 and was 2 . 4 on admission to the ED and her baseline BUN is from 2 0 - 4 0 while it was 8 2 on admission to the ED . 
There is no present concern for drug toxicity and her tox screen was negative . 
She had a recent stress test that was negative . 
However , it is possible that she has some orthostasis , which would fit with her recent history of falls at home . 
However , this would not cause the delirium . 
Her dementia has been developing over a few years and the possible etiologies include Alzheimer ' s , vascular dementia , pseudodementia , thyroid abnormalities , B 1 2 and / or Folate deficiency , tertiary syphilis and chronic infarct dementia . 
Chronic infarct dementia is a distinct possibility with MRI of brain showing chronic infarcts in the right posterior frontal and left parietal regions . 
Her stasis , DM and high homocysteine levels ( 1 8 . 8 in 2 1 1 3 ) are risk factors with PFO for multi - infarct dementia . 
TSH , B 1 2 , Folate , RPR , ESR .

In brief , 7 4 F with dementia presenting with acute on chronic renal failure and delerium . 
Etiology likely multifactorial , however , diamox is the only new medication and may explain both her worsening renal failure and delirium . 
Will pursue broad differential as outlined above . 
During her R . MCA CVA she had L . facial droop , RUE weakness and numbness , but today the sx are only limited to the face as noted above . 
She denied CP , SOB , palpitations , no diplopia , language , motor , other sensory , visual , or gait deficits , no n , v , vertigo . 
She has intermittently sharp h / a bifrontally , but not persistent . 
She does suffer from similar h / a routinely . 
No fevers , but has had chills , and sweats since yesterday . 
Her PCP Dr . Urquidez came to see her while she was in the ED and noted that though her BP is elevated , lately she has ranged between 1 6 0 - 2 0 0 mm Hg SBP despite meds .

By report , patient was sitting on the couch at his sister ' s house , slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 4 5 seconds that was witnessed by EMS sevices . 
Accu - checks done at that time were > 5 0 0 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful . 
He was transported to ER , where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful , by 2 physicians . 
There appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway ( not obvious on CT scan ) . 
However , pt had witnessed emesis , and was placed on 1 0 0 % nonrebreather mask , with Versed and propofol for sedation with adequate O 2 saturation .

Prophylaxis - nexium , heparin SQ , peridex , HOB 3 0 . 
At the time , blood sugar was > 5 0 0 . 
Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland , he has BP 2 4 8 / 1 4 6 ; plt count was in 8 0 0 ' s . 
At BMH , MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA - echo was done showing no vegetations , no PFO , NL EF with LVH ; TEE without vegetations as well . 
LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative . 
Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS . 
Other parts of the secondary htn workup were done including evaluation for hyper aldo , pheo . 
The vent was weaned and he was extubated on the 4 th . 
HTN was controlled with labetolol drip with additional oral agents being added . 
He continued to have intermittent fevers and was on broad antibiotics which were originally weaned off . 
Hematologically , the hct and wbc fell as he was hydrated . 
Plt count stayed stable in the 6 0 0 ' s for several days before increasing on the 3 rd gradually up to the 1 0 0 0 ' s . 
Retics were depressed at presentation and iron studies were c / w ACD and he was started on epogen . 
Initially it was felt that his thrombocytosis was most certainly reactive ; CRP was > 1 5 0 with ESR > 1 0 0 . 
He left the ICU and at this point his WBC trended down and he was afebrile and more clinically stable . 
But his platelets kept climbing to nearly 1 . 5 million . 
A bone marrow biopsy was done showing no cytogenetics to suggest CML and there were elevated megakaryocytes read as concerning for a myeloproliferative process . 
As well , he suffered a DVT in his subclavian / IJ on the same side as a central venous catheter . 
Given his thrombocytosis and elevated plt count , he was platelet pheresed twice in the hospital . 
As well , hydrea was started at this time , initially at 5 0 0 mg bid and then escalated to 1 0 0 0 mg bid when his counts were up to 8 0 0 - 9 0 0 despite the medication . 
As well , he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer . 
For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA . 
He was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago and has done fairly well since then . 
His energy has been good . 
He denies any fevers / chills / sweats . 
No bleeding / bruising . 
No further swelling in his arms / legs . 
He does have some occasionally blurryness in eyes immediately after taking his anti - hypertensives but no numnbess / weakness / dizziness . 
He was treated for concern of essential thrombocytosis in hospital with platelet pheresis then hydrea . 
Today , he presents looking well and still has a thrombocytosis despite the hydrea . 
It is still not possible to tell for sure if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs Essential thrombocytosis . 
At the moment , we will continue to treat this as ET and will continue hydrea at the current dose and ask him to take aspirin 8 1 mg qd . 
If this is a reactive process , time should be a good diagnostic test at this should improve after he is further from his complicated hospital / icu stay . 
At his next visit with us next month we will recheck his C - reactive protein , ESR , iron studies / ferritin for some idea of whether his body could still be mounting an inflammatory response to drive a reactive thrombocytosis . 
If his plt count comes down , we will be able to start tapering his hydrea at that time . 
Of note , in the near future , we may be able to help determine between reactive and essential process with measurement of the JAK 2 kinase level . 
In the meantime , he will be meeting with his new PCP and renal physician next week . 
At the time , blood sugar was > 5 0 0 . 
Upon initial arrival to the ER in Maryland , he has BP 2 4 8 / 1 4 6 ; plt count was in 8 0 0 ' s . 
At BMH , brain MRI showed several small areas of infarct read as concerning for embolic CVA . 
Embolic work - up included an echo which showed no vegetations , no PFO , NL EF with LVH ; TEE without vegetations as well . 
LP was done and sent for HSV which was negative . 
He underwent a renal workup which showed nephrotic range proteinuria with labs also notable for rhabdoymyolysis . 
Renal doppler US showed no sign of RAS . 
Other parts of the secondary hypertensive work - up were done including evaluation for hyperaldosteronism and pheochromocytoma .

As well , he suffered a small GI bleed due to an ulcer . 
For this reason he was not anticoagulated but placed upon daily ASA . 
He was discharged from the hospital in September . 
Since then he has been followed in hematology clinic . 
Initially , his platelets were still in the hi 5 0 0 ' s despite hydrea at 1 0 0 0 bid . 
His hematocrit was mildly depressed at this point as well ( 2 9 - 3 1 % ) . 
He was re - evaluated on 1 2 / 0 5 / 6 1 . 
His platelets were 5 0 2 , 0 0 0 . 
An epo level was drawn and his hydrea was increased to 1 5 0 0 / 1 0 0 0 mg . 
He was re - evaluated on 1 2 / 2 6 / 6 1 and found to have a hematocrit of 2 6 . 2 % , WBC of 2 . 7 K , and platelets of 5 0 8 , 0 0 0 . 
His hydrea was decreased to 5 0 0 mg bid . 
Interval History : Since his last visit , he left for Wynne for one month . 
When he returned , his creatinine had increased to 4 . 0 . 
A renal biopsy performed last week showed diabetic nephropathy . 
He is being evaluated by Dr . Xing for dialysis and renal transplant evaluation . 
In terms of his blood disorders , the patient has been at his baseline fatigue , slightly improving over the past few months . 
He has no fevers , chills , night sweats , or unexplained weight loss . 
He had one episode of transient global blurry vision 3 weeks ago which resolved on its own and has not recurred . 
He has no headaches , other sensory deficits , or focal neurologic symptoms . 
He has no oral ulcers or skin lesions from his Hydrea . 
Father has severe HTN as well as renal disease , though not on dialysis .

No cough , sputum production , sore throat . 
No epistaxis , gingival bleeding . 
No nausea , vomiting , anorexia , diarrhea , constipation . 
No hematochezia , melena . 
No hematuria or other urinary symptoms . 
All other ROS are negative in detail . 
Assessment and Plan : Mr . Goins is a 2 7 yo male with insulin dependent diabetes and apparent untreated HTN who presented with seizure in setting of hypertensive emergency , subsequently found to have nephrotic syndrome , renal insufficiency , and several small embolic - appearing strokes . 
In this setting , he has developed marked thrombocytosis to 1 . 5 million and had subsequent provoked DVT . 
He was treated with platelet pheresis , then hydrea . 
It has been unclear if this is still a reactive thrombocytosis vs essential thrombocytosis . 
We are following his CBC on hydrea . 
His platelets are moderately elevated ( 7 5 7 K ) . 
He has no evidence of recurrent thrombosis . 
His current hydrea dosing cannot be increased due to his anemia . 
We would advise starting erythropoetin , monitoring his blood pressure closely . 
At his current platelet count , his risk of thrombosis is not greatly increased , especially as his platelets are dysfunctional due to uremia . 
We would advise continuing current hydrea . 
Continue current hydrea Monitor counts monthly Agree with starting erythropoetin in Internal Medicine . 
The patient states that since I last saw him , he is being evaluated further for renal transplant . 
In addition , attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out . 
Given that this one did not work out , a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it . 
Most recently , the patient ' s creatinine was 6 . 4 and his BUN was 4 6 two weeks ago . 
The patient ' s diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin . 
Most recently , his hemoglobin A 1 c was 6 . 6 on 0 2 / 2 7 / 2 0 6 2 . 
The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 7 0 and 1 1 0 . 
Currently , he is on labetalol 6 0 0 mg PO BID , furosemide 2 0 mg PO QD , clonidine 0 . 3 mg PO QHS , lisinopril 4 0 mg PO QD , and nifedipine XL 9 0 mg PO QHS . 
BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen . 
For this reason , the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently . 
He has recently been started on erythropoietin , which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week . 
Most recently , his hematocrit was 2 9 . 4 % two weeks ago . 
Most recently , his lipids were done on 0 2 / 2 7 / 2 0 6 2 and at that time his total cholesterol was 2 9 4 and his LDL was 2 0 9 . 
This is a new problem for the patient , given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago . 
Given this , the patient was started on Lipitor 2 0 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia . 
We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks . 
He was reportedly in good health the night prior to admission and the morning of admission per his family , with no sick contacts and no travel . 
At HD he was hypertensive with SBP in 2 0 0 s , had transient L arm weakness and paresthesias which then resolved and had difficulty speaking and following commands after being noted by his nephrologist at an OSH to be mentating well with normal speech . 
No urinary / bowel incontinence , tonic - clonic movements or syncope was noted by his providers . 
He was brought to BMH ED because of these problems . 
In the ED , his initial VS were BP 2 1 1 / 1 2 0 HR 8 8 T 9 8 R 1 8 SaO 2 1 0 0 % RA . 
He received 5 mg hydralazine iv x 2 and was started first in a TNG gtt and then on a nitroprusside gtt to 1 0 0 / min titrated to a goal of MAP 1 2 0 . 
Had high ferritin , low TIBC and high ESR levels when checked in the past .

His BP has remained high , so will attempt to reduce by 2 5 % MAP for a few hours and then start an oral agent . 
Nitroprusside will be used first but if he needs an extended treatment , will change to nicardipine ( Bj Q Sugudoyta 1 1 6 5 Glb ; 7 ( 9 Kk 1 ) : 4 1 4 - 8 ) given his ESRD . 
His change in mental status is likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy , but it is hard to exclude other sources of end - organ involvement such as the heart ( especially considering his thrombocytosis ) given his ongoing confusion . 
Other sources of his confusion might include meningitis given his leukocytosis . 
Has an S 3 , but no signs of L or R heart failure . 
No EKG changes consistent with ischemia , will cycle cardiac biomarkers x 3 , give ASA , Lipitor . 
Will reduce afterload with Nitroprusside , IVFs , po anti - hypertensives . 
His mental status and leukocytosis are likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy but potentially concerning for possible meningitis . 
Will perform lumbar puncture , hold Abx since he has been in the hospital for more than 6 h , give if CSF studies indicate it . 
Will reduce MAP by 2 5 % to ~ 1 0 0 , will start with Nitroprusside , switch to Nicardipine . 
Will re - start some oral agents once reduced .

Of note , was also a very high HDL . 
The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication . 
We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point . 
Severe hypertension . 
Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled . 
Hyperparathyroidism . 
We will check a PTH level today . 
He ' s been trying - cut way back on sodas , and chips . 
He walks every day - really no complaints . 
His HbA 1 C was up at 9 . 2 . 
No proteinuria . 
No complaints of foot numbness , no visual sx . 
Lipids were fair - 2 0 2 , HDL 4 4 , Trigs 4 6 1 . 
Habits : no smoking or drinking . 
Eventually we ' ll need to teach Mills / family how to do fingersticks , but we aren ' t there yet . 
He will need eye exam . 
Adding statin and Aspirin today . 
Hypertension - add HCTZ 2 5 mg qd . 
Has sharp pain , starts in thumb , radiates proximally up arm to biceps area . 
Pain lasts several minutes , resolves spontaneously . 
Occurs several times a day , not reated to arm movement . 
He denies trauma to area , recent falls , denies swelling , redness , rashes , weakness . 
I recommended pt f / u w / Dr . Kidd in next few weeks ( no showed 1 2 / 7 4 appt , next appt 1 0 / 7 5 ) . 
Sister Urquiza will call for appt . 
RTC if pain persists . 
In brief the patient is a 6 2 yo man with mental retardation , HTN , hyperlipidemia , head trauma with SDH with evacuation , DM who presents with gait instability and difficulty with speaking and swallowing . 
Per guardian the patient was in his USOH until 9 / 2 4 / 7 5 evening at approximately 8 : 3 0 pm he was found to have mumbled speech and having difficulty with ambulation with leaning to the left . 
On 9 / 2 5 / 7 5 in the morning he had a fall when getting out of bed and struck his head , and brought to the ED . 
No prior history of stroke or TIA . 
Comprehends simple commands . 
EOMI but with nystagmus in all directions of gaze , even primary gaze . 
Facial sensation intact . 
Face asymmetric . 
Tongue , palate symmetric . 
SCM and traps 5 / 5 . 
Plantar response is flexor on right and extensor on left . 
IMPRESSION : The patient has numerous risk factors for stroke with HTN , DM 2 , and HLP . 
His exam is consistent with lateral medullary pyramid lesion with involvement of spinalcortical tract prior to decussation explaining ipsilateral weakness and also involvement of the spinalthalamic tract explaining contralateral deficit in pain sensation . 
His vessel imaging is notable and concerning for diffuse atherosclerotic disease , specifically in posterior circulation in distribution of acute stroke . 
The patient was reportedly taking aspirin , though reports are mixed and this needs clarification . 
Vessel imaging did not implicate that the patient suffered from acute vertebro - basilar thrombo - embolism , but that his posterior circulation disease is a chronic issue and the stroke was more likely due to distal vessel thrombosis . 
Anticoagulation can be considered in acute setting of small sized posterior circulation stroke with vertebro - basilar disease , but in this case by the time the patient became known to neurology service and by the time it was known he had a stroke it was some 2 4 hrs after initial symptoms , and in this interval he did not show any signs or symptoms of stroke progression making unstable plaque unlikely . 
Given the findings of the WASID study that anticoagulation did not significantly improve recurrent stroke prevention benefits over aspirin for symptomatic vertebro - basilar disease ( because warfarin benefits were offset by higher hemorrhage rates ) , the decision to place this patient on aspirin is supported . 
The long term management of this patient requires aggressive control of atherosclerotic risk factors such as HTN , DM 2 , and HLP . 
The patient is significantly at risk of major ischemic stroke due to occluded right carotid artery and diffuse posterior circulation disease , and it is conceivable that if he continues to have persistent symptoms in the future that a revascularization procedure may be necessary . 
He has been cared at home by his sister since his stroke last year and per his PCP & # 8 2 1 7 ; s notes earlier this year and per ED report his behavior and management has become steadily more difficult for his sister at home . 
Pt & # 8 2 1 7 ; s sister not with him on the floor however , per ED report pt supposedly found eating his own feces earlier and his sister expressing frustration and requesting a rehab placement for patient . 
Currently patient is alert an oriented x 3 and while denying any issues or complaints does express understanding that he is admitted with goal of being placed at a NH or rehab place . 
He denies any CP , SOB , n / v , f / c , HA , change in vision , worsening numbness , tingling , or parasthesia . 
He does report decrease right - sided strength on his right side but reports improvement in strength since the CVA last year especially in the lower extremities . 
In ED CT of the head was performed and pt admitted for further w / u and possible placement . 
Patient oriented to place and time and to person ( president ) with little help . 
About 4 / 5 strength on the LUE , LLE , RLE . 
No acute intracranial hemorrhage . 
Stable mild opacification of the right mastoid air cells . 
Impression / Plan : 6 3 - year - old man with mental retardation , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and s / p CVA in 2 0 7 5 who has been taken care of by his sister . 
Steadily with worsening behavioral issues and more difficult to take care of by his sister . 
Head CT is negative for a new CVA and labs are grossly normal and not suggestive of any major metabolic imbalance . 
Patient also appears stable and NAD and fairly alert and oriented to the situation . 
He will likely benefit from a nursing home or rehab placement . 
The patient was interviewed and examined by me . 
Specifically , abdomen was soft and nontender . 
EKG is unremarkable . 
Chest x - ray is negative . 
The patient will be admitted to oncology hematology for workup . 
He was treated with CHOP in 2 0 6 6 followed by radiotherapy , completed in Nov 2 0 6 6 . 
He was free of disease since then until May 2 0 7 3 . 
He sought primary care for a URI and was noted to be anemic ( HCT 3 1 ) . 
His counts were followed and when his HCT dropped as low as 2 2 a Bone Marrow was done and showed myelodysplastic syndrome . 
He was considered for a allogenic stem - cell transplant . 
His major complaint is a dry cough that he has had since May 2 0 7 3 . 
It is provoked by eating , drinking and lying down . 
And only occasionally does he produce any sputum . 
He has been on numerous antibiotics in the past four months for the cough and he also developed a periorbital cellulitis for which he was hospitalized at Educare - Fargo for which he received a 3 week course of Ceftriaxone , Nafcillin and flagyl ( finished at the end of July ) . 
In retrospect , he recognizes sinus pressure / congestion associated with periorbital cellulitis . 
In August 2 0 7 3 he had a questionable LLL PNA and was treated with cipro . 
CT chest reviewed today revealed mutlifocal pneumonia with associated radiation - related changes . 
Throughout this time period he has only had a few days of fever for which he was at KCGH and given abx and defervesced . 
He does admit to maybe a 1 0 lb weight loss in the past 4 months . 
He does have mild peripheral neuropathy in his feet bilaterally . 
NO occupational exposures . 
He is married with three children and 4 grandchildren . 
He does not smoke or drink . 
He has remote travel hx to the Rockefeller Centre , more recent global travel ( Fernley , Cartersville , Iceland ) , and frequent travel to Muscat area . 
He recently gave his indoor cat away as he hypothesized that she had something to do with his cough / MDS . 
He does not recall tick bites and has infrequently visited Storting and Capitol . 
Father died of diabetes , Mother died at age 9 0 . 
Paramediastinal opacification is changed . 
Cardiomediastinal silhoutte is stable . 
No new consolidations are seen . 
There is a new left - sided Hickman catheter with its tip in the SVC . 
No pneumothorax is seen . 
Impression : 6 6 yo M with h / o IDDM , large cell lymphoma in 2 0 6 6 , and now with myelodysplastic syndrome who presents with fourth months of cough of unclear etiology . 
The differential diagnosis is broad and includes both infectious and non - infectious diagnoses . 
Our leading diagnosis is either radiation fibrosis or a primary interstitial lung disease , such as COP . 
However , we also think that several infectious etiologies should be considered . 
Endemic mycoses ( histo , blasto and crypto ) , cryptococcal pneumonia , nocardiasis , aspergillus , mucormycosis and MAC are some diseases to consider in this patient . 
While the clinical picture of granulomas on chest CT and cough is consistent with the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease , the patient is very low risk for this infection and his lack of fevers , progressive weight loss and systemic illness argues against this diagnosis . 
I ( AYX ) have interviewed and examined Mr . Ware , and confirmed all of the findings documented in this note . 
My highest suspicion is for an inflammatory process , such as radiation pneumonitis or BOOP / COP . 
An occult infection is quite possible , such as pulmonary MAC or a mold ( the lesion in his left lower lobe is especially suspicious ) . 
Clinically he is unchanged over many months , so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated . 
It is reasonable to start is levaquin 5 0 0 mg QD now to treat empirically for typical and atypical pathogens ( this medication is scheduled to begin in two days , per protocol ) . 
Thank you for this consult . 
Normal S 1 and S 2 . 
No murmurs . 
No calf tenderness . 
The patient was given IV and p . o . 
His post - tx course was unremarkable . 
Peritransplant he devloped a multifocal PNA of unclear etiology . 
Pretransplant imaging showed peribronchial thickening , and post transplant a tree & amp ; bud appearance with more focal areas of consolidation . 
Per the patient , he had a dry hacking cough with occaisional fevers and night sweats that lasted from April through November of 7 3 and resolved on their own . 
He had several courses of quinolones ( and other abx ) during this period without significant relief , but ultimately his symptoms improved on their own . 
His immune suppression was d / c ' d 7 / 7 4 . 
He deveoloped iron overload ( Ferritin 1 3 5 6 ) and started phlebotomy 9 / 7 4 . 
Mr . Ware did well from a respiratory standpoint until 1 1 / 7 4 when he noticed intermittent fevers approximately every 2 weeks . 
At first they were in the 9 9 range and they would last 1 - 2 days and be associated with malaise . 
He also again experienced symptoms of a dry hacking cough that occurs with change in positioning ( not necessarily lying flat ) . 
By the end of November , the fevers were a bit higher ( 1 0 0 . 5 ) . 
He saw his PCP who thought he might have PNA . 
He obtained a CXR and gave hime a course ofr azithromycin ( 5 d ) . 
His fevers improved . 
In early December , he began experienceing SOB with exertional dyspnea . 
He saw his PCP again who rx avelox . 
He got another CXR which showed some " fluid " and was strated on lasix . 
He was admitted from 1 2 / 2 1 - 0 1 / 0 2 . 
He was rate controlled and had minimal diuresis . 
Cardiac MRI suggested constrictive pericarditis and possible areas of active pericarditis . 
Right & amp ; left heart cath which showed no evidence of cosntriction hemodynamically . 
He had 1 temperature to 1 0 1 . 4 , and given his history he was seen by our service .

He and influenza / rsv / paraflu / adnevorus nasal swabs which were also negative . 
Sputum cultures grew oral flora . 
CMV VL , glucan , and galactomannan were also negative . 
He improved w / regard to SOB but cough persisted . 
He was seen by Dr . Vann who was concerned for an immunologic process given his bilateral pleural effusions & amp ; question of pericarditis . 
He had a URI syndrome in January that lasted 3 weeks then resolved . 
On February 1 9 th , he noticed the onset of low - grade temps ( 1 0 0 . 0 - 1 0 0 . 5 ) with malaise and mild chills . 
These happened nightly through . 
He saw his PCP 2 / 2 3 who rx moxifloxacin . 
He had no change in his symptoms . 
He had some mild rhinorrhea and mildly increased SOB .

The patient was seen by Dr . Kaminski . 
She has had no fevers , chills , or shortness of breath . 
She has had no recent travel . 
Her vital signs are stable . 
She is normocephalic , atraumatic . 
Pharynx and ENT is normal . 
Neck is supple and nontender .

Mood and affect is normal . 
Cranial nerves II through XII tested and intact . 
It seemed that there was T waves in V 3 . 
We thought this could be an SVT . 
It was not really consistent with an atrial fibrillation . 
INR is 1 . 
Briefly , he was admitted 6 / 2 0 / 6 2 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia . 
He was found to have perirectal abscess s / p CT - guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s / p removal and drainage in OR on 7 / 0 7 and by IR 7 / 2 2 , both sites positive for MSSA . 
Hospital course c / b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s / p ex - lap 6 / 2 2 , gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection , splenectomy and primary anastamosis , with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins . 
He also had VRE / klebsiella LUQ abscess s / p IR drainage . 
He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome , but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin . 
So he was switched to vanco / ambisome / linezolid / meropenem / amikacin for LUQ abscess . 
After 6 weeks of high - dose ambisome , he was taken back to OR on 7 / 3 1 for re - exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal - jejunostomy site that surgeons " scooped out " as much as they could , but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions . 
Given the inability to completely en - bloc resect Mr . Ethridge ' s GI mucor despite a long - trial of Ambisome , he was started on an investigational drug , posaconazole , provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis . 
This has had 5 0 % success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials . 
He was started on this drug on 8 / 2 8 / 6 2 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea , diarrhea . 
He has been at EDUCARE - FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip . 
He walks with a walker . 
He had repeat CT abd / pelvix 1 0 / 2 6 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection . 
He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain , without much output . 
He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition , despite po intake . 
He has been trying to eat , but reports some nausea and diarrhea , especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole . 
He reports good glycemic control . 
He denies fevers / abd pain / nightsweats / chills / visual changes / HA / melena / cough / SOB . 
Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well , but does have significant nausea , somewhat controlled with zofran . 
Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect , or due to dumping syndrome . 
Will need EKG again at EDUCARE - FARGO before transfer here . 
Mr . Ethridge seen and examined with Dr . Roberts . 
He is very slowly improving in terms of strength , no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN . 
Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea , although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects . 
On balance , if his labs are ok , I ' d favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings . 
ECG without QTc prolongation . 
Abdomen is bening . 
Left hip still sore , but more and more stable . 
The patient was doing well until a few days prior to admission when he noticed a swelling in his new graft and a decrease in the degree of its pulse . 
Then on the morning of admission when he noticed his graft was without a palpable pulse or thrill . 
The patient then presented to the EDUCARE - PULLMAN ER for evaluation and treatment . 
In the ER , the patient was found to have an engorged AV graft without dopplerable pulse or bruit . 
The patient was seen by surgery and an ultrasound of the upper extremity revealed a clotted graft and so the patient was admitted to the medical service for further evaluation and treatment . 
He further denies any shortness of breath , increased swelling in his legs , or changes in his weight . 
He does indicate that he has suffered from decreased oral intake lately secondary to feeling tired and having a decreased appetite . 
He is from Kazakhstan originally , has no family nearby and works as a Glazier . 
Unfortunately , graft eventually reclotted and was deemed unsalvageable - the patient was then started on HD via a tunnelled catheter . 
Was tolerating this well , until day prior to admission noted a fever prior to going to HD . 
Blood cultures taken yesterday at HD , returned today with GPC in clusters , further speciation to follow . 
Admitted for fever workup . 
Pt . 
Has a hx of abdominal mucormycosis resulting in chronic abdominal discomfort , which today is at baseline . 
No CP , SOB . 
He is from Kazakhstan originally , has no family nearby and works as a Glazier . 
ID - Likely catheter related infection , will continue vanco for now , await speciation of GPC . 
Will recx if spikes above 1 0 1 . 5 . 
FU urine cx . 
Vanco / Gent . 
Ultimately needs line out . 
I believe protein C can be influenced by ESRD , but not protein S . This needs to be followed up further . 
The patient has a history of multiple problems with access ( clots , stenoses ) , requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions . 
On July 2 5 , interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot , with no success , requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis . 
At present , patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow , for thrombectomy / revision . 
Of note , patient was admitted in April of 2 0 6 4 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur . 
Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo , presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter , started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin . 
ROS : No fever / chills , HA , SOB , CP , N / V / D ( though states that stomach sometimes " sensitive " ) . 
He is currently unable to pursue this field , due to his debilitated state , however he would like to try to intern , when he feels up to it . 
No tobacco , EtOH , illicits . 
Family History : Non - contributory . 
No ST changes or TWIs compared to prior in April 2 0 6 4 ( J point elevation in V 1 - V 3 in both ) . 
No new or enlarging infiltrates or masses . 
Slight fullness in the region of the right thyroid gland . 
Assessment and Plan : 5 9 yo Kazakhstani male , with HTN , DM , and ESRD on HD , and h / o access issues ( multiple thromboses , stenoses requiring frequent revisions ) and admitted with clotted left AVF for revision / thrombectomy in the OR . 
Access : clotted L AVF , functional left IJ tunneled cath .

She has had a prior cardiac work - up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT / SPECT in 2 0 6 2 and a negative ETT in 2 0 6 4 . 
An echo in 2 0 6 2 showed an EF of 6 5 % with no valvular abnormalities . 
She is currently well with no complaints . 
She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma . 
She does not check her blood sugars at home , although she has a glucometer . 
When asked if her sugars are ever low , she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia : dizziness and hot flashes . 
She ' s not had this recently . 
She also does not check her BP at home . 
She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers , or any chest pain . 
She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area . 
She follows a diabetic diet ( avoids sweets ) , gets no regular exercise , but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day . 
Diabetes . 
Checking A 1 C off medication . 
Would like to have patient check FS when she ' s feeling ill or if A 1 C is elevated . 
Will refer to NP for review glucometer use , diabetic diet . 
She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia . 
This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency . 
May try glyburide if A 1 C elevated . 
Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt .

Pt reportedly was last seen in USOH last night about 9 pm when peritoneal dialysis was started . 
She was found this AM with her dialysate fluid half run through and it was on the floor , she was unresponsive . 
Pt intermittenly responds to commands and is not speaking , so ROS is unabl to obtain at this point . 
She has a known seizure disorder secondary to hemmorragic CVA in past . 
Pt . 
Pt .

Head CT negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure . 
Pyuria - uncertian if significant due to the patient ' s likely minimal urine output - sent for culture - will await results - continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin ( 1 gram given in ED ) and ceftriaxone . 
Electrolyte abnormalities - patient on hemodialysis - will schedule for am - if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia . 
Although I ' m sure you are familiar with his history , I will review it now for our records . 
Dr . Rodriquez is a 7 7 - year - old retired Electrician at Wells Fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellent health until the past year . 
He denies any prior history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , chest pains , significant childhood illnesses or malignancy . 
He describes his usual baseline health as excellent . 
He is a religious walker , walking multiple times each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast . 
Dr . Rodriquez states that in approximately April or Mayof the past year he was first diagnosed with hyperglycemia . 
This was treated with Metformin . 
Subsequently Hydrochlorothiazide and Zestril were added apparently for hypertension ( although the patient does not believe he has been diagnosed with hypertension ) . 
He subsequently developed diarrhea which he felt was related to Glucophage which was subsequently reduced in dose . 
In June of the past year the patient was noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in his Hydrochlorothiazide . 
At that time he also was found to have lower extremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of the Hydrochlorothiazide . 
The patient states in September of 2 1 1 9 he traveled to trinidad and tobago . 
While in trinidad and tobago he had a marked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that he found it difficult to ambulate . 
He denied any difficulty with chest pains or shortness of breath . 
He had no hemoptysis and no focal unilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobility during the trip . 
He was seen by a Trinidad physician who prescribed an ethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edema significantly . 
However , he subsequently developed diarrhea to this medication and it was stopped . 
Subsequently his lower extremity has once again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses of Lasix and with the recent addition of Zaroxolyn . 
At the present time Dr . Rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath . 
RE : Jacob Rodriquez , M . D . 
He does find ambulating difficult due to the swelling in his lower extremities . 
He has no chest pain , has no cough , no sputum production , no hemoptysis . 
He has no fevers or chills . 
He believes his weight is increased by 3 5 pounds in the past several months . 
He believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation . 
He denies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does note that he ' s becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and is often napping in the reclining chair which is new for him . 
He denies any history of snoring . 
He has noted no new joint complaints although he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface of his right lower extremity as well as on his left arm . 
This has been present for approximately two or three months . 
Other than that he believes his bowel and bladder function is normal . 
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable . 
Type II diabetes as above . 
Anemia thought secondary to Hydrochlorothiazide . 
Past history of right bundle branch block . 
Current medications include Atenolol 2 5 mg daily , folic acid , Glucophage 8 5 0 mg bid , Lasix 1 2 0 mg daily , Lisinopril 1 5 mg daily , compression stockings , Metolazone 2 . 5 mg daily was added recently . 
Drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due to Hydrochlorothiazide . 
Family history is significant for diabetes mellitus . 
Social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is an immigrant from trinidad and tobago . 
He has been living in Haleyville since the early 2 0 5 9 ' s . 
He is a Electrician at Wells Fargo . 
He has minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards his bachelor ' s degree but none since then . 
He is a non tobacco user . 
He uses alcohol minimally . 
He ' s never had any blood transfusions . 
He lives with his wife . 
They have no pets . 
He does not enjoy any unusual hobbies not noted above . 
He has been exposed to tuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive PPD . 
On physical examination today Dr . Rodriquez weighs 1 9 3 pounds . 
Blood pressure is 1 3 6 / 9 0 . 
Pulse 8 3 and regular . 
Respiratory rate is 2 0 . 
Temperature is 9 6 . 8 . 
Resting oxygen saturation is 9 8 - 9 9 % with ambulation in the hallway . 
This fell to a minimum of 9 7 % with an increase in his heart rate to 1 0 0 . 
HEENT exam is significant for a clear oropharynx . 
Sclera are white . 
Conjunctiva are minimally pale .

RE : Jacob Rodriquez , M . D . 
Jugular venous distention to approximately 1 0 cm . 
Neck was supple . 
Examination of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullness at both bases . 
There was no egophony and no wheezes . 
Otherwise the lungs were clear . 
Cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm , normal S 1 and S 2 , an intermittent S 4 was appreciated . 
No RV heave or lift was appreciated . 
No pulmonary artery tap was appreciated . 
The pontic component of S 2 was moderately enhanced . 
No appreciable murmurs were detected . 
The point of maximum impulse was in the anterior axillary line . 
Examination of the abdomen revealed a nontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge , three fingerbreadths below the right costal margin . 
This was nontender and smooth . 
Minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well . 
Normal bowel sounds were present . 
Examination of the extremities reveal three plus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lower extremities , one plus edema was also present in both upper extremities . 
No clubbing was noted . 
There were no skin changes consistent with collagen vascular disease . 
Multiple follicular lesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh as well as on the left arm . 
Neurological exam was grossly nonfocal . 
Objective data include a CBC which most recently demonstrated a white count of 1 1 . 8 , hematocrit of 3 2 . 1 , platelet count of 2 5 0 . 
Differential was not remarkable . 
LVH is elevated at 5 9 9 , AST is most recently 2 2 . 
A urinalysis on 1 2 / 0 7 / 1 9 was negative for protein . 
No reportive cast was made . 
A CEA was notable for a level of 2 . 4 on 1 / 0 5 / 2 0 . 
An echocardiogram obtained on 1 2 / 2 2 / 1 9 demonstrated normal LV size with mild concentric LVH and preserved LV function . 
The right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypertrophied with mild reduction in RV function . 
There was trace MR with moderate TR . 
A peak systolic artery pressure of 6 4 plus right atrial pressure was noted . 
In summary Dr . Rodriquez is a 7 7 - year - old gentleman with a clear cut pulmonary hypertension . 
The etiology of this is not clear at the moment . 
Differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolic disease , occult underlying pulmonary disease ( doubt ) , obstructive sleep apnea , and collagen vascular disease . 
In addition some patients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in the setting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved left ventricular function although this I think would be a diagnosis of exclusion . 
The degree of his edema is quite striking and I agree with increasing his diuretic regimen . 
I ' m embarking on a course of evaluation to exclude the most likely causes . 
In specific he will be having a CT with IV contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolic disease this afternoon . 
This has already been arranged by Dr . Faust . 
In addition I ' m sending serology including an ANA , an antidouble stranded DNA and an anti SCL 7 0 . 
I ' ve also asked Dr . Rodriquez Page 4 Freeman Faust , M . D . 
RE : Jacob Rodriquez , M . D . 
He will be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formal pulmonary function testing performed in addition to having an arterial blood gas drawn . 
If this evaluation should be unrevealing , he may require more invasive diagnostics . 
I ' ve already consulted formally with Dr . Eddie Roy , the physician with most experience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he would be able to assist us in the further evaluation of Dr . Rodriquez if our workup is nondiagnostic . 
Dr . Faust , thank you again for referring Dr . Rodriquez for evaluation . 
I ' ll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks after his diagnostic tests have been performed . 
Please do not hesitate to call me with any further questions or concerns . 
Please refer to it . 
He does not look toxic . 
There was some mild surrounding cellulitis . 
The casts were symmetric and nontender . 
Blood cultures were sent . 
Surgery was consulted . 
Three / of four ulcers have healed . 
Seeing nurse daily for dressing changes .

Neuropathic ulcers on heel , left foot : ulcer on heel still open , with some drainage . 
Not adequately controlled on current regimen . 
Has heel pad to remove pressure . 
Has had shoes checked . 
Is to see Dr Ulbrich ' s nurse today for debridement . 
Last A 1 C very high . 
If still high , I think he needs much more help getting in control . 
Since he sees nurse daily , will have to ask for her to check sugars , adjust meds after . 
Really overall not doing well . 
Diabetes : will check A 1 C and sugar . 
Will contact VNA to begin sugars by VNA so we can try and control better . 
Tends to run high WBC , low lymphs , high ESR . 
May need heme consult . 
Chronic renal failure . 
He has been on dialysis for the past four years . 
He is currently dialyzed two times per week . 
He apparently had been three times per week in the past .

He is due for dialysis tomorrow , however . 
I gave him a prescription for atenolol 2 5 mg p . o . 
Adult health maintenance . 
I gave him a prescription for aspirin , which he should be taking and asked him to return in two weeks for a full annual review . 
I instructed him to show renal staff the prescriptions tomorrow at dialysis . 
The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday . 
The session was uneventful , and he finished dialysis around 7 : 3 0 pm . 
Around 9 pm , he started noting un - controlable jerky movements of his jaw , arms , and legs . 
He was unable to stand by himself , and had difficulty with any motor activity . 
It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself , and needed help from his wife to do so . 
The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better , and his daughter called his PCP ' s office today , at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED . 
He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2 0 9 2 , when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis ( see note in LMR by neurology consultant ) . 
He has been symptom - free since that time . 
He reports no other new events . 
He denies any new medications . 
He lives with his wife in Mount Airy . 
He lives with his wife in Mount Airy . 
He has five adult children . 
Pulmonary : ( - ) shortness of breath . 
Cardiovascular : ( - ) chest pain , palpitations . 
While he did get dialysis yesterday per his normal schedule , it is odd that his potassium today is 5 . 5 , suggesting perhaps either dietary indiscretion ( which he denies ) or , perhaps , inadequate dialysis . 
Chronic renal failure .

As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father ' s care . 
The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home ( on 2 nd floor ) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker ; their two sons are very involved as well . 
Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion , agitation , and labile emotions . 
They noted he has been confused about location , time ( recalls distant past but not recent past ) , and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife . 
He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated . 
His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications . 
His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander . 
They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 1 5 min to get up and appears unsteady . 
About 1 wk ago , while his wife was out of their home , he wandered out and locked himself out ; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out . 
Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week . 
They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0 . 5 - 1 mg Q 4 h prn which brought mild improvement . 
Out of concern for his father ' s and mother ' s safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them . 
They have not noticed fever / chills , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea / constipation ( on aggressive regimen ) , complaints of pain , vision changes . 
They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days . 
Exam was notable only for rales bilaterally and mild - moderate agitation . 
CXR was normal . 
CBC was at baseline . 
UA pending . 
CT brain could not be performed due to agitation . 
They spoke to his PCP who felt this was all due to progression of his dementia . 
He was given ativan 2 mg IV ( total ) and haldol 5 mg IV ( total ) . 
Also got labetalol PO 2 0 0 mg PO x 1 . 
They have an appt with Dr . Daniel in September . 
Mother had breast cancer . 
Sons are very involved .

Continue ASA . 
PCP and family have elected to not pursue further surgical workup . 
He was diagnosed with progressive shortness of breath in 2 0 7 8 . 
He was treated with diuretics and other medications at that time . 
He did quite well until December of last year when he had a cardiac arrest and underwent ICD placement . 
He has had worsening symptoms over the last year with increasing shortness of breath on flat ground and a very severe shortness of breath with stairs . 
He has had some episodic nature to this . 
Two days prior to admission , he had relatively rapid onset of shortness of breath while trying to play pool . 
This recurred several times associated with diaphoresis . 
He had no palpitations at that time . 
He has no chest discomfort . 
His past medical history is significant for history of shower emboli and TIA in 2 0 8 1 . 
He has diabetes . 
He had spinal stenosis surgery in 2 0 7 8 . 
His current medical regimen is Bumex 3 , recently decreased from 1 2 due to worsening renal function . 
He is on spironolactone described as 6 . 2 5 daily , digoxin 0 . 1 2 5 , Toprol - XL 1 2 . 5 . 
He has been on carvedilol , which was changed due to dizziness . 
He is on lisinopril 1 . 2 5 mg and has had great difficulty tolerating any higher dose due to dizziness . 
He is on metolazone 2 . 5 weekly . 
He takes Coumadin 7 . 5 mg most days . 
He is on insulin and Lantus . 
He has no known drug allergies . 
His family history is essentially unremarkable . 
Mother unknown , father had onset of angina in his 8 0 s . 
The patient lives with his wife and son and is a retired Fire Chief . 
He had an 8 0 - pack - year smoking history but quit four years ago . 
He has one glass of alcohol every 1 - 2 weeks . 
Review of systems is negative for any problems with fevers , chills , change in his bowel or bladder habits . 
He has no problems with swallowing . 
He has no problems with hearing or vision . 
Review of systems is otherwise negative . 
On physical examination , blood pressure is 8 4 / 6 6 in the left arm and 8 6 / 6 2 in the right arm . 
His chest is completely clear to auscultation and percussion . 
Temperature is 3 5 . 9 . 
His heart rate is 1 0 0 and a regular rhythm . 
His cardiac exam reveals left ventricular heave , which is visible . 
He has a palpable and audible third heart sound . 
The right ventricular impulse is present also . 
He has a systolic murmur , which is heard everywhere , not otherwise easy to characterize . 
It does not change with respiration . 
The second component of the second sound is slightly increased in radiation consistent with a PA systolic pressure in the range of 5 0 - 6 0 . 
His legs are cool . 
Venous pattern is very prominent . 
His pulses are intact peripherally . 
He has no abdominal bruits . 
His jugular venous pressure is 1 4 cm . 
He has no cervical adenopathy or thyromegaly . 
His liver percusses at approximately 5 cm below the costal margin . 
He has some increased resonance around the umbilicus . 
Laterally , there is suggestion of some fluid in the distention . 
There is no peripheral edema . 
His joints are without obvious deformities , although he describes arthritis in his shoulder , neck , and back . 
He has no skin rashes or sores , several very small ecchymoses . 
His standing blood pressure is unchanged . 
He has atrially triggered ventricular pacing at 9 8 . 
ASSESSMENT : 1 . 
Etiology of left ventricular dysfunction is undetermined . 
We do not know information of recent catheterization or echocardiography . 
The degree of his mitral disease is not clear . 
He clearly did not have coronary artery disease on one studied initially . 
However , the episodicity is significant . 
Current hemodynamic status shows marked volume overload and low cardiac output , and is cold and wet pattern . 
His history of recent diuretic use suggests that he may have had relatively rapid onset of fluid after his last diuretic change . 
However , the episode while playing pool also raises the possibility of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia undetected . 
It is also possible that this is related to angina . 
Other related risks . 
He is on Coumadin due to his embolic shower before . 
It is possible that he has had other emboli , possibly even to coronary arteries leading to recent decline in function . 
There are no obvious contraindications to transplant . 
At this time , we are not planning to evaluate him but to treat the urgency of his heart failure decompensation . 
Our plan is to hold his beta - blockers and ACE inhibitors for now , and to begin him on an IV diuretic infusion . 
We will proceed with echocardiogram and catheterization if necessary to determine whether there are other conditions exacerbating his current decompensated state . 
Check blood sugars before meals and at bedtime . 
In addition , some meals you may want to check your blood sugar ( blood glucose or BG ) 1 hour after taking your Novolog . 
If it is over 1 5 0 you may need to take more Novolog with meals or decrease your carbohydrate intake . 
You do not have to do this at every meal and you can alternate meals and / or days . 
For example : Sat check before and after breakfast ; Friday - lunch ; Thursday - supper , etc . 
Be careful of the amount of carbohydrates ( breads , pasta , cereal , fruit , etc ) you eat at each meal and between meals . 
Try to average about 6 0 gms . 
Your insulin may need adjusting several times before those goals can be met . 
When exercising you may need more carbs or less Novolog with meals . 
Do not mix with any other insulin . 
It has no peak . 
Novolog starts to work in 1 5 minutes and lasts about 2 hours . 
It peaks in about 1 hour . 
You need to eat enough carbs to cover this insulin or you will have a low blood sugar . 
Do not mix the two insulins . 
Do not take standing dose insulin at bedtime . 
Have your blood sugar checked 1 to 2 hours after taking novolog at bedtime to make sure you haven ' t gone too low . 
If you are below 8 0 then have a snack and juice to hold you over until morning . 
Bring this paper and your blood sugar results from the time you were discharged . 
For urgent problems or questions about your blood sugar or insulin call 3 8 7 - 8 2 6 7 and ask for the page operator . 
Have beeper # 6 8 5 3 7 paged ( the diabetes specialist on - call will call you back if you leave a message ) . 
You may also try my pager anytime ( 3 0 5 6 8 ) but I am not always available . 
He is doing quite well . 
There are no exertional complaints of dyspnea or chest discomfort . 
He is taking his medications without problems and denies fever , cough , rash or diarrhea . 
He tells me his blood pressures at home are as high as 1 4 0 - 1 6 0 in the morning systolic dropping to the 1 3 0 systolic in the evenings . 
His current medications are unchanged and include Neoral 1 2 5 mg b . i . d . , prednisone 1 5 mg daily , CellCept 1 g b . i . d . , aspirin 3 2 5 mg daily , Bactrim double strength one tablet every other day , calcium and vitamin D one tablet b . i . d . , diltiazem CD 2 4 0 mg q . a . m . 
On exam , he looks great . 
His blood pressure is 1 6 6 / 9 8 initially , 1 4 8 / 8 2 on repeat . 
His heart rate is 1 1 0 . 
He weighs 1 6 3 pounds . 
His head and neck examination is unremarkable . 
His venous pressures are less than 7 cm of water . 
The lungs are clear . 
The cardiac exam reveals a tachycardic rhythm with no rub , murmur or gallop . 
The abdomen is unremarkable . 
His numerous surgical wounds are well healed . 
His extremities are warm without edema . 
Electrocardiography is notable for sinus tachycardia at 1 0 8 beats per minute , some nonspecific ST changes . 
He underwent right heart catheterization and biopsy today . 
His right atrial pressure was 5 . 
His wedge pressure was 1 7 . 
His PA pressures were 4 0 / 2 0 with a mean of 3 0 . 
The biopsy results are pending at the time of this dictation . 
In summary , the patient is doing well now six weeks after cardiac transplantation . 
We will be making changes to his immunosuppressive regimen as dictated by the results of his blood work and biopsy . 
It is very gratifying to see how well he is doing . 
We will be sure to update you on a regular basis . 
He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 0 3 / 3 0 / 2 0 8 4 and returns now for his annual evaluation . 
In the interval since last seen , he has done reasonably well . 
His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 5 5 % by echocardiography and no coronary disease , although left anterior descending was tortuous . 
Filling pressures were normal , then with a wedge of 1 5 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 3 0 / 1 9 with a mean of 2 5 . 
The patient does have a herniated disk at L 4 and stenosis at L 5 . 
He has lower extremity cramps , which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol . 
The Pravachol was therefore stopped , restarted , and stopped again . 
He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A 1 c was 6 . 6 . 
He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia . 
He has had no dermatologic evaluation . 
He denies angina , congestive heart failure , or arrhythmias . 
Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water . 
Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits . 
There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung . 
Point of maximum impulse is not displaced . 
First heart sound is normal , second crisp and clear . 
He has an S 4 at the left sternal border . 
The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly . 
There is no peripheral edema . 
Peripheral pulses are diminished . 
The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle - branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 9 8 beats per minute . 
There are nonspecific T - wave changes particularly in the early precordium . 
This will include blood work , chest x - ray , echocardiogram , metabolic exercise stress test , cardiac catheterization , coronary angiography , and endomyocardial biopsy . 
We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him . 
We will transmit the results to you as well at that time .

Be on time . 
He RTC . 
HPI : This visit was supposed to be a preoperative visit prior to his scheduled Feb . 0 2 right inguinal hernia repair with Dr . Yamaguchi . 
However , when I saw him in Dec he had inadequate BP control despite Dr . Arias doubling his Lisinopril . 
I DCed Atenolol and switched him to Labetalol 1 0 0 mg BID . 
Despite some confusion I believe he has done this . 
He had also been switched from Crestor to Lipitor due to safety concerns . 
Hypertension : continues to be inadequate in a diabetic . We have limited options ; increasing Lisinopril did not add much . 
Switch to Labetalol did not help , but he is also not beta - blocked ( HR 7 2 ) so I am increasing Labetalol to 2 0 0 mg BID . 
Diabetes : control has been good . 
Hyperlipidemia : we may need to increase Lipitor and / or add Zetia . 
Right inguinal hernia : RTC one week for hopefully better pre - op . 
Neck is supple . 
Mucous membranes are dry . 
The remainder of the exam is unremarkable . 
This is close to the patient ' s baseline .

Rest as above . 
According to the patient , she left the hospital , completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2 / 2 4 , and continued to feel poorly , with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum . 
No fever , chills , sweats , myalgias , or SOB . 
Yesterday , she developed worsening pain , especially in her ribs , extending across the anterior surface ; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough . 
She is unable to ambulate , as she states she does at baseline with a walker . 
This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year ( there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well ) . 
She received 7 5 0 mg levofloxacin , 1 g vancomycin , nebulizer treatments , and morphine for pain control . 
She also complains of the chronic cough described above . 
No CP , SOB , dysuria , pyuria , N / V / D . 
She was treated with nebulizers , tamiflu , and azithromycin for 5 days . 
Hospitalized in January for hypotension & # 8 2 1 2 ; - required CCU level of care ; ultimately believed to be secondary to narcotics overdose . 
NECK : Supple . 
Could not appreciate IJ . 
No lymphadenopathy . 
Heart : RRR . 
No m / r / g . 
Bowel sounds present . 
In the absence of other symptoms ( new O 2 requirement , SOB , pleuritic chest pain , fevers / chills ) , a diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult to make . 
However , she is on chronic steroids and narcotics at baseline and may not mount a typical symptomatic response . 
A viable long - term plan for outpatient management is essential . 
He has had a series of illness over the spring , beginning with a hospitalization for pneumonia in June . 
He later developed what was thought to be a splenic subcapsular hematoma ( on Coumadin for chronic atrial fibrillation ) and then subsequently developed LUQ pain and was found to have a splenic abscess that was drained . 
At the time of his admission , he was found to have diabetes . 
He has been treated with Lantus insulin , most recently 1 5 Units at bedtime , on which regimen he has had consistent overnight drops , often to hypoglycemic levels . 
He reports that he weighed about 2 0 0 pounds before this illness but has lost about 5 0 pounds . 
Not aware of any history of coronary artery disease . 
Full EOM ' s . 
No gallops .

After he is through with surgical procedure , it is unlikely that he will need insulin . 
Thanks . 
Mr . Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm , as you know . 
He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October . 
During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed . 
He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm . 
He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery . 
Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot . 
In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well . 
The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first , second and third toes . 
He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through . 
He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot . 
He has no evidence of fevers , chills , rigors or shakes in the interim . 
He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe . 
His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity . 
He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports . 
On exam today he is doing quite well . 
He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital . 
His head and neck exams were unremarkable . 
His lungs were clear . 
Heart was regular . 
His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely , however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound . 
With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration . 
There is no evidence of cellulitis , induration or infection of the right lower extremity . 
He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left . 
Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today , which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle . 
He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level . 
This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot . 
His left calf , ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar . 
In summary , this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity . 
He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity . 
Given this concern , I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb - threatening gangrene of the left . 
With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re - evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter . 
I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes . 
My thanks again for this referral . 
I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier . 
With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary . 
During his prior admission in September , he underwent diagnostic angio which showed occluded R SFA , thrombosed R popliteal aneurysm and occluded R posterior tibial artery . 
On 1 0 / 0 1 , he underwent a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w / saphenous vein graft ; revised intraoperatively w / AK pop to BK pop BPG using 8 mm PTFE and angioplasty to the R PTA . 
He has been doing well since discharge in October . 
His dry gangrene is stable and well demarcated . 
He uses a special shoe at home for walking on RLE to offset weight on his toes and heel . 
He denies recent h / o fevers / chills , N / V , abdominal pain , or neurological sx . 
Well healed - LUQ transverse incision . 
Extremities : Skin is dry bilateral feet . 
RLE : Dry gangrene of entire 1 st toe 2 nd and 3 rd toes , tips of 4 th and 5 th toes and forefoot . 
R heel w / 5 cm x 3 cm eschar on posteriolateral surface . 
He has since undergone a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w / saphenous vein graft and 8 mm PTFE w / angioplasty to the R PTA . 
In March of this year he underwent a distal bpg from the R posterior tibial artery to the plantar artery and then a R TMA later that month . 
His R TMA has healed well since then . 
He is also s / p L fem - pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm . 
He saw Dr . Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left , however on the right he appears to have a high - grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft . 
The more distal graft on the right , which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent . 
He denies recent h / o fevers / chills , N / V , abdominal pain , or neurological sx . 
He c / o some RLE edema for the past 3 weeks . 
His PCP put him on a water pill but it had no effect . 
He continues on coumadin for graft patentcy . 
His last dose was Saturday . 
Extremities : Skin is dry on bilateral feet . 
CXR - lungs clear , heart size upper limit of normal . 
He will undergo angiogram with possible angioplasty of graft stenosis . 
She subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in April of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis . 
She present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room . 
Mrs . Haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss , early satiety , night sweats and fatigue . 
He abdominal pain is described as a sharp to achy pain that started in her right side , progressed to her epigastric and suprapubic are and then her left side . 
Currently it is diffuse associated with nausea and vomiting . 
She denies bowel problems has had some difficulty with urination and some frequency since admission but this is generally not a problem . 
ROS is also pertinet for HA which are chronic and palpations both of which are hard to describe . 
ROS : In detail otherwise unremarkable . 
No Hx of sarcoid or TB in the family . 
The patient has no known asbestos exposure . 
The patient is widowed with four children and is retired from her former job at Lowe ' s . 
She was born in Georgia moved to Chelsea in the 5 0 ' s and the only place she has visited was Augusta . 
No TB exposures or risk factors . 
States she had been tested for TB in the past years ago . 
No beryllium exposure . 
There isborderline concentric left ventricular hypertrophy . 
Overall left ventricularfunction is normal . 
The estimated ejection fraction is 6 0 % . 
There are noregional wall motion abnormalities . 
Otherwise unremarkable . 
Bladder calculus . 
Adrenal nodules , unchanged . 
Bilateral adrenal nodules . 
Cx data was not obtained . 
However , hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors . 
Clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis . 
At this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids . 
At this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and Dr . Villalpando . 
Will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow . 
There is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until Dr . Villalpando is available to speak with Mrs . Haynes . 
Thank you for this interesting consult . 
Please call with questions . 
Patient seen examine and case discussed with Dr . Layton . 
She comes with her daughter who assists with the history . 
I will review her history for the record . 
She is a 6 9 - year - old right - handed woman who was hospitalized at the Promptcare in July 2 1 0 3 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing , memory loss , and weight loss . 
Her daughter notes that she had deteriorated over the course of a month or two . 
Her movements slowed down , and she became unsteady on her feet , and her memory deteriorated . 
This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization . 
During that hospitalization a head CT on 7 / 2 5 / 0 3 was reported unremarkable . 
An MRI of the brain on 7 / 2 8 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus . 
There was no abnormal enhancement . 
This was consistent with small vessel stroke . 
EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features . 
An LP showed normal glucose ( 7 4 ) , elevated protein ( 1 0 2 ) , lymphocytic pleocytosis ( 1 8 - 2 0 WBC , 5 6 - 6 9 % lymphocytes , 2 9 - 4 0 % monocytes , and 2 - 4 % neutrophils ) and 0 - 1 RBC . 
CSF ACE was normal . 
Cultures were negative . 
CSF VDRL was negative . 
Because she has a history of sarcoidosis , it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis . 
She was started on prednisone 4 0 mg daily . 
Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone , but she remains abnormal . 
She has lowered the prednisone to 1 0 mg daily now . 
Reviewing the laboratory studies today , I see that although an RPR was non - reactive , a TA - IgG was positive , and the confirming treponemal tests ( FTA ) was also positive at the state lab . 
She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis . 
Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na ( 1 3 3 ) and Mg ( 1 . 3 ) , normal vitamin B 1 2 , folate , TSH , and ESR ( 2 0 ) . 
CSF HSV PCR was negative . 
HbA 1 C was elevated at 8 . 6 . 
She has a history of asthma going back many years . 
According to her daughter , she had a skin lesion excised from near her left eye about two years ago . 
Apparently , this showed noncaseated granuloma , and that is when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was first made . 
She then had a mediatinoscopy on 4 / 1 0 / 0 2 . 
Biopsy of mediastinal nodes showed granulomatous inflammation without caseating necrosis , supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis . 
She has type II DM , HTN , hypercholesterolemia , GERD , and she has had a thyroid adenoma . 
Her current medications are prednisone 1 0 mg daily , aspirin 8 1 mg daily , troglitazone , metformin , glyburide , sisinoril , pravastatin , vitamin D , calcium CO 3 , Colace , and an inhaler for her asthma as needed . 
She is allergic to sulfa agents and to fluticasone nasal spray . 
There is no history of allergy to PCN . 
Her parents both died of some type of cancer . 
There is no family history of sarcoidosis or of neurologic disease . 
She is a widow . 
She has four children . 
She used to work for Lowe ' s . 
She now lives with a daughter . 
She has had no recent fever or chills . 
Her weight has been stable and her appetite good . 
There is no history of exertional chest pain or palpitations . 
There is no history of cough , dyspnea , nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea . 
She has had no rash or joint symptoms . 
Pulse 1 2 6 , regular . 
BP 1 2 6 / 6 6 . 
She is obese . 
Ears , nose , and throat are clear . 
There are no cranial bruits . 
The neck is supple with full carotid pulses and no bruits . 
There are wheezes bilaterally . 
The heart is regular with no murmur . 
The abdomen is benign . 
The extremities are normal . 
There is general psychomotor slowing . 
She is oriented to time , expect that she gets the date off by two days as Aug 3 1 . 
She is oriented to place . 
She is inattentive . 
She is able to recite the months in order , but she gets lost trying to recite them in reverse . 
She has trouble registering 4 words , and she recalls only 2 of 4 after three minutes . 
There is no aphasia . 
She cannot copy interlocking pentagons and her copy of a 3 D cube shows poor spacial representation . 
The visual fields are full . 
The pupils are 3 mm and normally reactive . 
The fundi are poorly visualized . 
The eye movements are full and conjugate with no nystagmus ; pursuit movement are saccadic . 
Facial sensation is intact . 
Facial power is normal and symmetric . 
Hearing is grossly intact . 
Weber and Rinne tests are normal . 
The palate elevates normal . 
Gag is present . 
The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius power are normal . 
The tongue protrudes in the midline . 
Muscle bulk , tone , and power are normal . 
There is a low - amplitude , high - frequency tremor in action and rest . 
Temperature and pinprick sensation are diminished in the lower extremities with a distally - predominant gradient . 
Reflexes are normal ( 2 / 4 ) and symmetric in the upper extremities and at the knees and absent at the ankles . 
Plantar responses are flexor . 
Coordination is intact . 
Romberg is negative . 
Gait and station are normal . 
Her treponemal test for syphilis came back positive from the hospitalization in July . 
Since syphilis , too , could cause noncaseating granulomas , and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated , this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis . 
I will review that issue with you and with Dr , Villalpando . 
She had CSF pleocytosis in July . 
With that and the positive treponemal test ( FTA ) , she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis . 
I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services . 
Concerning her need for prednisone , I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis . 
If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis , then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course , her CSF , and her syphilis serologies . 
Finally , from the MRI of 7 / 2 8 , shows a couple of tiny foci of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus . 
These are most consistent with small vessel ischemic strokes . 
She has multiple risk factors for common small vessel disease and stroke , but in the context of her inflammatory CSF and evidence of prior syphilis , we must also consider cerebrovascular syphilis as the likely cause of this . 
I would recommend treatment now with a 1 4 - day course of high - dose ( 2 0 - 2 4 million units a day ) penicillin . 
She is already on prednisone which might help to prevent any possible Jarisch - Herxheimer reaction . 
I think that if she remains stable after the initiation of her PCN therapy , then we can plan to taper and then discontinue the prednisone , to follow her clinically and with repeated LP , and determine any need for future corticosteroid therapy on her course . 
Thank you for this consultation . 
Patient is unable to give a reliable history ; history from daughter Inez Haynes , whom I called on the phone , and from LMR ( primarily Dr . Keondre Viera ' s August neurology note ) . 
Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2 1 0 3 . 
She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2 1 0 3 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing , memory loss , and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months . 
Head CT on 7 / 2 5 / 0 3 with only mild ventriculomegaly . 
An MRI of the brain on 7 / 2 8 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus . 
There was no abnormal enhancement . 
This was consistent with small vessel stroke . 
EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features . 
She had normal vitamin B 1 2 , folate , TSH , and ESR ( 2 0 ) . 
CSF HSV PCR was negative . 
HbA 1 C was elevated at 8 . 6 . 
An LP showed normal glucose ( 7 4 ) , elevated protein ( 1 0 2 ) , lymphocytic pleocytosis ( 1 8 - 2 0 WBC , 5 6 - 6 9 % lymphocytes , 2 9 - 4 0 % monocytes , and 2 - 4 % neutrophils ) and 0 - 1 RBC . 
CSF ACE was normal . 
Cultures were negative . 
CSF VDRL was negative . 
She was initially treated with prednisone 4 0 mg daily tapered down to 1 0 mg daily . 
In follow up , it was noted that RPR was non - reactive , a TA - IgG was positive , and the confirming treponemal tests ( FTA ) was also positive at the state lab . 
This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w / 1 4 days of IV penicillin . 
Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w / neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis . 
Per her daughter , patient had improved back to being independent of ADL ' s and walking with a cane witout assistance . 
Over the last few weeks , she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls . 
Has trouble standing now , seems unsteady on her feet , has been primarily in bed for the last few days , requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down . 
Over the last several days , she has become even more globally weak and confused . 
She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house , thinking that they are there ; thinking that the closet is the bathroom . 
It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days . 
Patient reports intermittent headaches . 
On presentation to the ED , she was noted to be tachycardic in the 1 2 0 ' s ( baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months , being worked up by cards ) , normotensive , afebrile , oriented x 2 , and moving all extremities . 
Neurologic : Except as above , there have been no changes in vision or hearing , neck pain , tinnitus , vertigo , numbness , speaking , language , swallowing , or gait .

Difficulty w / complex commands . 
Repetition and naming intact . 
Can read very large print . 
Memory : 3 / 3 at 1 minute ; 0 / 3 at 5 mins but recalls all 3 w / category prompts .

Chronic periventricular white matter changes are again noted . 
There is no significant soft tissue swelling or calvarial fracture . 
Prominent calcifications of a falx cerebri are incidentally noted . 
Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear . 
There is bilateral exophthalmus . 
Clinical correlation and interval follow - up is recommended . 
EKG : sinus tachy . 
Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events . 
Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities . 
Head CT unremarkable . 
Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above , though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid . 
She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities , and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms , she should have repeat LP . 
She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology . 
This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO ' s , but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion . 
CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA , but with normal WBC , no URI sx ' s or cough , and no fever , I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically . 
She is here with her daughter . 
She notes that she is mostly feeling tired lately . 
She is able to walk with help and is even unable to walk upstairs with assistance . 
She is here in a wheelchair and says she is kind of tired and lets her daughter gives most of the history even when asked simple questions . 
She has been checking her blood sugars and she shows me the results . 
In the morning , the sugars have been fairly low in the 5 7 - 1 0 0 range , around noontime high at 1 4 4 up to 3 9 8 , and in the evening high again 1 7 6 - 2 4 5 . 
She is taking Lantus 3 8 units at 9 : 0 0 p . m . and she is on NovoLog coverage less than 2 5 - 0 units , 1 2 5 - 1 5 2 units , 1 5 1 - 2 0 4 units , 2 0 1 - 2 5 6 units , 2 5 1 - 3 0 8 units and greater than 3 1 0 units . 
She would like to switch over her Lantus to the Pens since the pen is so much easier for her . 
She complains of hemorrhoids , although she says they are actually getting better , she had previously had four now she has two . 
There is no bleeding . 
There is no pain , kind of itchy and uncomfortable . 
She is in fact not having any problem with constipation at this time . 
She is having bowel movements every day . 
She is not having any chest pain , no trouble breathing , no fevers , sweats or chills .

A delightful woman , English speaking and sitting in a wheelchair . 
Quite alert , did know the president , could not recall the vice - president or against whom the president ran in the last election . 
She did know the day of the week and she knew where she was . 
She also remembered to remind me about a prescription when both her daughter and I almost forgot . 
She is an absolutely delightful woman , appears well and alert despite the fact that she lets her daughter provides most of the history and responses . 
She appears comfortable , breathing easily , no use of accessory muscles of inspiration , speaking in full sentences , no cough , no spine or flank tenderness . 
Heart sounds S 1 , S 2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop . 
Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly with no rales , wheezes , or rhonchi . 
She is clear to percussion . 
Diabetes . 
Her A 1 c today was 6 . 6 , which represents excellent control despite a fairly high glucoses she was recording . 
I therefore did not want to increase her regimen despite the high glucoses . 
We will continue for now . 
I did give her an appointment with the diabetes nurse for help in management of her diabetes . 
Hypertension . 
Her blood pressure is fine . 
We will continue current regimen . 
We will check electrolytes . 
Tachycardia actually improved relative to her last visit . 
She is asymptomatic in this regard except for some fatigue . 
Fatigue . 
This is most likely due to stepping down from the prednisone 6 0 - 4 0 . 
This is what the patient and her daughter believe . 
She was somewhat fatigued before , but they note that it is worse with this . 
She does need to come off the prednisone and Dr . Villalpando who she just saw is going to try to come up with another plan for her . 
Check cbc . 
Acid associated symptoms well controlled with omeprazole . 
Right knee mild osteoarthritis , not a problem today . 
CNS syphilis status post treatment . 
Question of CNS sarcoid currently on 4 0 mg of prednisone and hopefully she will be able to come off of that and perhaps get started on something else . 
Cholesterol . 
We will recheck her cholesterol today and will check an SGPT . 
Thyroid nodules . 
Ultrasound in July 2 1 0 3 showed stability . 
Adrenal adenoma . 
Her CAT scan in May 2 1 0 2 showed stability and some adenopathy consistent with sarcoid . 
Lichen simplex chronicus . 
Dermatology diagnosis from 2 1 0 1 . 
Not addressed today . 
Hopefully , she will be stronger at her next visit and we can recheck . 
Osteopenia . 
Glaucoma suspect , not addressed today . 
Small vessel ischemic disease . 
MRI from July showed changes consistent with small vessel ischemic stroke . 
She is currently on aspirin and stable . 
Hemorrhoids - anusolHC given . 
Given no bleeding and no pian , this hopefully will fuffice . 
Recommended avoiding constipation , as she is doing , with lots of dietary fruits and vegetables . 
HgA 1 C 6 . 6 CBC slightly elevated WBC likely due to prednisone SGPT , lytes o . k . 
The patient reports that she woke up around noon after going to bed feeling just fine around midnight . 
She then called a friend and realized that her speech was slurred . 
She waited for her symptoms to improve , and when they did not resolve , she called a cab to take her to her CH medical office . 
While there , she noticed tremors of her hands b / l ; she was given an additional ASA 3 2 5 mg today . 
She has never had similar symptoms in the past . 
She denies headache , vision changes , dizziness , or difficulty walking with this episode today . 
She feels otherwise well . 
She reports that she discovered her prior stroke when she noted she felt more dizzy and unsteady and obtained an MRI which showed an old cerebellar infarct . 
Admit to Neurology floor service for observation and w / u including : CT / CTA , MRI / MRA , stroke labs ( ESR , TSH , CRP , lipoprotein a , homocysteine ) , TTE with bubble study , Holter monitor placement . 
SBP 1 4 0 - 1 8 0 for now . 
Given that stroke may have occurred while patient was taking ASA , will administer Aggrenox . 
Pt reports she is eating well , therefore no need for swallow evaluation . 
Plan discussed with Neurology Senior , Veleria Blackwell . 
Betty Gillis is a very pleasant 7 3 - year - old woman who was recently admitted to the Griffin Memorial Hospital in early February 2 0 8 5 with a right MCA territory stroke characterized clinically by drooling and left hand weakness . 
Fortunately , her symptoms have now resolved and she is back to her regular activities . 
We understand that she has also had previous strokes . 
In December 2 0 8 2 , she was suffering a dizzy spell and subsequently an MRI of her brain found a posterior circulation cerebellar infarct as well as a couple of basal ganglia lacunar infarct . 
She recalls having only V 2 clinical events . 
She was worked up in the Griffin Memorial Hospital and had a Holter , which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with minor ectopy only , an echocardiogram , which was reported as essentially normal with the exception of a positive saline contrast bubble study suggesting a patent foramen ovale , an MRI of her head which demonstrated the infarct and marked microvascular disease , as well as a CT angiogram of her head and neck arteries , which demonstrated mild atheroma for the most part with a left internal carotid artery stenosis that was less than 5 0 % . 
She is referred to us today for an opinion as to how to manage the possible patent foramen ovale . 
This lady has never had cardiac problems otherwise . 
There is no history of atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure . 
She does not get exertional chest discomfort ( chest pain or shortness of breath ) and has no history of syncope or presyncope . 
She has no history of PND , orthopnea or edema . 
She remains fairly active despite her ataxic gait . 
She tells me that she is able to walk several blocks without difficulty and never has any exertional chest pains or shortness of breath . 
Moreover , she does not have claudication . 
Functional inquiry is otherwise unremarkable save for her usual difficulties with psoriasis and eczema . 
She denies difficulties with heartburn or GI bleeding recently . 
Past Medical History : 1 . 
Stroke . 
Hypertension 3 . 
Dyslipidemia . 
Insulin insensitivity 5 . 
Ex - smoker ( 1 - 1 - 1 / 2 packs per day for approximately 4 0 years , quit approximately 1 2 years ago ) . 
Possible patent foramen ovale . 
Degenerative joint disease / osteoarthritis . 
Status bilateral total knee replacement in 2 0 8 4 . 
Osteoporosis . 
Bladder incontinence . 
There is no history of other cardiac problems . 
There is no history of venous thromboembolic disease . 
This lady has not had frank diabetes . 
Current Medical Therapy : 1 . 
Aggrenox 2 5 / 2 0 0 p . o . 
Prilosec 2 0 mg p . o . 
Doxepin 2 5 mg daily . 
Simvastatin 4 0 mg p . o . 
Atenolol 1 2 . 5 mg p . o . 
Fosamax 7 0 mg every week . 
BLANK 1 tab daily . 
Darifenacin 7 . 5 mg daily . 
She believes that her biological father suffered a stroke at some point , but cannot say for certain how old he was . 
She is a retired Secretary . 
She is an ex - smoker ( more than 4 0 pack years ) , but does not drink significant amounts of alcohol . 
She has no other history of substance abuse . 
She has no other new symptoms . 
There is no recent GI bleeding . 
She has difficulties with bladder incontinence as well . 
On physical examination today , her heart rate is 8 6 beats per minute and regular and her blood pressure is 1 2 2 / 7 8 in the right arm and 1 2 4 / 8 0 in the left arm . 
Respiratory rate is 2 0 and she is pink on room air . 
Head and neck exam is unremarkable . 
There are no carotid bruits . 
She has some kyphoscoliosis of her spine . 
Her chest examination reveals no dullness to percussion and vesicular breath sounds only . 
Her jugular venous pressure is not elevated . 
Central pulses are normal in volume and contour . 
Her apex beat is within normal limits . 
Heart sounds include a normal S 1 and S 2 with no murmurs . 
Her abdomen is soft and nontender . 
There are no obvious masses . 
Her aorta does not obviously appear to be enlarged . 
Her pulses are palpable in her groin , but hard to feel behind her knees and distally . 
They are symmetrical . 
Informally , ABI test was not done today because she has several weeping eczematous lesions on her legs , which reflects psoriasis that has been excoriated . 
A brief neurologic exam reveals dysmetria worse on the left than the right . 
We reviewed the echocardiogram today and we wished to confirm with the reading echocardiographer that it is indeed positive . 
Certainly , if she does not indeed have a patent foramen ovale , there is no issue as to what to do about it . 
If she does have one ; however , it seems more likely that her strokes reflect her atherosclerotic vascular disease secondary to her atherosclerotic risk factors and that the bulk of treatment should be directed at modulating those . 
Her hypertension is controlled today . 
Her dyslipidemia is not bad . 
However , the LDL is 7 6 and perhaps there is some added benefit to increasing her simvastatin to 8 0 mg p . o . 
We also note that she has had elevated glucoses in the past , as high as 1 9 1 , as well as an elevated hemoglobin A 1 c up to 6 . 5 . 
It is probably worth having her screen formally to see whether or not she has type 2 diabetes mellitus versus insulin insensitivity only . 
She may benefit from an oral hypoglycemic . 
We recommend . 
We will review the echocardiogram with the reading echocardiographer to ensure that it does indeed show a patent foramen ovale . 
We suggest that she increase her statin from simvastatin 4 0 mg p . o . 
We will leave this to her primary care physician to organize . 
We suggest that she be screened formally for diabetes mellitus type 2 . 
We will see her again as necessary , but for the time being , we have no plans to perform an intervention on this lady . 
The patient was seen and examined by me . 
Placement of leads could not be confirmed at CH . 
Pulse 7 3 and blood pressure 1 2 9 / 8 0 . 
No murmurs on cardiac examination . 
PTT 2 1 and INR 1 . 
Chest x - ray shows no acute changes . 
Patient was sitting on her couch this morning between 9 - 1 0 AM when she began to have L arm numbness . 
She initially thought it was from leaning on her arm but it did not improve when she moved . 
She also noted that it was not in any particular nerve distribution . 
Aside from this deficit , she denies any H / A , LOC , dizziness , blurry vision , facial droop , weakness , or aphasia . 
Her symptoms persisted for about 1 2 hours and then spontaneously resolved . 
Of note , she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke . 
Lives alone and performs her own ADLs . 
PERRL 4 mm & # 2 2 4 ; 2 mm . 
No apparent preference of gaze , nystagmus ( or diplopia ) , or ptosis . 
Palate elevates symmetrically . 
While her deficits appear to have resolved , arguing against stroke , she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke . 
These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA / PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli . 
Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear , her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus . 
Pt reports sudden onset of SOB this AM . 
Not associated with any other symptoms . 
A contractor who was at her home at the time called EMS who took pt to hospital . 
En route she developed nausea and had 1 episode of NBNB emesis . 
Otherwise , she denies CP , cough , fever , chills , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting ( other than the episode in the ambulance ) , change in bowel / bladder habits . 
No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms . 
Of note , she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke . 
Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 9 0 s . 
She also was tachycardic to the 9 0 s with BPs to the 9 0 / 6 0 with one episode of BP to 7 8 systolic . 
She responded well to fluid with 2 L in the ED and improved BPs . 
CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas , no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis , and no evidence of PE . 
CXR was clear . 
Of note , following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2 0 8 7 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis , she was started on Coumadin . 
However , the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma . 
Per the patient , she received 8 U PRBC there . 
She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin . 
During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia . 
An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d / c & # 8 2 1 7 ; d on 8 / 2 6 / 8 7 . 
She was discharged off of anticoagulation . 
Performs all ADLs . 
Dry mucous membranes , no oral / buccal lesions .

Neuro : alert , oriented x 3 . 
CN 2 - 1 2 intact except for slight left facial droop and mild slurring of speech . 
Pt reports sudden onset of SOB at rest this AM . 
CT PE negative however given history of possible iliac vein thrombosis , highly concerning in setting of being off of anticoagulation in the setting of RP and Rectus sheath hematomas . 
However , given her rapid recovery in the ED with nebs and oxygen and subsequent weaning to room air , there is lower concern for a PE . 
History of iliac vein thrombosis is unclear and not fully imaged on CT today . 
Currently no nausea , benign exam , nl WBC .

The patient was thought to have acute closed angle glaucoma caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy . 
Iron studies , B 1 2 , folate WNL . 
No rebound or guarding . 
Positive bowel sounds . 
Negative for ischemia . 
Glaucoma . 
Likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy . 
If it does not trend down , the patient may need surgery in the AM . 
Of these , I believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely . 
However , I believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes . 
I will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow ( weekend day ) , but I believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future . 
I will give ASA , B blocker and ACE . 
I will not give heparin given that her TIMI score is only 1 .

We will recheck glucose , hemoglobin A 1 c , UA , and microalbuminuria and see how she is doing today . 
Elevated cholesterol . 
Her cholesterol was nowhere near our target of 1 0 0 . 
She is on an increased Lipitor . 
We will check cholesterol , see how she is doing at this point , and an OT , PT to make sure she is tolerating the medication . 
Hypertension . 
All of her symptoms today are most likely due to her hypertension . 
I explained at great length that the reason for all of her symptoms is the fact she stopped taking her medication . 
She seemed surprised that it would have such an immediate and strong effect and I explained to her that it does . 
She has to take her medication every day . 
I told her she had to leave the Carolyn Huntington right now , go immediately to the drugstore to pick up the medication and she said she would do that . 
I also asked her to return next week so we can recheck her blood pressure and make sure it is controlled . 
Health maintenance . 
I will schedule her for a mammogram . 
Colonic adenoma from 1 1 / 2 0 7 6 . 
She will need follow - up colonoscopy every three years per GI . 
The oropharynx was pink without exudate . 
The neck was supple with out adenopathy . 
LUNG - clear bilaterally , without rhonci , wheeze or rales , Normal excursion was noted . 
Cor - heart rate was normal , rhythm was regular . 
Skin - no abnormal lesions noted . 
It would be helpful to know whether cramps came from hctz or amilodipine . 
CHIEF COMPLAINT : Right leg pain and difficulty walking . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Ms . Wilhelm is a 6 8 - year - old right - handed female who has had a three - week history of having right leg pain and difficulty walking . 
She states that her pain started about three weeks ago when she was bending and picking up a pot . 
She states she had a pain in her back that radiated around her right side down her groin into her medial leg , not past the knee . 
She states that it went away at that time . 
The next day she felt worsened and had difficulty working and saw her physician . 
An MRI was ordered . 
Since then , she feels about 6 0 - 7 5 percent better . 
She states that her pain is constant and describes it as a sharp pain . 
She does state she feels weak and her knee would buckle . 
She does not have any numbness or tingling . 
She states she uses a walker to get to her bathroom , however , otherwise stays in the recliner . 
Her symptoms are increased with lying down and standing and decreased with sitting . 
Therapeutically , she has not received any physical therapy or occupational therapy . 
She is currently taking Darvocet , however , less frequently , and Celebrex for arthritis . 
Diagnostically , she has had an MRI scan in April 2 0 9 2 that showed multi - level spinal stenosis , most prominent at L 3 / L 4 , especially on the right side , secondary to facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum infolding , as well as possibly a mild disk bulge . 
Her mammogram was done in 2 0 9 1 which was okay . 
She has not had a bone mineral density at this time . 
MEDICATIONS : Currently , the medication she is on is Celebrex , Hyzaar for her blood pressure , and Darvocet for her pain . 
ALLERGIES : She states that taking Tylenol With Codeine gives her toes a burning sensation , and ibuprofen causes tinnitus .

On musculoskeletal examination of lumbar spine , flexion was within normal limits . 
Extension she had her type of pain at about 1 0 - 2 0 degrees . 
Side - bending was unremarkable . 
On hip examination she had some decreased internal rotation on the right when compared to the left . 
Straight leg raise bilaterally was negative , however , supine , slight guarding on the right . 
Femoral stretch was positive on the right but not on the left . 
On neurological examination , as far as motor examination , there is some slight decrease , half a grade , quadriceps and hip flexors ; however , this was functional ; otherwise unremarkable on the right or the left . 
Her reflexes were 2 plus in the achilles . 
Babinskis were downgoing , 1 plus at the patella on the right , and 2 plus on the left . 
Sensory examination slightly decreased at L 3 on the right ; however , normal throughout ; otherwise , gait was antalgic on the right and she did not want to bear weight . 
Right L 3 acute radiculopathy secondary to herniated disk and facet arthropathy . 
Functional limitations secondary to pain , causing her functional weakness . 
Transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L 3 and L 4 on the right . 
Physical therapy after her injection . 
Continue her medications of Darvocet and Celebrex . 
Keep her out of work until she is able to receive the injection , as well as continue with her physical therapy to improve her strength , given her acute radiculopathy . 
The patient was seen and examined with Dr . Xayasane , who agrees with the plan above . 
Note of Dr . Ellis reviewed , findings confirmed . 
Available electronic notes reviewed , X - rays reviewed , labs reviewed . 
Nonsmoker . 
History of hypertension treated with Hyzaar . 
Current illness began 5 - 6 months ago with fatigue , dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4 - 5 steps in a stairwell . 
She finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue . 
She has had a cough that initially produced yellowish , " slimy " sputum , but more recently has been dry . 
She notes occasional wheezing . 
She also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5 - 6 months that she attributed to " arthritis " . 
No polyuria , but has noted nocturia X 2 for the past 5 - 6 months . 
During the same period of time , has noted very dry mouth . 
No abdominal pain , but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks . 
Appetite diminished and she lost about 3 0 pounds . 
She noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her PCP " cut into " recently . 
She has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to " get larger " . 
She experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours , prompting her to come to the ER . 
No associated diaphoresis , nausea . 
Pain somewhat better with sitting up . 
Of note , she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years . 
BP 1 5 8 / 7 9 , Pulse 8 0 , regular ; O 2 sat 9 8 % on room air . 
Afebrile . 
Skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface , similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4 th / 5 th toe . 
No other rashes . 
No nasal findings , no facial skin findings ( specifically , no lupus pernio ) . 
Dry mucous membranes . 
Neck : small , soft , mobile 0 . 5 cm node left anterior cervical chain . 
Cardiac : No JVD . 
Regular rhythm . 
III / VI ( I do not feel a thrill ) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium , but especially prominent at the RUSB with radiation to the clavicles , neck . 
Also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid - back ( ? same murmur ) . 
The murmur intensifies when she stands . 
No gallops . 
No rub . 
Abdomen soft and nontender . 
No spleen tip . 
Liver edge not palpable . 
A CXR from 5 / 2 0 9 7 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy , mediastinal adenopathy , and interstitial infiltrates . 
Dyspnea on exertion , progressive . 
Interstitial lung disease . 
Bilateral hilar adenopathy 4 . 
Weight loss 5 . 
Prominent systolic murmur ( s ? ) . 
Changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . 
There was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2 0 8 5 , but obviously , need more recent data . 
Minimally elevated troponins . 
Uncertain significance . 
Anemia , mildly microcytic . 
Elevated LDH . 
Renal insufficiency , likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia . 
History of hypertension . 
She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis , but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission . 
The lung findings , systemic symptoms , hypercalcemia , anemia , abnormal serum ACE level are all suggestive of this diagnosis . 
Her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion . 
She should not receive diuretics at present . 
Long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment . 
I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia , but we need definitive diagnosis first . 
The cardiac murmur is impressive , but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease . 
We need echocardiogram to better define valvular function . 
The minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point . 
Appreciate Cardiology input on this finding . 
Stop HCTZ , avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted . 
IV normal saline . 
May need rates in the 1 5 0 - 2 0 0 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely , but she has had this for some time , so can be conservative with fluids approach . 
Agree with check PTH , vitamin D levels . 
Follow lytes , creatinine , calcium , Hct . 
Agree with check echocardiogram . 
We should ask the Pulmonary Service to see her in consultation . 
Bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis . 
At that time , the patient noted that 3 - 4 mo PTA she had experienced worsening fatigue and dry mouth , as well as poor oral intake with associated 3 0 lb weight loss . 
In early May , she presented to the walk - in clinic with these complaints and a CXR showed increased interstitial markings and mediastinal lymphadenopathy subsequently confirmed by CT . A PET CT showed FDG avidity in multiple enlarged thoracic and axillary nodes . 
The patient was seen at the lymphoma center by Dr . Utter , and concern was raised for multiple processes including sarcoid , lupus - like syndromes , Castleman ' s , and indolent lymphoma . 
Labs drawn at different times in recent past were notable for a Ca of 1 1 . 8 with Alb of 3 . 5 , a mild tranaminitis in the 4 0 s , LDH of 3 5 4 , ACE of 6 8 , normal TSH , HCT of 3 0 . 2 , ESR of 8 5 , SPEP with diffuse gamma globulin increase , positive ANA at 1 : 2 5 6 0 with nuclear pore staining ( highly specific for biliary cirrhosis ) , elevated B 2 MG at 1 7 . 5 , and elevated kappa and lambda free light chains at 6 6 and 8 3 . 5 , respectively and negative HIV . 
Axillary lymph node biopsy 6 / 0 8 / 9 7 revealed non - specific follicular hyperplasia , though to be consistent with a reactive process . 
Oncology was consulted , and a lymphoma work - up was pursued ; flow cytometry revealed polyclonal CD 1 9 + B cells , CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells , with no evidence for a monoclonal B or unusual T cell population . 
Repeat CT examination of the chest revealed no change in the bilateral axillary , mediastinal , and hilar lymphadenopathy and offered no further clues to diagnostic possibilities . 
The patient underwent pulmonary function testing , which showed a reduction in the FEV 1 , FVC , and FEV 1 / FVC ratio ; total lung capacity and subdivisions were normal , resistance and specific conductance were normal , and single breath diffusion capacity was reduced . 
On 7 / 1 9 / 9 7 , a bronchoscopy was attempted , but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure , and it was not performed . 
Thoracic surgery was consulted and recommended that the patient be evaluated in the outpatient setting for biopsy under general anesthesia . 
Fungal antibodies were sent , and a trial of steroids was not attempted during hospitalization . 
She notes continued weight loss of 1 5 lbs since leaving the hospital , tolerating little more than 1 - 2 cans of Ensure / day per her family . 
She further denies N / V , diarrhea , fever / chills / dizziness or recent infection . 
Of note , she has been drinking little , but urinating 9 - 1 0 times a day , clear urine with large volumes . 
She has not had a bowel movement for several days . 
She has continued her medications as instructed at the time of discharge . 
In addition , her family notes a dramatic change in her mood and activity level since prior to hospitalization . 
She used to be very active , working nearly every day and keeping up her household . 
She now spends most of her day in bed sleeping , relying on her children for help and awakening early in the AM unintentionally . 
She has felt too tired to pursue her usual nightly bingo game . 
She denies suicidal ideation , saying she has her four grandchildren to liver for . 
ED COURSE : At the ED , the patient was afebrile , HR 5 9 , BP 1 3 6 / 6 1 , RR 1 6 , O 2 Sat 9 5 % . 
She was given IVF and labs were drawn . 
Originally from Tajikistan . 
Widowed for 4 2 years , has worked at MEDIQUIK for 4 0 years as a nurse . 
FH : DM in children . 
Hypercalcemia ( as in vitamin D excess secondary to sarcoid ) can cause polyuria via osmotic diuresis , with dehydration , anorexia , constipation , and PUD , fatigue and depression . 
Expect Ca to be high , Phos to be low . 
THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY . 
PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE . 
She had an IVC filter placed and was started on anticoagulation and discharged again to Harton Center on 1 2 / 1 and now presents with nausea , vomiting , and several days of poor PO intake . 
This is actually her fifth admission to MEDIQUIK this year & # 8 2 1 1 ; first in June when she was diagnosed with HOCM and then in July when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis . 
She says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery ( although her July admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite ) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery . 
The nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day . 
The nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis . 
She has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days . 
She denies fevers , chills , headaches , cough , abdominal pain , or change in the character of her colostomy output . 
Her abdomen was non - tender and minimally distended . 
CT of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified . 
She was seen by surgery and an NGT was placed . 
She was given 2 L of IVF and morphine 2 mg IV x 2 . 
ROS As above , otherwise reports baseline blurry vision ( has been told of cataracts in the past ) . 
Denies SOB , cough , CP , chest pressure , orthopnea , palpitations . 
Foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness . 
SOCIAL HISTORY Originally from . 
Widowed 4 2 years , 4 children , 4 grandchildren . 
Works in TLC as a nurse . 
No tobacco / alcohol / drugs . 
There is linear atelectasis of the lung bases . 
HEPATOBILIARY : No focal hepatic lesions . 
No biliary ductal dilatation . 
There are stable findings of porcelain gallbladder . 
SPLEEN : No splenomegaly . 
PANCREAS : No focal masses or ductal dilatation . 
ADRENALS : No adrenal nodules . 
KIDNEYS / URETERS : No hydronephrosis , stones , or solid mass lesions . 
Two left renal exophytic lesions are identified , stable in size compared with the prior examination and consistent with renal cysts . 
PELVIC ORGANS / BLADDER : There is a Foley catheter in place . 
There is a fibroid uterus . 
PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM : No free air is seen . 
There is trace free fluid . 
LYMPH NODES : No lymphadenopathy . 
VESSELS : There are scattered vascular calcifications . 
An IVC filter is in place . 
GI TRACT : There is diffuse dilation of the proximal and mid small bowel with multiple air fluid levels . 
There are loops of nondilated distal small bowel and the colon is not dilated . 
There is diverticulosis . 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES : Unremarkable . 
IMPRESSION : Findings concerning for distal small bowel obstruction though no discrete transition point is identified . 
Alternately , this could reflect ileus . 
Close clinical follow up advised . 
Lactate was within normal limits so small bowel ischemia unlikely . 
Also abdominal exam remains benign at this time . 
Appreciate surgery input NGT to low wall suction NPO except meds for bowel rest Serial abdominal exams Check colostomy output guaiac Acute renal failure : Her creatinine was up from a baseline of 1 . 0 to 2 . 1 on admission . 
With IVF hydration in the ED it has already started to come down to 1 . 8 so it was likely pre - renal in the setting of poor intake and vomiting . 
Continue IVF while NPO Will trend Cr and pursue further ARF work - up if not down on AM labs Anemia : Baseline hematocrit in low 3 0 s , last 3 2 . 6 prior to discharge on 1 1 / 3 0 . 
She does not appear to have an active source of bleeding and her bilirubin is within normal limits so she is unlikely to be hemolyzing . 
She likely either has iron - deficiency anemia ( although she has been taking iron supplements ) or anemia of chronic disease & # 8 2 1 1 ; or a combination thereof . 
Her RDW is only mildly elevated which likely indicates inappropriately low hematopoiesis . 
Transfuse 1 U PRBCs Check colostomy guaiac Check iron studies , reticulocyte count Elevated INR / hypercoagulability : She is baseline hypercoagulable with lupus anticoagulant and has had the recent large DVT / PE s / p IVC filter placement . 
She comes in with an elevated INR and is likely supratherapeutic on her coumadin . 
She does not need to be reversed as she does not seem to be actively bleeding . 
Of note , pt had recent admission to MEDIQUIK ( 6 / 2 9 - 7 / 0 5 ) at which time she presented with similar complaints of fatigue / lethargy and routine CBC demonstrated an elevated WBC ( 1 5 ) and low Hct ( 2 3 ) . 
She was ultimately found to have an Enterococcus bacteremia and intra - abdominal abscess that grew out E . coli . 
She underwent IR drainage of the abdominal collection and completed a course of Vanc / CTX . 
Outpatient f / u abd CT ( 7 / 1 8 ) showed near complete resolution of the intra - abdominal collection . 
Since that time , however , pt & # 8 2 1 7 ; s sons report increasing lethargy at her nursing facility . 
Patient has no complaints . 
Specifically , she denies fatigue , chest pain , shortness of breath , dizziness , motor weakness and fevers and chills . 
However , given concern on the part of her sons , pt was taken to the MEDIQUIK ED . 
In the MEDIQUIK ED , she was afebrile with HR 7 0 , BP 1 5 0 / 7 4 , RR 2 4 , and Sa 0 2 1 0 0 % RA . 
She denies EtOH , tobacco , and illicit drugs . 
Increased interstitial markings may represent worsened mild pulmonary edema or interstitial infection . 
Abd CT ( 7 / 1 8 / 9 8 ) : Near complete resolution of previously seen left lower quadrant fluid collection . 
Stable small cystic lesions in pancreas which likely represent side branch IPMN . 
Abd CT ( 6 / 3 0 / 9 8 ) : New 4 . 8 x 4 . 0 cm thick walled fluid collection in the LLQ which contains a small amount of gas . 
This would be amenable to percutaneous drainage . 
Small bilateral pleural effusions , decreased in size . 
Bilateral benign renal cysts . 
Gallbladder wall calcifications . 
A / P : 7 4 F with sarcoidosis , HTN , CHF , HOCM , PE s / p IVC filter now on coumadin , PVD s / p L BKA , and DM who presents from her rehab facility with failure to thrive and increasing lethargy for several weeks . 
Failure to thrive / lethargy : The etiology of this pt & # 8 2 1 7 ; s lethargy is unclear . 
It is notable , however , that her presentation on this admission is very similar to her presentation in July at which time she was found to be bacteremic with an additional intra - abdominal bacterial collection . 
At present , there is no clear source of infection , although her urinalysis is suspicious for a UTI . 
Elevated WBC in someone on chronic steroids is concerning for infection , but pt is hemodynamically stable and afebrile . 
In addition to bacteremia , UTI and re - accumulation of an intra - abdominal collection , other possible causes of her lethargy include toxic / metabolic causes ( such as uremia ) , anemia , or depression . 
Anemia & # 8 2 1 1 ; Source of anemia has been unclear in the past . 
During last admission , pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy . 
GI at that time had deferred colonoscopy . 
It is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive . 
Elevated INR & # 8 2 1 1 ; pt has a supratherapeutic INR . 
Given that pt is near discharge Hct from previous admission , do not feel that she is actively bleeding . 
As such , do not feel the need to actively reverse her . 
Renal insufficiency & # 8 2 1 1 ; Cr 1 . 5 8 today ( baseline 1 . 2 ) . 
HEENT - normocephalic , atraumatic . 
Abdomen soft , non - tender , positive bowel sounds . 
Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema . 
Discharged in stable condition . 
No calf tenderness . 
Negative Homan ' s sign . 
Nonfocal . 
SMA - 7 notable for a bicarb of 1 9 . 
He has had some epigastric pain . 
INR is 1 . 
However , BP was reportedly as high as 1 9 0 / 1 0 6 ( and wife says she & # 8 2 1 7 ; s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks ) , and blood glucose 4 0 0 s . 
I see no LMR note about the visit , but am told that he was given some medication for his BP , given some insulin and a Rx for insulin , and instructed to see his PCP the next day , and discharged . 
Friday he did see his PCP , who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead , and told him to return to the ED b / c he still had a terrible HA , so he came back to the EDUCARE - PULLMAN ED tonight . 
He was given caffeine , ibuprofen , Tylenol , and compazine , reported that his HA was gone . 
However , a staff physician in the ED on exam noted a wide based gait . 
An MRI was originally ordered , but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI . 
Neurology is now consulted . to comment on his gait and other sx . 
Patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline , and has been as it is for years ; they have noticed no change and have no complaints . 
He is very unpleasant and un - forthcoming about his history , slow to cooperate w / exam ; says he wants to go home , resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone . 
Normal affect . 
Speech is fluent with intact comprehension and repetition , no paraphasic errors . 
Concentration and attention intact . 
Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally ; face , tongue and palate are symmetric ; SCM and traps 5 / 5 . 
Motor : Normal bulk and tone ; no tremor , rigidity , or bradykinesia . 
No pronator drift . 
Finger tapping normal . 
Reflexes : absent throughout . 
Cerebellar : Finger - nose - finger , rapid alternating movements , heel - knee - shin normal and symmetric b / l . 
Gait : Slightly wide based . 
Normal arm swing , normal speed . 
Able to walk on toes and heels . 
Some difficulty w / tandem walk . 
Negative Romberg . 
Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait , which does appear a bit wide - based , but he and wife confirm that this is chronic , and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems . 
Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN , which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA , and his uncontrolled DM , of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education . 
In any case , I find no acute neurological issues . 
Thanks for this interesting consult . 
Case / plan discussed w / KEKELA neurology attending by phone , Dr . Ivan Guy . 
Call w / questions 8 6 3 8 3 . 
He is doing much better today . 
Repeat blood pressure is 1 7 4 / 8 0 . 
No nystagmus . 
Follows commands , appropriate . 
The patient is unable to stand without assistance . 
This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other , without an overall predominance of one side . 
Several weeks ago , her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping . 
Around this time , the pain spread up her legs to above her knees . 
She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen ( she is unable to see her feet due to blindness ) . 
Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission , when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom . 
A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called . 
In the ED , she was found to have BP elevated to 1 9 0 , Cr elevated to 2 . 8 , FSG down to 5 1 , and R - sided hydronephrosis . 
Labetolol / diltiazem were given for HTN with good response , IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr , and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI . 
She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2 nd - 4 th digits . 
ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation ( 1 BM / 2 days ) . 
She denies fever / chills / sweats , recent weight loss , fatigue , hypoglycemic episodes , cough / rhinorrhea / sore throat , SOB , orthpnea , CP , palpitations , abdominal pain , diarrhea , dysuria , polyuria / polydipsia . 
She is widowed with closest family being a cousin in Alaska . 
She has been able to meet her needs of daily living independently . 
FH : Mother with fatal MI at 6 5 , no family h / o rheumatic disease or cancer . 
She was found to have exquisitely tender joints up to and including her knees with visible synovial effusions of her knees bilaterally . 
Aspiration of one of her knees revealed needle - shaped negatively birefringent crystals , diagnostic of gout . 
This is consistent with her elevated uric acid and her elevated markers of inflammation ( ESR / CRP ) . 
Given that she has a long history of symptoms of LE diabetic neuropathy and that she has some diffuse soft tissue tenderness , she may also have some pain from diabetic neuropathy that may declare itself after her gout is treated . 
However , her current inability to walk can be clearly attributed to gout . 
The medial aspect of the right knee was sterilized using iodine swabs x 3 , sterile gloves used in a one - handed sterile lateral approach . 
A 1 8 G needle was inserted into the knee and approximately 2 0 cc of opaque , yellow fluid was withdrawn . 
A slide was prepared and examined under the microscope by myself , Dr . Yau , and Dr . Woodard . 
Abundant intracellular and extracellular needle - shapped negatively birefringent crystals were observed . 
Synovial fluid sample was also submitted for culture , Gram stain , cell count , and crystal analysis . 
Agree with excellent note above . 
Patient seen with Dr . Woodard . 
Fingerstick in the field was 1 7 9 . 
Normal plantar flexion able to sit up , and following commands . 
Bicarbonate of 2 2 . 
INR 1 . 1 . 
Please see written chart and nurse ' s note . 
Please see the resident ' s note for further details . 
The patient is asymptomatic . 
The patient has no other complaints . 
Mucous membranes were dry . 
No carotid bruits . 
No rebound or guarding . 
Minimal suprapubic tenderness to palpation . 
G - tube in place . 
No rash or lesions were noted . 
I did not ambulate the patient . 
The patient then had 1 2 - lead EKG performed . 
The patient ' s hematocrit of 3 3 . 2 . 
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response . 
History of a left MCA stroke . 
The patient is interviewed and available records are reviewed . 
In February , she developed left leg weakness on arising one morning . 
There was also some possible ataxia of the left upper extremity with decreased control of both the arm and the leg . 
This seemed to occur for two days in a row and on one occasion , she fell getting out of bed . 
The symptoms resolved before she could be evaluated . 
She attributed the symptoms to not enough air pressure in her air mattress and once this was corrected , she feels that the event has not re - occured . 
The second event was apparently associated with some left facial weakness as well . 
She was seen by Neurology on 0 2 / 1 0 / 4 3 after she was admitted . 
The history includes also lightheadedness and foggy vision per that report . 
Initially MRI of the head showed no acute events but did show a change in the right posterior cerebral artery and a lesion in the left temporal lobe . 
Also , in the record is noted that at the time of the second event , her glucose was very low at around 3 2 and symptoms resolved after treatment with D 5 0 . 
There was also further history that the patient had been seeing a chiropractor for treatment of neck pain in the several months leading up to the event . 
On examination at the time of admission , there were no clear findings . 
MRI was said to show periventricular white matter changes . 
The area of abnormality adjacent to the left lateral ventricle was thought to perhaps represent an old prior small hemorrhage . 
MRA of the brain showed absence of visualization of the right PCA about 1 cm beyond its origin but MRA of the neck showed no significant changes . 
Subsequent echocardiogram showed mild LVH with no evidence of a shunt . 
Currently , the patient is asymptomatic and presents for routine followup . 
It has been unclear what the cause of her symptoms was . 
Some have attributed the symptoms to hypoglycemia and another formulation was that of a thalamic TIA given the changes in the right PCA on MRA . 
Another consideration was dissection from manipulation by the chiropractor . 
There is no clinical history to go with the possible old small hemorrhage . 
The patient also has some shortness of breath but there is no report of chest pain or fever or chills . 
There are no medication allergies reported . 
Not withstanding the above , the patient continues to smoke . 
She uses alcohol occasionally . 
She has a 1 2 th grade education . 
She lives alone and is a widow . 
The patient is overweight . 
Height is 5 foot 3 inches . 
Weight is 2 1 7 pounds .

The patient does move slowly in general , this is probably not reflective of true bradykinesia . 
There is some asymmetry of the shoulders with elevation on the right compared with the left . 
This affects movements of the arms and range of motion of the arms but it appears to be orthopedic in nature and not neurologic . 
There is no focal muscle weakness or atrophy noted .

Homocystine level was elevated at 1 4 , normal zero to ten . 
Recommended treatment included folate , pyridoxine , and B 1 2 . 
Comment . 
I would agree with prior examiners that the symptoms probably do not relate to the position of the bed or air in the air mattress . 
I do not think the symptoms are approximate enough to the chiropractic manipulation to be relevant . 
Symptoms could have related to hypoglycemia or could have been vascular in nature . 
In this regard , the PCA stenosis or occlusion may be relevant . 
It is not immediately clear how to fit in the old hemorrhage . 
She was on aspirin at the time of the event and therefore would be considered an aspirin failure . 
We therefore suggested Plavix 7 5 mg daily . 
We were subsequently called by the pharmacy and informed that she is already on Aggrenox . 
It probably does not matter which medication she chooses ; however , she should be on one or the other and not both . 
For treatment of the homocysteine level elevation , we have added simply multivitamins two daily . 
I am not sure how significant this finding is in relation to the above symptoms . 
She is advised to watch her glucose level and adjust medicines accordingly . 
We have suggested a followup in Neurology in six months .

Of note , had h / o mild rhabdo in 2 0 9 4 in setting of crestor use - - this was noted during CCH hospitalization . 
Gemfibrozil was recommended ( unclear if pt ever took ) , although it was suggested that pt could do trial of pravachol . 
Has appt already with nutritionist at GH later this month . 
About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole , presumably for H . pylori eradication ( not confirmed ) ; she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling . 
The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone . 
She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery . 
Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat ; on further questioning , she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well . 
No fevers , chills , night sweats , nausea , vomiting , chest pain , palpitations , headache , lightheadedness , vertigo , rash or new joint pain ; no recent travel .

ROS : Pertinent positives and negatives above . 
No alcohol , tobacco or drug use . 
Born in Peru , last visit about one year ago . 
The presence of thrush raises suspicion for esophageal candidiasis , though she does not report odynophagia . 
Mechanical obstruction should be ruled out . 
The presence of mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia is likely attributable to the fact that she abruptly discontinued exogenous corticosteroids after a several week course ; she is hemodynamically stable . 
Finally , there is little here to suggest acute coronary syndrome , though she falls into a subgroup of patients more likely to present with minimal symptoms . 
ECG warrants following . 
Diabetes is poorly controlled and may require initiation of insulin therapy ; though sugars here may have been confounded by the dose of steroids given in ED . 
CV : CR monitor overnight ; cycle ECG and cardiac biomarkers ; aspirin , continue beta blocker Pulm : No issues ; albuterol prn GI : Upper endoscopy tentatively planned for the morning ; NPO after midnight ; continue home ppi Endocrine : Sliding scale insulin , metformin ; consider diabetes education , and discuss with PCP whether initiation of insulin is warranted .

I have examined the patient and discussed with the Nurse Practitioner the patient ' s care and agree with the plan . 
The pt says the dizziness was worsened when he stood up to walk around ; noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving . 
The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down . 
He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated . 
He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable , then he stopped . 
He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca - cola beverages . 
During these 2 weeks of dizziness , Mr . Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3 - 4 days of his life , saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious . 
He came to this conclusion b / c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days ; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication . 
Mr . Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like & # 8 2 2 0 ; lightheadness . & # 8 2 2 1 ; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol - 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms . 
Mr . Ishida says he & # 8 2 1 7 ; s never experienced any dizziness before , and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed . 
Mr . Ishida also described an increased pressure in his head , saying , & # 8 2 2 0 ; it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode . & # 8 2 2 1 ; Pt denies head trauma / falls , syncope , intoxication ( from drugs or ETOH ) , or CP .

His wife died 1 0 years ago of ovarian cancer and dearly misses her . 
Diet - Mr . Ishidas describes his diet as & # 8 2 2 0 ; not as good as it should be . & # 8 2 2 1 ; He said he generally eats what he wants , eats out a lot and says he can eat a lot of & # 8 2 2 0 ; junk food . & # 8 2 2 1 ; He also said the only time he eats & # 8 2 2 0 ; well & # 8 2 2 1 ; is when he eat at his son & # 8 2 1 7 ; s or daughter & # 8 2 1 7 ; s house . 
Pt doesn & # 8 2 1 7 ; t feel he needs to cut back . 
Drugs - According to the pt he has used cocaine and crack as recent 5 - 6 years ago . 
Sexual Hx - Mr . Ishidas is not currently sexually active . 
He looks well and jovial aside from his labored breathing . 
Normal percussion w / no change in fremitus . 
Ronchi and wheezes bilaterally . 
No egophony or pectoriloquy . 
Normal gait . 
Skin & # 8 2 1 1 ; psoriatic lesions on elbows and thorax ( anterior and posterior ) . 
Head CT : No acute intracranial hemorrhage , mass lesion or territorial infarction identified . 
Chronic infarctions of the pons and right frontal operculum , unchanged . 
Mr . Ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated . 
He had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of Coca - cola over several days . 
This in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea , his diuretic medication , and possible osmotic diuresis ( increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic ) could have shifted him into hypovolemia . 
Thus Mr . Ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his BUN / Cr ratio to be elevated , indicating a prerenal process . 
Although BUN / Cr ratio is not & gt ; 2 0 , we can still assume that he has prerenal ARF considering his use of diuretics and h / o CKD which can decrease the sensitivity of BUN / Cr rations and FENa for assessing etiologies of renal failure . 
Mr . Ishida additionally uses NSAIDs ( e . g . 
Naproxen ) , an ARB and an ACEI , all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal ARF . 
Intrinsic ARF is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs ( e . g . 
Conversely , he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h / o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy . 
Lastly , Mr . Ishida my have a postrenal ARF etiology considering his h / o BPH which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys . 
Mr . Ishida & # 8 2 1 7 ; s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by ARF . 
Additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication , brain hemorrhagic , brain tumor , etc . 
If enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal ARF due to an enlarged prostate . 
Thus the patient should be assessed by Urology of possible partial prostatectomy . 
The paramedics and police were called the scene . 
The police were able to force open the door of the home . 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus . 
The pupils are 2 mm .

She is being dialyzed via a right brachiocephalic fistula that was created in Nov 2 0 7 5 . 
The patient is a very poor historian and the subsequent information has been collected from the medical record . 
While the fistula is beng used successfully for dialysis , it has undergone aneurysmal dilatation and the patient has also developed non - healing areas over the fistula at points of access . 
There is note made in the chart that the patient has had difficulty with recurrent outflow stenosis and for this she seems to have undergone angioplasty at Brooks Hospital ( no record in LMR ) recently . 
The patient does not have any complaints . 
Per the record she may also have outflow stenosis . 
Will discuss with Dr . Andersen .

Shortly after taking the first tablet , she developed itching in the hands , face , and legs and as well as hives . 
She denied any shortness of breath , difficulty breathing or loss of consciousness . 
She called the emergency room and was instructed to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic reaction . 
So now , she is here for follow up from that . 
She said shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and itchiness have improved very quickly . 
She is still complaining of purulent drainage around her groin . 
She gets hives from both . 
Her bilateral groins looks red , swollen tender with some serous as well as some purulent drainage . 
There is no fluctuance that I could feel . 
Given the recent allergy to Keflex , we will obviously need to take a different antibiotic . 
She has been on dicloxacillin in the past with good result . 
Despite the 1 5 % cross allergy of dicloxacillin compared to Keflex , I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for now . 
If this does not work , I think one should consider clindamycin for treatment . 
I will go ahead and give her 1 4 days worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M . D . 
I also gave her 6 0 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her prescription of Glucotrol XL 2 . 5 mg a day . 
She should see her PCP in two weeks .

Continues to describe increased activity level . 
Nora saw Dr . Iyer on 3 / 0 2 / 8 1 who felt that given the broad extent of the left axillary involvement , she would require extensive debridement and excision , and likely flap rotation coverage . 
He , therefore , referred her to plastic surgery . 
Feels that she needs abx again bc of increasing drainage and erythema . 
Cipro has been most helpful recently .

Will need to discuss further at next visit and once again review crucial nature of smoking cessation for her . 
Nora states that she understands risks but feels that exam would be impossible given pain . 
Nora still feels that examine would be impossible given HS . 
Will continue to discuss and work to get treatment for her HS . 
Expressed my concern regarding continual deferral of mammogram and risk for cancer .

Counsel re : weight loss . 
This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program . 
He also reports severe DoE , with a maximal walking distance of 5 - 6 steps , as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria , and rectal incontinence . 
Since the recent weight gain , he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins . 
He denies CP , diarrhea , HA , fever , chills , cough . 
His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints ; however , the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those . 
He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago . 
Because of his increasing SOB , he called EMS , who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa 0 2 of 7 3 % on RA . 
ED Course : On arrival in the ED , his VS were : T 9 8 , BP 1 0 8 / 6 5 , RR 2 4 , HR 1 0 0 , O 2 Sa 9 2 % on 4 L 0 2 . 
He received one dose of lasix 8 0 mg iv , urine output unrecorded . 
He was transferred to Internal Medicine for further management . 
Social Hx : Married , two children , used to work as die setter for 2 5 years , has not worked for last 5 years . 
Quite smoking 6 years ago , total ca . 
Denies EtOH , illicit drugs . 
Pulmonary vascular redistribution cannot be excluded on this semi upright film . 
CXR ( pa / lat ) : Mild pulmonary congestion with cardiomegaly . 
Small right pleural effusion . 
Stable elevated right hemidiaphragm . 
SOB : Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare ( due to lasix discontinuation , BNP 1 3 2 6 ) and COPD ( PFT in 2 1 2 0 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit ) . 
CXR showing cardiomegaly and right - sided pleural effusion , consistent with CHF . 
Started on oxygen , lasix , combivent nebs . 
Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE . 
In the absence of CP , PE unlikely . 
Cardiac enzymes negative . 
CHF : Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction . 
Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI . 
Reinitiated Lasix . 
HTN : patient here normotensive . 
Currently taking verapamil , however , 1 . degree heart block . 
Will consider switching to ACEI . 
OSA : Patient on home oxygen . 
Will suggest CPAP / BiPAP Diabetes : Currently taking Glybyride , will obtain HBA 1 c here , keep on RISS while inpatient . 
Abdominal discomfort / bloating : Most likely related to recent weight gain of 3 0 lbs , diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing . 
Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide . 
Discussed possibility of gastric bypass , patient rejects . 
Rectal incontinence : Might be related to diabetic neuropathy . 
Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity . 
Groin erythema : Suggestive of fungal infection . 
Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult . 
RLE ulcer : Granulating leg ulcer , Will continue topical care . 
The patient has had innumerable episodes of ulceration , which heal with TubiGrip and Profore dressings ultimately to break down again . 
The patient has been discharged from the TNA and as I understand it the question is put to me today is whether the patient is a candidate for a Lymphapress . 
The patient has had chronic bilateral lower extremity discoloration and swelling for over ten years . 
He has never worn compression stockings . 
He has had multiple episodes of recurrent ulcers . 
To the best of his knowledge he has never had phlebitis but has had Unna boots in the past . 
The patient denies any prolonged hospitalization , long bone fractures or prior history of DVT . 
There is no family history of varicose veins or DVT . 
He has no personal history of cancer or trauma . 
He has not been involved in any prolonged travel , does not take any hormone medication and is unemployed . 
The patient ' s past medical history is notable for coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , sleep apnea , peripheral neuropathy , morbid obesity , hypertension and pulmonary hypertension . 
His current medications include lisinopril , verapamil , metformin , furosemide , aspirin , vitamin C , Spiriva and Advair . 
The patient denies any family history of cancer , thrombocytosis , thrombocytopenia or bleeding . 
The patient was raised in Dothan and lives in Galion . 
He does not work , denies alcohol abuse and quit tobacco eight years ago . 
His review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant pain , dyspnea , glasses , diabetes and hyperlipidemia . 
On physical exam he is a morbidly obese gentleman with intertriginous rashes question fungal origin in the axilla on the right . 
He has distant breath sounds with fine expiratory wheezes . 
He has some tenderness in the right upper quadrant to palpation . 
He has a huge protuberant abdomen . 
There is no tenderness in the right upper quadrant . 
He has bounding carotid , brachial and radial pulses . 
His femoral pulses are not palpable likely due to his body habitus . 
On the left his dorsalis pedis is 1 + and on the right his posterior tibial was 2 + . 
He has huge legs with evidence of stasis dermatitis and lipodermatosclerosis , which is greater on the left than the right . 
He has prominent varices on his right thigh near the takeoff of what appears to be an anterolateral accessory branch . 
He has severe brawny induration , discoloration and superficial ulcers on the right with none on the left . 
The patient seems somewhat reserved but is quite communicative when prompted . 
The results of his noninvasive vascular lab studies showed bilateral greater saphenous vein reflux . 
The reflux is confined to the first accessory saphenous vein in the right leg and the saphenopopliteal junction in the proximal thigh . 
It should be noted that the reflux in the saphenopopliteal junction on the right is 0 , in the anterolateral saphenous vein on the right it is 3 seconds and in the small saphenous vein on the right the reflux is 3 seconds . 
In the deep femoral vein , common femoral and superficial femoral vein there is no reflux . 
In contrast on the left there is reflux at the saphenopopliteal junction of a mere 3 seconds , in the proximal greater saphenous vein 3 seconds , midthigh 3 seconds and distal thigh 3 seconds . 
In the popliteal vein there is no reflux and the small saphenous vein there is 3 seconds . 
Due to the patient ' s size it was difficult to identify perforators . 
In summary , we have a morbidly obese gentleman with mild to moderate reflux on examination and severe stasis dermatitis and discoloration . 
Thus there is a mismatch between the degree of physical findings and objective laboratory data . 
I believe that this is the case primarily because the patient cannot lie flat and often sleeps with his legs in a dependent position . 
Thus he has an ongoing stasis in his legs due to inactivity and dependency . 
This in addition to his morbid obesity , that is a girth of 3 8 5 pounds that presses on his abdomen 2 4 hours a day , seven days a week and compresses the vena cava as well as the lymphatic drainage of his legs . 
All of these factors taken into account contribute to his discoloration , ulceration and lower extremity swelling . 
The solution to this problem is not an easy one . 
With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent . 
Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs , however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device . 
If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long - term benefit . 
I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps . 
I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf . 
I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care , which are important . 
I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling . 
It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth . 
If I can provide any additional information regarding Mr . Uribe , please let me know . 
Patient has had 2 prior admission ( 2 1 2 1 , 2 1 2 2 ) for CHF exacerbations , last admission requiring lasix 8 0 IV TID to diurese 1 - 3 L / day .

Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating , increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion . 
At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet . 
He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound . 
He reports medication compliance except for missing 2 - 3 times over the past several weeks .

From there he was transferred to the HBH ED . 
In the ambulance he received 4 0 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1 L of UOP . 
He received another 4 0 mg IV of lasix and put out 8 0 0 cc .

His wounds have been managed until this time by his podiatrist and his mother ( a former doctor ) has been doing dressing changes at home - initially with silvadene but over the past several days with ? betadine as directed by his podiatrist . 
The pt is a floor covering installer , and has been bearing weight on the R foot since his injury and admits that he has not been compliant wearing a heel boot . 
He has not had fever / chills , nausea / emesis and in general feels well . 
He has not had pain in the foot , but does have a significant neuropathy . 
His podiatrist recommended that he be evaluated by plastic / burn surgery and he presents to burn clinic for further evaluation . 
As you may know , he is a 4 7 - year - old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension , poorly controlled insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus , former tobacco use , morbid obesity , no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease . 
He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr . Phillip Isaac Crosby , at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center . 
This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation . 
Mr . Rivers , as mentioned , denies any history of known coronary artery disease . 
He has had a prior stress test greater than 1 5 years ago , but none recently . 
He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram . 
He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 2 0 years . 
He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps , but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion , unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 4 0 0 pounds . 
He denies any heart failure symptoms , orthopnea , PND , lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently . 
Additionally , he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents . 
He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned , he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer . 
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable . 
Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity . 
Medications include Toprol - XL 1 2 5 mg p . o . 
He is allergic to penicillin for which he develops a rash . 
His social history is remarkable for former tobacco use for many years , though he quit more than three years ago . 
He has no extensive alcohol or illicit drug use history . 
He lives locally with his wife and five children and as mentioned is a floor coverer in ID working at Provo . 
He is followed by Dr . Gilmore at the Helena Hospital for primary care . 
On examination , he is afebrile , heart rate is 9 8 and regular , blood pressure 1 4 8 / 7 8 and respiratory rate is 1 6 breaths per minute in no acute distress . 
He is a well - appearing gentleman in stated age with morbid obesity . 
His jugular venous pressure is difficult to estimate given his habitus . 
He is clear to auscultation bilaterally . 
He has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S 1 , S 2 and no murmur , rub or gallop . 
His abdomen is obese , nontender with positive bowel sounds and no hepatomegalies appreciated . 
His extremities are warm and well perfused with trace edema at the ankles . 
He has good distal pulsations . 
His carotids are 2 + bilaterally without bruit . 
Laboratory values are not available today . 
ECG reveals normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 9 9 . 
He has left anterior fascicular hemiblock with normal R wave progression through his precordium . 
No evidence for LVH or prior infarction . 
He does have low voltage in his limb leads , consistent with his morbid obesity . 
This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity , which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS . 
Most recently , given his hip and orthopedic issues , he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS . 
However , prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago , he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort . 
However , given his multiple risk factors , notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use , he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease . 
As such , I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning . 
If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease , it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week . 
This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery , which is scheduled for 0 1 / 2 0 7 4 . 
With regards to his medication , his blood pressure still is not at goal below 1 3 0 . 
As such , I have increased his Toprol - XL from 1 2 5 mg to 2 0 0 mg p . o . 
This medication should be continued through all surgery . 
Additionally , if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 1 3 0 , I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 2 0 mg p . o . 
Additionally , it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so . 
His last A 1 c was approximately 1 3 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age . 
I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk . 
With regards to his hypertension , he is on multiple agents including Toprol - XL , Aldactone , Avapro and minoxidil . 
Given the multitude of agents , it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism , but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication . 
We could consider in the future , if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary . 
Additionally , if he is found to have coronary artery disease , one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis . 
As mentioned , I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future . 
I will follow back with him in approximately several months ' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care . 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can do to contribute to his ongoing medical care in the interim . 
He has been provided both my e - mail and pager number to contact me if there is anything I can do to assist in his care going forward . 
Thank you . 
Unclear when metformin was discontinued . 
The control has been poor . 
Diabetic complications include neuropathy with numbness in feet and nephropathy with macroalbuminuria . 
He had gastric bypass last night . 
He received Lantus 3 0 . 
He was on D 5 W over night with glucose values over 3 0 0 . . 
He currently is on LR iv drip . 
It is unclear if he is compliant with stated insulin doses . 
Patient reports that 2 days ago , when he clean his feet , he noticed a piece of skin detached from his right outer foot . 
He removed the skin and cleaned the wound with alcohol swab and dressed with bind aid . 
He did not note any injury to his foot , did not find any foreign object in his shoes . 
The right foot became warmer and more painful . 
He however denies any chills , fever , shaking or diaphoresis . 
He has been diagnosed with DM for more than 2 0 years , was on insulin and had constant high blood glucose ( & gt ; 6 0 0 ) most of the time before the gastric bypass surgery . 
He has neuropathy for more than 1 0 years . 
He had laparoscopic Roux - en - Y on 0 6 / 0 8 / 2 0 7 4 . 
His weight lost from 4 3 5 lbs before the Sx to 2 7 5 lbs . 
He is no longer on insulin . 
Current hypoglycemic regimen includes metformin 8 5 0 mg daily . 
Last A 1 C was less than 7 . 
He reports dry cough and he attributes to lisinopril . 
In ED , he was given morphine for pain and vancomycin iv for infection . 
Blood culture sent before given antibiotics . 
Oriented to person , place and time . 
Mood normal and appropriate to situation . 
Thyroid is palpable with normal size and consistency . 
Abdomen : Abdomen soft , nontender , bowel sounds present , no palpable masses . 
Neurological Examination : No focal deficit . 
DTR WNL Extremity exam : + Right foot shallow ulcer with right foot erythema , warm and tender . 
WBC is elevated . 
He likely has diabetic foot ulcer and foot cellulitis . 
X - ray dose not suggest osteomyelitis . 
It was worse yesterday . 
Blood pressure was initially 2 4 1 / 9 0 . 
As you know , she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts . 
Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously , but was successfully restored by Dr . Tejeda . 
In 0 2 / 6 1 , we had detected a high - grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance , and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty . 
A subsequent ultrasound study done in 0 4 / 6 1 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic . 
She is not particularly active . 
She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms . 
Recently , however , her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes . 
She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications . 
She is a nonsmoker . 
On examination today , she appeared well and in good spirits . 
Blood pressure was measured at 1 3 0 / 6 0 in the right arm . 
Lower extremity pulses are 2 + at the femoral level bilaterally . 
On the right , there is a strong , easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft , and the foot is warm and well perfused . 
On the left , I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions . 
The left foot is slightly cooler than the right , and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular . 
There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia . 
There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 1 0 0 mmHg . 
This yields an ankle index of nearly 0 . 7 and maybe falsely elevated . 
A follow - up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today . 
The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent . 
As suspected , the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded . 
Ms . Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal . 
At the present time , she does not have any clear - cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia , though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign . 
The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit . 
Conversely , she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated . 
I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be . 
At the present time , however , she appears to have marginal , though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic . 
I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin . 
I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes , rest pain , or ulceration . 
At a minimum , I will see her back in two months for reexamination , but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation . 
If her collateralization can remain stable , it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient . 
Thank you again for allowing us to participate in her care . 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance . 
She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm . 
Postoperatively , she did well , although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving . 
She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm . 
According to the patient , this was present early during her hospitalization , but because of other issues , it was not paid very much attention . 
She denies any significant pain in the leg . 
The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma , whatsoever . 
The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses ; however , she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition . 
She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function . 
The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle . 
The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing . 
She had a followup graft scan today , which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing . 
The ankle index was measured at 0 . 8 8 on the left and 0 . 6 4 on the right . 
Unfortunately , she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery . 
The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function . 
In any case , she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things . 
There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection . 
We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed . 
She has only a very remote history of smoking , smoking not at all after the age of 3 0 . 
In early March , she was undergoing a routine physical . 
At that time , she reported she had some mild weight loss . 
However , she had been trying to lose weight . 
She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough . 
A chest x - ray was obtained , which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass . 
The patient subsequently had a CT scan . 
The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe . 
There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes , but all below 2 cm . 
She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs . 
The patient is referred by her primary care physician , Dr . Jordon for further evaluation . 
The patient has no history of lung . 
She has no history of asthma or allergies . 
She has not had any history of TB or a positive PPD . 
She may have had some mild asbestos exposure when she worked in a publishing company , which had asbestos containing pipes . 
She has no history of malignancy .

She does not drink . 
She has a very remote smoking history in her teens and early 2 0 s . 
Her O 2 saturation is 9 5 % . 
Her blood pressure is 1 3 0 / 7 0 , her pulse is 5 3 . 
Her nares are without discharge . 
Oropharynx with dentures . 
She has no erythema or exudate . 
Neck is supple without adenopathy , thyromegaly , or bruits . 
Her thorax is kyphotic . 
She has normal fremitus and percussion . 
Her lungs are clear . 
Abdomen is soft . 
Extremities have no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema . 
She has residual of vascular surgery in her legs . 
She has slightly diminished peripheral pulses . 
This is likely to be malignant , although a nonmalignant process or inflammatory processes are remotely possible . 
At this point , I am going to refer her for a PET CT scan . 
Her small nodules in her lung fields bilaterally are all sub 5 mm and may not be related to this malignancy . 
She does have modestly enlarged hilar nodes . 
I am going to refer her to Thoracic Surgery for consideration of a mediastinoscopy and potential resection . 
She would likely require cardiac clearance before this would occur . 
She can follow up with me after her surgery if this proves to be an inflammatory lung disorder . 
Otherwise , she will follow up with Oncology . 
If she was deemed not to be an appropriate surgical candidate , either because of metastatic disease or because of comorbidity , she could have this lesion biopsied via a transthoracic needle aspirate .

She sustained an L 1 fracture without surgical intervention , and returned to canada where she presented to the ED on 3 / 9 / 7 6 wiht back pain , L 1 planar fracture with evidence of minimal cord compressionl She was admitted and seen by neurosurgery who felt that there was no acute indication for surgery . 
Since then , she has had continued pain in her back with occasional burning in her feet but no numbness or tingling . 
She would like to undergo surgery at this point because her pain is intolerable . 
She is in contact with a neurosurgeon at this time regarding when to proceed with surgery . 
She is otherwise doing well . 
She does not have this feeling at rest , and states it has been ongoing for the past year . 
She describes some peripheral edema , as well as PND . 
Also c / o left eye tearing and R ear itching . 
Cannot do ETT given resting ECG abnormalities , and will need pharmocologic stress given she cannot walk from back pain . 
However , given only 1 high b . s documented and A 1 C borderline elevated , I have advised her that we can probably control this with diet , exercise , and wt loss . She will see nutrition to help her avoid high carb foods and to lose wt . 
If this fails to control her DM we will start her on Metformin . 
She will need optho eval for this reason as well .

Regarding her shortness of breath , she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl . 
She has also lost some weight ( intentional ) and states that , although she still gets short of breath with exertion , it is noticeably better . 
She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test . 
For her cough , the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram . 
The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well . 
Regarding her arthritis , he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT . 
Her biggest complaint at the moment , though , is her low back pain . 
She was seen in pain clinic for two injections .

She says this is her most limiting symptom . 
She is begging for narcotics . 
Lastly , she has clear stress urinary incontinence , was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring .

Chronic healed naso - orbito - ethmoid fracture . 
CXR - Progression of predominantly bibasilar nodular and interstitial opacities , possibly be due to chronic aspiration . 
Labs were notable for a high WBC with a neutrophilic predominance and a clean urinalysis . 
Given his history of fever , exam , and lab studies , infection is the most likely cause of Mr . Flaherty & # 8 2 1 7 ; s current presentation . 
As you recall he is a 7 1 - year - old gentleman who is status post angioplasty on the left for high - grade stenotic lesions of the distal superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery on the left . 
The patient presents now for further evaluation of his " claudication symptoms " . 
The patient states he has bilateral lower extremity symptoms , there are about equivalent in nature . 
He has very minimal low back pain . 
He states it seems to be getting worse and seems to be associated with some abnormal gait . 
He states on a bad day its about a 9 / 1 0 and even on a good day sometimes it can be as high as 8 - 9 / 1 0 . 
The episodes are almost daily and are brought on by things like walking . 
He can walk less than one block at which point he has lateral calf burning and at times notes some slow shuffling and occasionally falling . 
When he is having severe symptoms he notes his legs to be weak . 
He denies any bowel or bladder abnormalities of late , but has a historic of a chronic UTI secondary to his benign prostatic hypertrophy . 
He has very little back pain associated with his symptomatology . 
He has had no physical therapy to date and no spinal injections . 
He describes his general health as poor , but when specially asked he states it is because he his 7 1 and has a history of hypertension . 
Years ago he stated he was in excellent health . 
His weight is steady at 2 0 0 with no significant weight gain or loss . 
He doesn ' t smoke and drinks socially . 
Quit smoking 3 3 years ago . 
He does not think he will ever be pain free . 
He has difficulty with sleep . 
He has a balance problem and also has benign prostatic hypertrophy leading to chronic urinary tract infection , for this he takes Cardura . 
He has a history of high blood pressure . 
Denies any other cardiovascular abnormality . 
No respiratory malfunction . 
He has had surgery for something " in his colon " he has also had a bypass surgery . 
He is on Plavix and aspirin . 
He is able to toe and heel walk but on the left side his T band seems to be slightly weak . 
Single toe raises show that the right leg is stronger than the left leg . 
He has no tenderness to his PSIS and he has no Waddell signs . 
He has negative Trendelenburg bilaterally . 
Forward flexion allows him to get to the patella . 
Extension is pain free and passive hyperextension does not reproduce the symptoms . 
Motor testing is normal in his lower extremities . 
Sensory is symmetric . 
He has negative straight leg raises . 
He has no palpable pulses . 
He is hairless in his lower extremities . 
He had no clonus or Babinski and a negative Hoffman ' s suggesting that he is not myelopathic despite his " balance abnormality " . 
He is on multiple meds for his hypertension , for his diabetes , and for his gastroesophageal reflux . 
Personal review of his plain films and a CAT scan indicating with , show decent residual lumbar lordosis with a stent noted in his iliac artery on the right . 
CT scan shows lumbosacral facet hypertrophy . 
At this point , impression is of spinal stenosis and degenerative disk disease . 
I have asked him to obtain an MRI and return to see me after that . 
Thanks for the referral . 
Dr . Innis was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work - up and treatment plan . 
Return visit . 
Mr . Olive is a 7 1 y old RHM , with Idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease . 
He was started on Sinemet 2 5 / 1 0 0 mg tid with significant improvement in his balance & gait & rest tremor . 
However there were still periods of shuffling & stumbling especially going down slope . 
He also complained of persistant fatigue in his legs . 
We started him on Amantadine 1 0 0 mg tid during his last visit . 
He did not tolerate it well & complained of dizziness especially when he goes out , even with reduced dose of 1 0 0 mg bid . 
He has discontinued it since then . 
He is tolerating Sinemet well , no hallucinations , on - off phenomenon . 
He does not notice any wearing off of the effect prior to next dose .

Recommend increasing Sinemet to 3 7 . 5 / 1 5 0 mg tid 7 am , 1 2 noon , & 5 pm . 
Wife will give me a call in 2 wks to let me know his progress . 
Follow up in Neurology clinic in 3 mths . 
Patient & family can contact me in interim with any concerns . 
Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this patient . 
He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery , so far as I can tell . 
The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center ( Big Rapids , AC ) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital , and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there . 
The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times , but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all . 
Currently , he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast , and this stops him at about 5 0 yards . 
The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian - type symptoms , walking in a shuffle , tipping forward , and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely . 
His legs are rubbery , and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens . 
It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything . 
At the same time , his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication , and he has known peripheral artery disease . 
Also feels though his hips sometimes are cramping up . 
The patient feels quite disabled by his symptoms , especially as a gentleman who was active and never had physical problems of this nature . 
Again , there is some degree of blurring between the parkinsonian symptoms and his claudication , as to which is truly causing his disability . 
The patient has not improved despite trying the medications . 
MRI at AC starting in 2 1 5 3 has shown apparent central and peripheral atrophy , unchanged . 
Status post vertebrobasilar TIA by report . 
Neuropathy , documented by EMG in 2 1 5 1 with no spinal stenosis by MRI . 
Cervical spondylosis . 
Tracheal tumor resection in 2 1 2 8 performed via a suprasternal incision . 
Hypertension . 
Mild renal artery stenosis documented by arteriography in 2 1 5 3 during one of his peripheral angiograms . 
No coronary artery disease or MI . 
He used to work at GM . 
He lives with his wife , who comes in today with him . 
He has three children . 
Nondrinker . 
He smoked until 3 0 years ago . 
It was also reviewed on the patient questionnaire sheet that the patient brought with him . 
He does claim to have some dyspnea with exertion as well as intermittent indigestion consistent with GERD . 
He has nocturia . 
He wears dentures . 
No significant weight loss or anorexia . 
No visual changes or other neurologic symptoms other than the gait disturbance and neuropathy . 
He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia . 
Otherwise , review of systems is negative in detail . 
Good bowel sounds , no organomegaly , no enlargement of the aorta . 
Below this , no cyanosis or edema ( perhaps trace to 1 + edema ) , and posterior tibial pulses are 1 to 2 + . 
Dorsalis pedis pulses are not easily palpable . 
His strength is normal , and sensory findings are slightly abnormal with diminished sensation in a stocking - glove distribution . 
He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination . 
The toe brachial index drops to 0 . 2 9 on the right side and 0 . 9 1 at 1 minute after exercise . 
I am not sure what to make of these ABIs since it appears that the actual ankle - brachial indices were not measured following exercise . 
There is normal axis and intervals , with no evidence of prior infraction , and perhaps a slight right ventricular conduction delay . 
Currently , complains of symptoms that sound like claudication , predominantly involving the calves on both sides , right slightly ahead of the left , and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA . 
Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest , I suspect he does not have pre - occlusion of the SFA , for example . 
On the other hand , he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated . 
His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 5 0 yards and stops him at that point , and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder , possible Parkinson ' s disease . 
I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined , and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease , and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment . 
As far his peripheral artery disease , it would be extremely helpful to obtain films from AC and / or the CDH , to better define what procedures were actually performed and where stents were placed . 
Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention , it is likely he will need another angiographic study ( or MRA / CTA ) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease . 
Neurologic disorder - we will refer to a neurologist . 
Formal exercise ABIs . 
Obtain angiographic studies from AC . 
Followup visit in one month .

Discussed ramification of this test . 
Will favor rechecking his PSA in one month . 
Due to recent DVT and his being on coumadin , he would not be amenable to undergo prostate biopsy in the next few weeks . 
If PSA remains high , will have him see urology . 
Total visit time was 4 0 minutes . 
In 7 / 7 7 , he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin , and developed diarrhea while in the hospital . 
After discharge , he continued to have profuse diarrhea , and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C . diff infection , first found to be positive on 7 / 3 1 / 7 7 . 
Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C . diff . 
Most recently , he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C . diff in 1 / 7 7 , with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl , and discharged to NAMG , where he was for 3 weeks . 
He received 2 1 days of flagyl . 
After about two weeks , he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency . 
Three weeks prior to admission , he began taking 5 0 0 mg PO Flagyl q 8 h , which he had at home . 
He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl . 
One week ago , he saw his PCP , where a C . diff stool toxin was negative . 
At that point , he stopped the PO flagyl , and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened . 
Currently he is having 1 0 BM per day , and he states that they are similar to odor , color , and frequency to his prior C . diff episodes .

As you know , she is just 5 2 years of age . 
Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide , hypertension , hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year . 
She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband . 
She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease . 
She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations . 
On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2 0 6 3 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem - pop bypass graft . 
This reconstruction is functioning well , as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side . 
In April of 2 0 6 3 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem - pop bypass graft to the above - knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins . 
There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent . 
She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit . 
By last spring , i . e . 
She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks . 
Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss . 
Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0 . 4 6 on the right and 0 . 8 on the left . 
Understandably Dr . Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations . 
She has sought an opinion here in this regard . 
She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2 0 6 1 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy . 
On physical examination blood pressure was 1 4 0 / 8 0 . 
Pulse was 7 0 and regular . 
Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits . 
She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem - pop bypass graft in situ is palpable , as is the left popliteal pulse . 
There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse . 
She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown . 
This is of course a very unhappy situation . 
Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good . 
However I am not absolutely ruling this out . 
I would suggest the following . 
Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor , aspirin and Plavix . 
Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit . 
She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me . 
If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered . 
I will get back to you after review of the films themselves . 
My thanks once again . 
With every best wish . 
Surgery is to be performed on 9 / 1 7 / 6 4 , by Dr . Iyer .

Patient has history of PVD , HTN type II diabetes , hyperlipidemia , chronic pancreatitis s / p Whipple , and no problems with general anesthesia . 
Anesthesia consent form and tentative plans reviewed and explained . 
Patient will sign anesthesia consent form day of surgery . 
Immediately following her 2 nd R fem - pop BPG in 9 / 2 0 6 4 , she felt well and without significant LE pain . 
Over the past month , however , the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her R foot and leg , which wakes her up from sleep almost every night . 
She can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest . 
She also has noticed discoloration of her R foot , along with numbness and paresthesias , which have been progressive over the same time period . 
She denies all symptoms other than RLE pain and claudication as described . 
Specifically , she denies chest pain , shortness of breath , dizziness , headache , and fevers / chills . 
She reports that her left leg is occasionally painful , although it has been tolerable in comparison to her R leg . 
She has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly , but has not taken coumadin for 2 days ( last dose 7 / 3 1 / 6 5 ) . 
She last underwent arterial LENIs on 7 / 1 7 / 6 5 , which demonstrated critical ischemia in her R leg and a thrombosed R fem - pop BPG ( see below for official report ) . 
She is admitted for elective revascularization of her R leg . 
Critical peripheral arterial disease in the right leg at rest . 
Disease is located in the aorto - iliac , femoral and popliteal segments on the right side . 
Mild peripheral arterial disease in the left leg at rest . 
Disease is located in the aorto - iliac and tibial / peroneal segments on the left side . 
Occlusion of the right femoral to popliteal PTFE bypass graft . 
Given her progressive pain , worsening PVRs , and thrombosed BPG , she will go to the OR 8 / 0 3 for fem - pop thrombectomy , possible fem - fem bypass graft , and angiogram with possible angioplasty / stent . 
Ate frequently but watched portions . 
Apparently patient checks blood sugars between 3 : 0 0 and 3 : 0 0 and when she has shakiness . 
She was under the impression that after lunch she had to fast for three hours prior to checking sugar , at which point notes low blood sugars in the 5 0 ' s to 7 0 ' s with shakiness , for which she takes a handful of raisins . 
Generally eats breakfast at 8 : 3 0 , lunch 1 2 : 0 0 or 1 2 : 3 0 , supper at 5 : 3 0 . 
Snacks in the evening , always apple and yogurt . 
Most recently , additionally popcorn and saltine crackers , occasional pretzels . 
After takes raisins , shakiness of hypoglycemic symptoms resolve . 
While on cruise , patient found that she could actually walk more than she thought she could . 
Since she has been home , has not been walking routinely . 
States taking glucosamine chondroitin . 
Over the last two or three months , feels that it is helping with decreased pain . 
Also has been seen at physical therapy again . 
Feels that this is helping . 
Blood pressure , right arm : 1 2 6 / 6 8 . 
Chest is clear . 
Cardiac : Regular rhythm at 6 6 , no murmur or gallop . 
Have asked patient to decrease popcorn and / or crackers at h . s . 
Continue current treatment . 
Continue for now . 
Return to clinic at the beginning of November to Dr . Ullom to resume care . 
Her spouse is present . 
Patient says she is status post a fall this past Monday at home . 
Says that she seems to have lost her balance while opening a door at home . 
Denies prodromal symptoms including shortness of breath , dizziness , or palpitations . 
There was no loss of consciousness . 
Patient was seen in the emergency room that day for trauma to the head . 
Had a negative CT of her head and had an x - ray of her pelvis , as she complained of some hip pain . 
Both studies were negative . 
Patient was then sent home with Roxicet . 
Patient was seen in the walk - in clinic at CPI yesterday , after noticing a swollen tongue and some difficulty swallowing . 
Patient was immediately told to stop both her Roxicet and Monopril and was treated for angioedema with Zantac and Claritin . 
Today patient has no further throat tightness or tongue swelling . 
She is , however , uncomfortable continuing the Effexor for unclear reasons and wants to stop it . 
Patient is also complaining of severe low back pain , which she says has persisted since her fall on Monday . 
Did not have an x - ray of the area . 
Says it is very painful to sit . 
Roxicet was not helping . 
She is off her Ultram as well .

Will switch from Vicodin to Vicodin ES 1 q . 
Knows to go to ER if experiences any symptoms consistent with angioedema . 
Return to clinic in approximately one month . 
Susan Ullom , M . D . 
The patient was in her usual state of health with some residual weakness from the stenosis and occasional buckling of her knees without loss of consciousness until 1 2 / 0 1 when she fell backwards . 
There was no obvious leg buckling . 
She said she just came off balance without loss of consciousness or dizziness or preceding lightheadedness . 
Since then she has had several falls always when she is moving . 
Ultram q . i . d . 
Neurontin 3 0 0 q . i . d . 
She has had weight loss without fevers , chills or night sweat . 
She has had no retinopathy and she has a history of reflux and otherwise her cardiovascular , pulmonary , GI / GU and musculoskeletal review of systems are unremarkable . 
She has had left knee arthroscopy . 
She had mild spinal stenosis at T 1 2 to L 1 , severe at L 3 / 4 and 4 / 5 with bilateral foraminal disease . 
She has had a ten year history of diabetes . 
She has hypertension and hypothyroidism . 
No history of tobacco or alcohol . 
Her mental state examination is normal . 
Cranial nerves II through XII are intact . 
Motor strength is significant for full strength in the upper extremities as well as the lower extremities . 
Sensation is intact to all modalities with bilateral lower extremity dysesthesia reported subjectively . 
DTR ' s are symmetric with downgoing toes bilaterally . 
Coordination is intact with no axial or appendicular ataxia . 
We will obtain an MRI of her lumbosacral to evaluate that area for any recurrent pathology or new changes . 
For her radicular pain will increase her Neurontin 4 0 0 q . i . d . 
We would like to obtain EMG with nerve conduction studies of the lower extremities to evaluate possible need for reoperation . 
The patient will return to clinic after these studies . 
The patient was seen and evaluated and management was discussed with the attending . 
Ms . Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1 / 6 6 ; she was required sub - occipital craniotomy , clot evacuation , and placement for a VP shunt . 
She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2 / 6 6 , and was d / c ' d 5 / 3 1 / 6 6 . 
Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication . 
She gets nutrition and medication through a G - tube at this point , and has had an indwelling foley catheter . 
Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5 , the indwelling foley catheter had been removed . 
However , the patient ' s constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry , the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8 / 5 / 6 6 . 
U / A was suggestive of a UTI , and she was treated with a 3 - day course of levofloxacin . 
There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time , and urine cultures were not sent . 
She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation . 
In the ED , repeat U / A was consistent with UTI ; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus . 
She was given a dose of levofloxacin 5 0 0 mg and transferred to the floor . 
Type II diabetes mellitus . 
Has VNA come into home to help with care . 
Sleepy , but easily arousable . 
HEENT : PER 3 to 2 bilaterally . 
Slight crusting over eyelids bilaterally . 
Anicteric sclera , no conjunctival injection . 
EOMI . 
Continuous purposeful tongue movements . 
Dry mucous membranes , but pt breathes solely through mouth . 
Neck plethoric ; difficult to assess JVD . 
Carotids 2 + bilaterally , no bruits . 
No thyromegaly , no cervical adenopathy . 
Soft , non - distended . 
Does not appear to be tender . 
Neuro : Sleeping but arousable , follows simple commands , but not able to answer questions . 
Good hand squeeze bilaterally . 
DTRs difficult to elicit in arms , 2 + in patellae bilaterally . 
No significant change compared to prior CT Brain - 0 4 / 1 8 / 2 0 6 6 . 
No change in ventricle size . 
Flattened T - waves , but not changed from prior exam . 
No evidence of acute ischemia . 
Mental status changes : given likely undertreated UTI 8 / 0 9 / 6 6 , pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source . 
Important to rule out VP - shunt complication as cause of mental status chage , but CT appears unchanged from 4 / 6 6 . 
If low sodium high osm , likely hypovolemic . 
If higher sodium , more likely SIADH . 
Pt . 
She is s / p suprapubic catheter placement by IR on 2 / 4 / 2 0 6 7 . 
She was discharged from PDI on 2 / 0 9 / 2 0 6 7 after an admission for occlusion of her superpublic catheter . 
She represents to the ED today after her husband , who is the primary care giver noted on the morning of admit that the catheter was not draining , but the pt . 
Of urine . 
He attempted to flush the catheter and was unable to . 
VNA was called and also attempted to flush the catheter . 
The VNA nurse noted that it was possible to instill water , but not possible to draw any back . 
VNA contacted the pts . 
PCP and IR , who placed the catheter on her previous admit , and the pt . 
Minimally responsive at baseline . 
NO decbus . 
PPP . 
Opens eyes to voice , some rigidity upper and lower extremities . 
Foley in place draining clear urine . 
Will send UA / Culture . 
Contact IR for revision of tube given 2 nd admission this month for occlusion . 
She presented to the Emergency Room 5 . 5 hours after last seeming normal . 
Her initial NI stroke scale was 1 1 . 
She was admitted to the Neurology Service for a stroke workup . 
Her imaging studies showed a left MCA infarct involving the left corona radiata , head of the caudate basal ganglia , and an MI cutoff on the CTA and MRA in addition to a left ICA occlusion . 
She was taken to angiogram for interventional neuroradiology . 
She had an angiogram . 
Radiology felt they were unable to access the cause and no intervention was attempted and the patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU for blood pressure monitoring and hypertensive therapy . 
She remained stable anti - coagulated on heparin . 
During the hospital stay , she spontaneously converted to rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation , which was felt to be the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned to remain anti - coagulated . 
She was discharged to rehab and subsequently went home from rehab on 0 8 / 0 4 / 2 0 6 7 . 
At home , she had been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has been feeling O . K . 
VNA sees her once a week . 
At rehab , for unclear reasons , her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to the discharging physician from the Tracy Medical Clinic , this was done for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient is unaware of any such problems . 
She continues to get PT and occupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memory remains poor . 
According to the family member and her daughter who are here interpreting for her at Clinic today , she continues to have right - sided weakness , although significantly improved and decreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be able to communicate well with her . 
Since her discharge , she has not had any new episodes of numbness , weakness , headaches , or visual changes . 
Review of neurological systems as above . 
No history of tobacco or alcohol . 
There is no thyromegaly . 
She is attentive . 
She is non - fluent with really minimal verbal output . 
She has decreased naming and decreased comprehension . 
She does not have any neglect or apraxia . 
Registration is 3 / 4 . 
Short - term memory is 0 / 4 in 5 minutes . 
Pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters . 
Fundi are normal . 
Extraocular movements are intact with nystagmus . 
Visual fields are full to confrontation . 
She has a right facial droop . 
Facial sensation is intact .

She has strength on the left is normal . 
On the right , her strength is at least 4 / 5 in all muscle groups on the left on the neck , except for about 3 / 5 in the distal arm . 
She reports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm . 
There is no ataxia on the left . 
Gait is slow , walks with a cane , and so conducts the right leg . 
Her reflexes are brisker on the right at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response . 
On the CT , there was a question of a left MI cutoff . 
CT angiogram also showed a distal left ICA stenosis with minimal distal interflow . 
MRI of the brain showed a left MCA infarction involving the left corona radiata , head of the caudate basal ganglia . 
She has had mild to moderate chronic small vessel ischemic changes on her MRI . 
Echo showed a normal EF of 5 5 % without any clot , no PFO . 
On exam , she has residual aphasia involving both comprehension and fluency ; and a moderate right hemiparesis . 
It is unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given her stroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during her hospital stay , I think that she would benefit from anti - coagulation therapy . 
I have asked her to get a follow up PCP evaluation at the OCH to determine if indeed there are any contraindications to anti - coagulation . 
If there are no such contraindications , she should restart on warfarin . 
In addition , her blood pressure is still not well controlled and I would ask her to increase her Captopril to 1 2 . 5 mg t . i . d . 
RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 . 
Continue anti - hypertensive and increase Captopril to 1 2 . 5 mg t . i . d . 
Blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment . 
Continue risk factor modification with the management of blood pressure , diabetes , and hypercholesterol as she is doing . 
PCP evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehab stay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindications per the PCP . 
Continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gait training and language rehab . 
Return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any new problems . 
More than 5 0 % of this clinic visit was spent on patient education and counseling .

THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY . 
She has an extremely complicated history of R and now L . foot infections and ulcerations , in setting of here severe neuropathy and DM . 
She originally sustained a R . 5 th metatarsal fracture in 2 0 8 3 , with poor union , and subsequent fracture of her 2 nd & # 8 2 1 1 ; 4 th metatarsals . 
She developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her R . lateral metatarsal heads , with underlying osteomyelitis & # 8 2 1 2 ; this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics . 
She underwent I + D of her R . foot ulceration in 1 2 / 8 9 , OR cultures grew P . aeruginosa . 
In 3 / 9 0 , she underwent debridement of her chronic R . lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting . 
In 6 / 9 0 , she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5 th metatarsal osteomyelitis , along with excision of her 5 th metatarsal & # 8 2 1 2 ; bone cultures grew MSSA . 
She did well until 2 / 9 2 , when she underwent R . ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her R . hindfoot ( calcaneal osteotomy , lateral translation , dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy , and Achilles lengthening ) . 
She subsequently developed a R . heel ulceration , and in 4 / 9 2 , underwent debridement of this ulceration , removal of a screw , and placement of a vacuum sponge . 
Her wound continued to heal poorly , and she underwent R . SFA to posterior tibial bypass grafting . 
In 7 / 9 2 , she underwent debridement of her R . heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft , which has taken well ; she feels that her R . heel has been healing nicely . 
During her long hospitalization in 4 / 9 2 , she started developing L . heel and L . forefoot ulcerations . 
She attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed , and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure , which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically . 
These ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months , and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8 / 9 2 . 
She received vancomycin , levofloxacin , flagyl initially , then augmentin , with persistent poor healing of her wounds . 
On 9 / 1 0 , she underwent operative debridement of her L . plantar heel ulcer & # 8 2 1 2 ; she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow - brown tissue underlying her L . heel eschar , which was extensively debrided ; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively . 
She had an angiogram on 9 / 1 2 , which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her LLE , and good flow through her prior R . SFA to posterior tibial bypas graft . 
She feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently ; she feels that her R . heel is almost completely healed , and that her L . heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously . 
Her L . forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past . 
Over the past 2 - 3 days , she developed fairly acute swelling , erythema , and pain around her forefoot ulcer , with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot . 
She was seen in vascular surgery clinic , and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement . 
She has a chronic & # 8 2 1 6 ; fast heartbeat , & # 8 2 1 7 ; denies any systemic symptoms ( no fevers , chills , sweats , notable weight changes ) , headaches , sinus symptoms , sore throat , cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , blood in her bowel movements , dysuria , frequency , LE edema , rashes , myalgias , or new arthralgias . 
She feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin . 
Her renal function is impaired from her DM & # 8 2 1 2 ; would check a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose . 
Unable to stand for mammography because of her foot issues & # 8 2 1 2 ; will discuss optimal imaging of her L . breast with breast radiology , will hopefully be able to obtain this study during this hospitalization . 
Discussed with Dr . Craig Faulkner , ID Attending . 
Recommendations discussed with Dr . Zane Querry of primary team . 
Thank you for this interesting consult & # 8 2 1 2 ; we will continue to follow with you . 
Pt was initially treated with insulin and has been requiring insulin since diagnosis . 
Pt was started on an insulin pump in 2 0 7 9 . 
Current basal rates are 0 . 6 units from 1 2 am - 6 am , 0 . 7 units from 6 am to 6 : 3 0 pm and then 0 . 6 units at 6 : 3 0 pm again . 
Pt uses a carb ratio of 1 0 : 1 . 
Pt cannot recall her correction factor as it is programmed into her pump . 
Monitors her blood glucoses at least 4 times per day and reports variable glucoses for 7 0 - & gt ; 2 0 0 . 
Reports hypoglycemic episodes 1 - 2 times per week and she is usually symptomatic with glucoses of 7 0 . 
Reports that she was admitted to the hospital about one month ago with DKA . 
States that she had flu - like symptoms and severe vomiting and was admitted ot Ames Pathology Center for treatment . 
Had never had DKA before . 
Pt reports complications associated with diabetes . 
Reports retinopathy and has had several laster surgeries . 
Reports nephropathy as well as an episode of renal failure related to a hospitalization this summer . 
Reports peripheral neuropathy as well as peripheral vascular disease , including non - healing ulcers that have lead to right TMA . 
Patient is admitted for stenosis of right bypass graft stenosis and is going to the cath lab for angiogram shortly . 
Currently receiving D 5 W with 1 5 0 meq of Bicarb at 1 2 5 ccs / hr for renal protection . 
No icterus . 
No acanthosis nigricans . 
Neurological Examination : Alert and oriented to person , place , time , and situation . 
Grossly nonfocal exam . 
Psychiatric : Mood and affect appropriate to situation . 
Extremity exam : No pedal edema , right foot with bandage . 
Pt appears alert , oriented and confident to use her insulin pump in the hospital . 
Pt is able to verbalize her insulin doses and states that she would prefer to continue with pump use . 
Suspect that IV fluids are contributing to hyperglycemia , therefore reluctant to change insulin doses since IV fluids will likely stop later today . 
While in procedure , will need to monitor blood glucoses more closely , but anticipate that pump can continue as programmed . 
Recommendations 1 . 
Continue with insulin pump . 
Pt agrees to all of the above . 
Monitor blood glucoses at least before all meals and at bedtime . 
Please also check blood glucoses with any symptoms of hypoglycemia or at pt ' s request . 
Be sure to record these values on the daily flow sheet . 
For procedure today , I spoke with Kathryn Kincaid and asked that blood glucoses be monitored hourly while in cath lab unless BG is less than 1 4 0 . 
If BG less than 1 4 0 , monitor blood glucoses every 3 0 minutes . 
Treat BG less than 8 0 with 1 / 2 amp D 5 0 and continue to monitor as described above . 
Do not remove insulin pump .

Diabetes dept will continue to monitor . 
Please page 5 - 8 1 1 2 with any questions or concerns . 
Thank you . 
Consultation was requested by Dr . Katz for recommendations regarding antibiotic management . 
She underwent R femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft in 5 / 9 2 and skin grafting in 7 / 9 2 . 
R heel wound subsequently improved but pt developed L plantar ulceration requiring debridement 1 0 / 9 2 . 
Cultures grew MSSA . 
Pt was subsequently treated w / extended course of doxycycline , rifampin through 2 / 9 3 . 
She subsequently did well until developing R heel ulcer while undergoing psychiatric hospitalization in mid 2 / 9 4 . 
She was initially hospitalized at Altadena Hospital , where she underwent debridement of wound and treatment w / extended course of penicillin VK and probenicid . 
Wound failed to improve . 
Pt was rehospitalized on 3 / 1 8 at GCCfor further management . 
She underwent incision and debridement on 3 / 1 8 . 
Intraoperative evaluation revealed ulcer wound tracking to bone . 
Intraoperative gram stain revealed GPCs in pairs . 
Intraoperative cultures are pending . 
Pt was subsequently treated w / vancomycin , levofloxacin and metronidazole . 
On interview , pt reports feeling generally well . 
No F / C / NS . 
Appetite normal . 
Intraoperative cultures show involvement of bone . 
Clinical picture is concerning for osteomyelitis . 
Possible culprit organisms include drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which should be treated empirically while awaiting cultures . 
Pt will likely require an extended course of IV therapy for treatment of osteomyelitis . 
Discontinue levofloxacin , metronidazole . 
Also with frontal - occipital headache during this time . 
He presented to the Sheffield Center ED , and shortly after he was seen his left sided weakness resolved , although his visual field deficits and right hand paresthesia as well as his headache had remained . 
He denies F / C / N / V . 
No neck stiffness . 
He had a noncontrast head CT which was negative for any acute process per radiology read . 
He had an LP with 2 WBC , 2 RBC , glucose 9 8 , protein 8 4 , appeared clear .

Mr . Aguilar is a 4 8 yo man with h / o CF with mild pulmonary disease , who presented to an OSH on 1 / 2 6 with sudden onset of right upper ext paresthesias , followed by a loss of left visual field , diplopia , and left sided weakness . 
The patient denies incontinence but had some gait instability related to weakness . 
The patient was evaluated at the OSH with non - contrast head CT and L / P which were significant only for elevated CSF protein . 
Currently symptoms have resolved other than persistent occipital headache which began with the onset of the other symptoms , as well as unilateral hemianopsia in the left eye evident on exam . 
Exam also notable for disdiadochokinesis , otherwise neurologic exam non - focal . 
Lung exam notable for diminished BS but no wheezes or crackles . 
DDX for above includes ischemic process , though symptoms appear to be multi - focal , vs . mononeuritis multiplex related to inflammatory process . 
Less likely is mass lesion leading to above symptoms , or meningeal process . 
We plan to obtain CNS MRI , neuro consult . 
Will await MRI findings prior to pursuing further serologic work - up . 
Continue maintenance medications for CF . 
Please see additional comments below .

He is living with his son and daughter - in - law in Harrisburg . 
He has mostly been in the hospital over the last several months . 
He had been with the city of Cadiz for 3 2 years . 
Endoscopy in 2 0 8 7 showed gastritis . 
General : Good mood . 
No F / S / C . 
Depressed with chronic illness , extremely fatigued .

He has had melena in the past , most recently grape jelly like clots of blood . 
He has had anorexia . 
No abdominal pain , no vomiting . 
No motion of the left shoulder ulcer as noted above . 
Laboratory data and Old record reviewed extensive records . 
Long discussion with the family regarding previous care . 
Acute problem today is massive GI bleed without clear etiology . 
History of heart failure with significant weakness , shortness of breath , recent chest pain , nonhealing ulcer on his left shoulder , all requiring emergency hospitalization , and he will be sent to the BARH ER at once . 
Long discussion with the family about this and his other chronic problems including diabetes and episodes of hypoglycemia . 
Mr . Moss has experienced multiple falls recently , and was ultimately diagnosed with Parkinsons last September . 
Following the diagnosis , he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital , where he continued to experience falls . 
After one episode , he was forcibly picked up , and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter . 
He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal . 
After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain , erythema , and warmth , he was re - hospitalized at Ouagadougou , where he underwent L shoulder aspiration . 
MRI 1 0 / 8 7 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff , with associated large joint effusion . 
Of note , he denied fevers , chills , or NS . 
L shoulder aspiration 1 0 / 1 0 / 8 7 demonstrated purulent fluid , with 2 , 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 WBC ( 9 7 % PMN ) . 
Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters . 
He subsequently underwent L shoulder I & D 1 0 / 1 2 , with removal of 3 0 0 cc of frankly purulent fluid . 
He was started on cefazolin . 
Culture results returned a pan - sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate ( including to ampicillin , cefazolin , clindamycin , penicillin , rifampin ) . 
Blood cultures were negative . 
He was taken back to the OR 1 0 / 1 6 for arthroscopy , with extensive debridement . 
Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue , with no normal - appearing cartiledge present . 
A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess , and a second in the subacromial space . 
He was transitioned to ampicillin 2 g q 6 hours x 2 weeks , and then given amoxicillin ( either 1 g BID or 5 0 0 mg TID , unsure which ) x 2 weeks . 
Repeat R shoulder MRI obtained 1 2 / 1 2 / 8 7 , which was reviewed with staff radiologist , and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra / infraspinatus / teres minor / subscapularis / biceps tendons , with also persistent large joint effusion , extensive synovitis , and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head . 
Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head . 
Overall , was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease . 
Mr . Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1 / 1 8 , at which time he complained of a several week h / o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity . 
He did not experience shoulder pain at rest , and had not recently noted erythema . 
No drainage . 
Appetite was near baseline , though he had experienced fatigue . 
Blood glucoses had been well controlled . 
His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs , which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 1 0 3 , with stable pulse / BP , and overall well controlled blood sugars . 
Following the fall , he had significantly increased hip pain . 
Hip / pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2 mm superolaterally and along the stem . 
Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision . 
ROS : as per HPI . 
Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall . 
No cough , sore throat , chest discomfort , abdominal pain , dysuria , diarrhea . 
Extensive ROS otherwise negative . 
S / p R THA with revision x 2 , last 2 0 8 1 ( Kent ) , s / p l THA with revision x 1 .

Neuro : MS : awake , alert , oriented to person , place , time . 
CN II - XII intact . 
Motor exam limited by shoulder pain , though strength exam non - focal when adjusted for injuries . 
Mildly shuffling gait noted on Wednesday in clinic , not tested today . 
Resting tremor , pill rolling . 
Lines : no erythema . 
The acetabular component demonstrates vertical inclination with evidence of polyethylene wear . 
The femoral component demonstrates lucency measuring more than 2 mm superolaterally and along the stem consistent with granulomatous disease . 
There is no subsidence or loosening based on Grauer ' s classification . 
AP chest film : no acute pulmonary process , probable cardiomegaly . 
Assessment : 7 7 yo M with DMII , CHF ( EF 2 0 - 2 5 % ) , afib , Parkinson ' s , prostate cancer s / p XRT c / b proctitis and GIB , multiple hip replacements , recently treated for S . aureus L shoulder septic arthritis ( 1 0 / 8 7 - 1 1 / 8 7 ) who presented 1 / 1 9 s / p fall . 
With regards to his shoulder , it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4 - week abx course . 
Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam , 2 months after completion of his course , it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis . 
The MRI is difficult to interpret , and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes . 
He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers ( though confounded by multiple comorbidities ) . 
Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection , our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically , off abx , for signs of recurrent infection . 
However , given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement , would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder . 
As such , would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics . 
The source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated , and blood cultures were negative . 
However , such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding , and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected . 
This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening . 
Alternatively , he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls , or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca ( ? read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis ) . 
We will continue to follow with you . 
Mr . Moss is 7 8 years old .

May have been triggered by pneumonia . 
No chest pain to suggest recent MI . 
No sign of PE . 
Hemodynamically stable . 
CHADS 2 score 2 , so warfarin is indicated for anticoagulation .

I agree with the findings and recommendations in Dr . Lilly ' s note , with any small exceptions or points of emphasis noted below . 
Please refer to it for details of HPI , PMH , medications and allergies , family and social history , laboratory and other data , and ROS . 
He has improved with heart rate control . 
Exam VS - as noted General - pleasant obese white man with severe pectus deformity . 
Breathing with abdominal muscles tensed on expiration . 
Bicarb 3 1 , BNP 2 0 5 0 , WBC 1 5 , INR 3 . 1 . 
Given the severe pectus deformity as well as his history of lung - toxic chemotherapy drugs and XRT , he may have some restrictive lung disease that would limit his cardiopulmonary reserve . 
I would not be surprised if he additionally has obstructive lung disease , given the " belly breathing " and the wheezing he had last admission . 
May need Toprol XL 1 0 0 BID . 
Best to maximize utility of BB prior to adding other agents . 
Filter all IVs ( PFO ) PFTs and Pulmonology consult as an outpatient Balance of plan per Dr . Lilly . 
In brief , this is a 5 4 y / o M hx neurofibromatosis , Hodgkin ' s lymphoma s / p chemo / XRT in the 7 0 s , DMII ( A 1 c 6 . 5 in 0 3 / 8 4 ) , HTN , obesity and new diagnosis of Afib , recently discharged from the Mediquik 2 days prior to readmission 6 / 1 3 where he was being treated for AF w / RVR . 
His toprol was increased from 1 0 0 mg dily to 1 0 0 mg BID at that time . 
Prior w / u w / fairly nl TTE and nl TSH . 
Now returned for his third admission with AF w / RVR , rates into the 1 4 0 s . 
He is considerably symptomatic with the AF w / palpitations , lightheadedness , dyspnea , and diaphoresis . 
HD stable . 
He has been on increasing doses of Toprol without effect given this is his third admission . 
He was also given 0 . 5 mg digoxin for possible dig load . 
Given he was failing on Toprol 1 0 0 mg BID his medications were switched to diltiazem 6 0 mg q 6 hr to see if a different drug class might help . 
Cardiology / EP was consulted for the possibility of ablation given this was his third admission and he is so symptomatic . 
EP decided to start the patient on sotalol 8 0 - mg BID with the plan to increase sotalol to 1 2 0 mg BID on 6 / 1 5 if Qtc remains stable ( & lt ; 5 0 0 msec ) . 
He is planned to received 5 doses of sotalol prior to dispo and if he remained in aflutter through 6 / 1 5 is to get DCCV on 6 / 1 6 . 
He received his first and only dose in the pm 6 / 1 4 . 
Overnight he was bradycardic into the 4 0 s while sleeping . 
He had a 3 . 5 second pause however on telemetry . 
His heart rates have ranged from 4 5 - 6 0 in AFlutter . 
BPs 9 0 s systolic . 
Per EP , as pt asleep , will con ' t sotalol . 
He is on coumadin for anticoagulation .

ASSESSMENT : Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . 
PLAN : LFTs , A 1 C , basic panel this evening . 
Glucotrol 1 0 mg dispense No . 
Otherwise , she states she has been feeling well . 
She denies any nausea , vomiting or diarrhea . 
She has a history of non - insulin - dependent diabetes at this time . 
ASSESSMENT : 1 . 
Non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus , moderate control . 
Tinea pedis . 
Grace Vann , N . P . 
She has adult - onset diabetes , which in the past has required treatment with insulin . 
She has been managed with oral hypoglycemics because of her reticence to using injections . 
She also has a history of CVA . 
I last saw her in August of last year . 
She was seen by Ms . Vann , our nurse practitioner in early May . 
According to Ms . Vann ' s note of Apr 2 9 , 2 0 7 3 , she is also supposed to be taking metformin 5 0 0 mg one in the morning and two with the evening meal as was prescribed back in 2 0 7 2 . 
The patient and her son today are not sure that she is taking this medication . 
In fact , they believe that she is not . 
There has been moderate polyuria and polydipsia . 
Control of diabetes has been erratic . 
Hemoglobin A 1 c has been elevated . 
On Apr 2 9 , 2 0 7 3 , blood glucose was 2 7 4 , BUN was 2 5 , creatinine 1 . 0 , electrolytes within normal limits as was calcium . 
Cholesterol was 3 1 5 . 
Hemoglobin A 1 c 1 0 . 6 . 
The patient has not experienced chest pain , palpitations but she is moderately short of breath when climbing stairs . 
There has been no orthopnea and no PND . 
She denies dysuria and urgency and has not experienced near syncope . 
She denies nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation . 
Blood pressure 1 2 2 / 6 6 . 
The heart rate is 9 0 and regular , weight 1 1 3 pounds , approximately five pounds less than last year . 
Random blood glucose was 2 2 4 . 
The patient suffered a minor CVA back in September 2 0 7 1 . 
She denies any recurrence of motor deficits or symptoms suggestive of TIA . 
The patient has a past history of hyperthyroidism that was treated with iodine 1 3 1 . 
She has not been hypothyroid since then . 
In fact , the last TSH level was 0 . 0 5 in August of last year , just prior to her departure to Ghana . 
She denies heat intolerance as well as palpitations . 
On physical examination , she is a small lady in no acute distress . 
The neck veins are flat . 
The extraocular movements are full . 
There are no symptoms of hyperthyroidism . 
The chest is clear to auscultation . 
The heart sounds are regular . 
There are no rubs or gallops . 
The lower extremities are free of edema and now her toes are free of fungi but the nails are overgrown and require attention . 
She does not have obvious symptoms of hyperthyroidism but today I have obtained a repeat TSH as well as T 3 and T 4 . 
Diabetes continues to be a problem . 
Glycemic control continues to be difficult to achieve . 
Today , I have reinstated metformin at 5 0 0 mg p . o . 
The son is going to check on the medications to make certain that indeed she is not taking this medicine at this point . 
The other medications were continued . 
It is indeed possible that she will need insulin in the near future . 
I plan close followup and will see her again in six weeks ' time . 
If she is hyperthyroid , this may also explain the difficulty in achieving glycemic control . 
Against this is the high cholesterol . 
She used to be on Lipitor , which was discontinued during her trip to Ghana . 
I have reinstated the Lipitor today 2 0 mg p . o . 
I have also added a small dose of enalapril 2 . 5 mg p . o . 
Basicallty the diagnosis was anxiety . 
Sent for fup with pcp . 
Symtpoms all resolved . 
Hyperthyroidism : I - 1 3 1 5 years ago . 
Energy : good . 
Legally blind . 
Abd : Soft , non - tender . 
Extr : no edema . 
Pt was seen last week by Dr . Anderson and prior to that she was at Chesterfield ED and prior to that her son reports that she had been in Ghanna . 
I suspect she has been under someone else ' s care since I never prescribed Glyburide , Actos and Insulin . 
She did not keep subsequent appointments . 
She was seen at Chesterfield ED because of pyelonephritis / UTI treated with ceftriaxone and discharged on Nitrofurantoin . 
She has now completed the treatment . 
She feels better although there is still mild dysuria , denies chills and fever . 
Hyperthyroidism : I - 1 3 1 5 years ago . 
PE : Appears elderly but in no distress . . Comes accompanied by son . 
Lungs : clear bilaterally Heart : regular , normal S 1 and S 2 . 
I have DC Actos and kept her on Glyburide and current dose of insulin . 
Instructed son to call if hypoglycemic or if Sx of UTI reccur . 
Plan to see her in one week and will then DC Glyburide . 
Son denies taking her to another MD . 
I will obtain a second urine culture and sensitivities . 
As you will remember he recently underwent right carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty after treatment of a severe underlying pneumonia . 
He returns today reporting that he is doing well from a neurologic standpoint . 
He has had no focal , motor , sensory deficits , and no amaurosis fugax . 
A follow up duplex examination performed in our vascular laboratory reveals mild right ICA disease after his carotid endarterectomy with moderate left ICA stenosis which should be followed over time . 
It would be prudent to see him again in follow up evaluation in six months ' time with a repeat carotid duplex examination . 
I would be happy to assist in the management of this or any of your other patients as you deem necessary in the future . 
Thank you again for allowing me to assist in his care . 
If I can be of any further assistance , please feel free to contact either myself or one of my partners directly .

Of note , he was hospitalized from May 2 6 until May 2 9 for a COPD flare , and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper , which he completed about one week ago . 
He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping . 
But on the evening of June 1 3 he began to feel short of breath , without cough or chest pain , and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion . 
Not made worse with lying down . 
He also had a fever to 1 0 3 , without mental status changes . 
EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 4 0 s ; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 6 0 0 cc of urine . 
He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing , breathing in the 4 0 s , afebrile , tachycardic to 1 4 7 bpm . 
An ABG on BIPAP showed 7 . 3 5 / 5 3 / 1 0 0 . 
His blood pressure dropped from systolic 1 3 0 s to 7 0 / 5 0 , and so he was subsequently intubated , and a central and arterial lines placed . 
He was given approximately 2 L of NS with resultant CVP of 1 1 . 
He was also started on dopamine , which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine . 
He was given vancomycin , levaquin , and flagyl , as well as a dose of solumedrol . 
He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine . 
Review of Systems : per HPI ; no changes in mental status ; no cough , chest pain , palpitations ; no N / V / C / D ; no BRBPR or melena ; no sick contacts . 
He had a fever to 1 0 3 , and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation . 
He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1 . 6 ; his chest x - ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia , and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching . 
His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia . 
The patient was admitted to the Ross Medical Center with pneumonia on three occasions in the last 6 weeks . 
He was discharged home and completed the most recent course of antibiotics today . 
He has noted increasing shortness of breath , wheezing , decreased exercise tolerance prompting him to seek medical attention . 
The patient denied fever , productive cough , nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , chest pain . 
He has completed his course of oral antibiotics and remains on oral Prednisone . 
Will continue oral Prednisone and continue aggressive nebulizer treatments . 
He may require higher dose of oral steroids and subsequent taper . 
His chest x - ray does NOT demonstrate a focal area of consolidation at this time . 
Yamilex is a 6 8 - year - old woman who I know quite well status post a stroke in 2 0 8 3 . 
In 2 0 8 3 Mrs . Ordonez presented with ataxia and dizziness . 
She was found to have a left vertebral stenosis and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution stroke . 
She was found to be hypertensive at that time and was started on atenolol . 
Mrs . Ordonez blood pressure was not well controlled on atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide . 
Triamterene was added . 
Unfortunately she represented with recurrent ataxia and dizziness possibly due to overtreatment of her blood pressure . 
Of note , she was only mildly orthostatic at that time . 
She also had an E . coli urinary tract infection which may have been complicating matters . 
Mrs . Ordonez has had borderline glucose intolerance as well as an elevated alkaline / phosphatase . 
She had had a hemoglobin A 1 C of 6 % tested in 2 0 8 3 . 
Yamilex is generally doing well . 
She has no particular complaints . 
She has had an active summer getting out to the beach and walks the shopping mall with her daughter with good energy . 
She has had no chest pains , shortness of breath , alterations in her bowel or bladder habits . 
Heart rate was 8 2 and regular . 
The HEENT examination was unremarkable . 
Neck was supple without adenopathy . 
There were 2 + carotids without bruits and there were no vertebral bruits . 
Chest was clear to auscultation . 
Cardiac exam showed an S 4 gallop . 
Abdomen examination was benign and extremities were without edema . 
Neurological examination showed reflexes to be 2 + in the upper extremities and at the knees bilaterally with downgoing toes . 
Finger - nose - finger was intact , Romberg was intact , and gait was stable with a narrow base . 
Hypertension . 
Mrs . Ordonez blood pressure is currently not well controlled . 
She has unfortunately had inadequate follow up for her hypertension . 
I will start her on 5 mg . of Zestril in addition to her standing 7 5 of atenolol . 
Neurologic . 
Mrs . Ordonez is stable status post her stroke . 
She will continue on Coumadin . 
I will not plan any further neurological work up at this time . 
Primary care issues . 
Mrs . Ordonez had a cholesterol in 2 0 8 3 of 2 1 0 . 
I will test a follow up cholesterol level given that she needs good secondary prevention status post her stroke . 
I will also check a random glucose level today as diabetes does run in the family and Mrs . Ordonez has had borderline elevated sugars in the past . 
I have also started Mrs . Ordonez on a multivitamin with minerals as well as 8 0 0 IU a day of vitamin E at the recommendation of Dr . Quesenberry . 
I will see Mrs . Ordonez in approximately six to eight weeks to reassess her blood pressure and her response to the addition of lisinopril . 
The patient was seen with Richard Quesenberry , M . D . 
Michael Goldberg , M . D . 
Work - up revealed left vertebral stenosis . 
She recovered after the event to her baseline , and now has no complaints of HA , dizziness , ataxia , paresthesias , or motor weakness . 
She is chronically anticoagulated and followed in coumadin clinic ; recent INR was 2 . 6 . 
She is now on Atenolol 7 5 mg po qd and Zestril 1 0 mg po qd for control of her hypertension . 
She does not measure her blood pressure at home . 
She has no known history of retinopathy , nephropathy , CAD , or neuropathy . 
She has no complaints of visual changes , chest pain / SOB , paresthesias , or bloating / early satiety . 
She has noticed some increase in thirst ( 7 glasses of water / day ) which she attributes to the heat and she has nocturia ( 2 x per night ) which has been stable over a couple of years . 
Microcalcifications were noted on mammography and bilateral excisional biopsies revealed benign fibroadenoma without evidence of malignancy . 
Mammography on 7 / 2 8 / 8 6 was normal . 
It is slightly sore to touch , and is non - pruritic and does not bleed . 
Does complain of mild chronic dry cough . 
She is therapeutic on her coumadin . 
She will continue coumadin and I will attempt to address CVA risk factors such as HTN and dyslipidemia ( will avoid lowering BP excessively to preserve vertebral perfusion ) . 
Her heart rate is 7 4 ; I will increase her Atenolol to 1 0 0 mg qd . 
She does not complain of any side effects from her medications . 
She does have a chronic , mild dry cough which is possibly related to her Zestril . 
She has had a little polydipsia / polyuria . 
Today I will check a glucose and HbA 1 c level .

She also does not want a pneumovax today , although she is willing to have her tetanus . 
She has also agreed to start taking calcium / vitamin D as well as an MVI . 
She has had recent mammography . 
I would increase her atenolol to 1 0 0 mg in the morning and 5 0 mg in the late afternoon . 
Diabetes is in suboptimal control , despite maximum dose Micronase . 
Creatinine of 1 . 4 would argue against using Glucophage . 
Check hemoglobin A 1 C and then we will decide on her medication .

THESE SECTIONS MAY NOT HAVE COPIED COMPLETELY . 
PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN RENDERING CLINICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS NOTE . 
She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission . 
This was accompanied by toe swelling , fevers to 1 0 0 . 5 and chills , but she denies pain in her L great toe . 
Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe , she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot , especially when walking . 
She denies any trauma to her left foot . 
She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable , and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr . Salgado . 
She denies any rest pain , and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year . 
She presented today to Dr . Salgado & # 8 2 1 7 ; s clinic for routine follow - up , when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam . 
Furthermore , she underwent repeat A - LENIs that demonstrated a major decline in the ABI of her R leg , suggestive of worsening peripheral vascular disease . 
She is now admitted for parenteral antibiotics and amputation of the L great toe and debridement of the R forefoot ulcer . 
No kids , closest to sister Trudy Tobacco - 5 0 pack year , currently 1 / 2 pack per day , had recently quit for 4 weeks but restarted due to & # 8 2 2 0 ; stress & # 8 2 2 1 ; . 
Tried to start Chantix , but insurance does not cover . 
No venous stasis dermatitis or bronzing , no pedal edema . 
Sensation to light touch intact in both feet . 
Deep ulcer with fibrinous exudate at base on lateral aspect of R forefoot ( at 5 th toe amputation site ) , no visible bone , no periulcer cellulitis . 
L foot with wet gangrene involving primarily plantar surface and nailbed of L great toe , visible sinus extending deeper on medial aspect of L nailbed , cellulitis and edema extending throughout toe . 
Plantar surface of L foot with superficial ulcer of ( ~ 3 x 1 cm ) overlying 5 th toe metatarsal head , no expressible drainage or fluctuance . 
Extensive scale and sclerotic nails noted on forefeet bilaterally . 
Prior ankle / brachial index ( ABI ) was . 6 9 . 
The ankle / brachial index ( ABI ) is . 8 1 . 
Pulse volume recordings ( PVR ) and segmental limb pressures suggest mild inflow aorto - iliac / common femoral / profunda femoris / or proximal superficial femoral artery disease , and popliteal / tibial vessel disease at rest . 
The toe / brachial index is . 2 8 ( taken from 2 nd toe ) . IMPRESSION 1 . 
Severe peripheral arterial disease in the right leg . 2 . 
Disease is located in the aorto - iliac , femoral , popliteal and tibial / peroneal segments and the digits on the right side . 3 . 
Mild peripheral arterial disease in the left leg . 4 . 
Disease is located in the aorto - iliac , femoral , popliteal and tibial / peroneal segments and the digits on the left side . 5 . 
There has been a significant drop in the ankle / brachial index in the right leg since the last exam , from 0 . 6 9 to 0 . 3 4 . 
Assessment and Recommendations : 5 0 yo F diabetic with active smoking and peripheral vascular disease , now with wet gangrene of L great toe . 
Was seen in ED at OSH and sent home . 
She continued to vomit , went to another hospital where she stayed for a week , and had a cholecystectomy . 
She felt better at home for 4 days after discharge , but had recurrent vomiting , back to ED , admitted again and discharged after a week - long stay . 
She now comes to PSH after four episodes of emesis yesterday . 
Pt reports intermittent periumbilical pain , which worsens right before a bout of emesis , then dies down after the emesis . 
Pain does not radiate ; pt not able to characterize frequency , duration , or quality of the pain . 
No obvious relationship between pain and PO intake . 
In between episodes of vomiting , she feels increased amount of secretions in her mouth that she has to spit out . 
Denies any dysphagia or odynophagia . 
No melena or hematochezia . 
Had had constipation , which resolved with laxatives , more recently having 2 BMs / day . 
She does not recall the workup at OSH but thinks she may have had EGD and colonoscopy already , which she reports did not show any abnormality . 
No odynophagia or dysphagia . 
No rash . 
No CP , SOB , LE edema . 
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction . 
There is a segment of terminal ileum demonstrates thickened wall . 
No significant surrounding inflammatory change . 
Question of TI thickening and gastric thickening ( but may appear that way only due to underdistention ) . 
As per pt , she has had EGD and colonoscopy at OSH already . 
Would suggest obtaining records from Fairview - Southdale Hospital first before decision regarding repeat w / u here . 
Workup may entail gastric emptying scan to assess for gastroparesis , EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for malignancy or IBD , brain imaging to r / o CNS process . 
Can continue to try Reglan 1 0 mg up to QID . 
Will staff with Dr . Otis Aguilera later today . 
She was last admitted one week ago with N / V and treated for gastroparesis . 
Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A 1 c over 1 2 in April of 2 0 8 1 . 
She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting . 
During this past year in January , she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital . 
She had a negative EGD , and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase . 
She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy . 
She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study , which was consistent with gastroparesis . 
In February , she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB , which showed significant stool . 
She presented again on 0 2 / 1 1 / 2 0 8 1 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall . 
GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 0 2 / 1 4 / 2 0 8 1 was normal , but did not visualize the terminal ileum . 
A small - bowel follow - through on 0 2 / 1 6 / 2 0 8 1 was normal . 
She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin . 
Since February , she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk - in . 
She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 2 5 0 mg four times a day and Reglan 1 0 mg twice a day . 
She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1 0 0 0 mg b . i . d . 
She was admitted from 5 / 3 1 - 6 / 2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas . 
GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax . 
She also had a head CT to r / o mass lesion causing the nausea , and this was negative . 
At the time of d / c , her nausea had decreased . 
She states that the N / V did not improve much since that admission , and she has not been able to eat much . 
She has pain throughout her abdomen . 
She denies f / c , diarrhea , constipation , dysuria , hematemesis , or melena . 
Her amylase and lipase are also elevated , raising the question of pancreatitis as well . 
Continue Reglan and erythromycin . 
GI has been consulted for further recommendations . 
Morphine prn abdominal pain . 
DM : Continue glucophage . 
Adjust insulin depending on BS . 
Seen by both GI and Endocrine . 
D / c on regimen of NPH insulin 3 0 u with Reg sliding scale before breakfast and NPH 2 0 u ( per d / c instructions , should be 2 2 u ) with Regular sliding scale before dinner . 
Thinks she had some low blood sugar reactions in the hospital , but hasn ' t had any since . 
Brings in BS record with BS in 2 0 0 ' s mostly especially during daytime . 
Nausea controlled , wary of another episode starting . 
Began Zelnorm 6 mg which she is only taking QD . 
Nexium ( ESOMEPRAZOLE ) 2 0 MG ( 2 0 MG CAPSULE DR take 1 ) PO q AM , Take 1 5 - 3 0 min before first meal of the day . 
F / u with me in one month , also has Endocrine f / u 9 / 2 0 schedulued . 
Continue sliding scale insulin . 
Reviewed that key to improving gastroparesis will be sustained BS control . 
Pt to bring in disability paperwork ; will remain off work until her f / u appt . 
Her GI symptoms began in December , 2 0 8 0 . 
Delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study , with 9 % emptying at 6 0 minutes and 2 9 % emptying at 9 0 minutes . 
Originally , she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2 0 7 6 , initially on NPH bid and then switched to Lantus . 
After her admission June 2 0 8 1 , she was placed back on NPH from what had been lantus 4 0 U qhs + metformin 1 0 0 0 bid . 
HbA 1 C was 1 2 . 2 , 4 / 2 0 8 1 , more recently it has been 1 0 . 2 in 7 / 2 0 8 1 and 1 0 . 1 on 9 / 1 4 / 2 0 8 1 . 
On her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 1 0 days ago , gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting . 
Glycemic control , however , was poor , and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale , and this was too complex for her . 
Accordingly , and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A 1 c above 1 0 , we changed her reigimen to NPH 7 0 / 3 0 5 0 Units BID . 
Her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy , nephropathy with microalbuminuria , neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet , and no known macrovascular disease . 
Gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy , but is often multifactorial . 
She was re - admitted to the PSH on 0 9 / 3 0 / 2 0 8 1 after having 2 days of nausea , vomiting , and anorexia . 
She was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ED , and was admitted for management . 
On ROSystems and history , she reports that she had been taking her new 7 0 / 3 0 insulin , 5 0 units BID . 
Sugars had been running 2 0 0 s , all the time 2 0 0 s , no better or worse . 
Nausea per her report began suddenly on Friday evening 0 9 / 2 7 and got gradually worse . 
Currently nausea has abated , but abdominal pain persists . 
Written only for insulin sliding scale . 
Glucose 5 0 0 + on admission with anion gap of 2 0 that closed rapidly with hydration . 
SH : Lives alone in Coshocton , from Herzegovina , sister in town . 
Found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with BG of 5 2 6 with anion gap of 2 0 . 
Rapidly closed anion gap to 1 0 with hydration alone . 
Abdominal pain can be multifactorial . 
I don ' t doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility , but differential includes small bowel angina ( pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky ) , hepatobiliary disease . 
With normal anion gap , I doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut , but small bowel angina is still a possibility . 
Would not hold long acting insulin . 
While NPO , have D 5 running in IVF once fingerstick drops below 2 0 0 , especially once NPH started . 
Hold if NPO or PO intake poor . 
She will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating . 
Colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year , but this does not exclude small bowel angina . 
Study of choice would be MR angiography or CT angiography of abdominal vessels . 
I do not think this is warranted at this point , but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential . 
Thank you for the consult . 
We will follow with you . 
Please call with any questions . 
Will staff in AM . 
She has a h / o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis . 
She has had an extensive GI work - up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans , gastric emptying study , colonoscopy , upper endoscopy , and small bowel follow through . 
All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study . 
She has been treated with multiple medications , including Reglan , Ativan , Compazine , and Zelnorm without much effect . 
She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain , and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping . 
The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December , but then it did not seem to be working as well . 
The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent . 
She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain , and she would like to be able to do so . 
The pain is not necessarily related to eating . 
Yesterday , she felt well and was able to eat . 
Today , she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin , and then it escalated to an 8 / 1 0 . 
She received some IV morphine , and now it is down to 4 / 1 0 . 
At Missouri Baptist Hospital , her MS Contin was held , but when her BP went up , she was restarted on it . 
They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN . 
It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 1 1 . 1 . 
However , it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 1 1 . 1 . 
Sister in area is local support ; no smoking or Etoh .

The transit time was normal . 
Extensive GI w / u has been negative except for gastric emptying study . 
GI : Pain is responsive to morphine . 
Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain . 
Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative . 
She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract . 
Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia , although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis . 
We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out . 
She did have a negative anti - endomysial Ab in 2 0 8 1 , but I think it would be worth checking both anti - endomysial Ab and anti - gliadin Ab to r / u celiac sprue again . 
We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f / u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital . 
Will continue her on her 4 0 mg dose of Lisinopril and 2 5 mg of HCTZ .

Ms . Do has had two prior hospitalizations for cellulitis / osteomyelitis . 
In 2 1 0 4 , she developed osteomyelitis following a fall , requiring surgery for debridment ( right leg ) . 
In 2 1 0 6 , she was also admitted to Seymour Hospital with cellulitis of right leg and required a 2 - week course of IV antibiotics . 
At this presentation , she has been in her usual state of health ( ET 2 5 feet , limited by pain in legs , no dyspnea , no chest pain ) until last Tuesday when she presented to her podiatrist for a corn removal ( right foot ) . 
The podiatrist made an observation that she had some erythema on the dorsal part of the foot . 
She was not experiencing any pain . 
Over this past week , she noted that the erythema and some swelling had extended , now to include the anterior portion of the lower shin . 
She presented to EFHC for a follow - up appointment , and was treated with Keflex po . 
Her cellulitis failed to improve and she presented to her PCP for evaluation on the day of admission , and was directly admitted to OGH . 
She denies any new fevers or chills ( patient is having almost daily night sweats , which have been partially relieved with standing Tylenol intake . 
These night sweats , along with the weight loss and anorexia are in the process of being worked up at this time ) . 
She has had no cough , nasal discharge , headaches , diarrhea , or dysuria / burning . 
No recent trauma to the leg .

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDES GRANULOMAS / SARCOIDOSIS . 
ISOLATED LYMPHOMA IS ALSO A CONSIDERATION . 
ON IMAGING IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE THESE PATHOLOGIES . 
TWO DISCRETE LESIONS IN THE POSTERIOR CORTEX OF RIGHT KIDNEY ARE SUSPICIOUS FOR SOLID RENAL MASS OR HYPERDENSE CYST . 
Cellulitis - this woman is predisposed to cellulitis for a number of reasons , including chronic immunosuppression , diabetes , and prior surgeries to the area that have altered the anatomy and blood supply and lymphatic drainage . 
Other potential causes include osteo or DVT . 
At this point , there is little to suspect osteo in this patient . 
Blood cultures b . 
Will also get LENIS to rule out a DVT . 
Weight loss , anorexia , night sweats , now with R kidney mass - the differential for potential causes is very broad . 
She apparently had a negative PPD last year .
